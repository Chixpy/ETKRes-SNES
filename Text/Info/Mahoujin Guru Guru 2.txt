Mahoujin GuruGuru 2 is an action-RPG from Enix that stars two children, Kukuri and Nike, a brother and sister. It is based on a comedy anime starring the same characters. In this game, the children must defeat the evil demon Giri to save the world.

Battles are fought in real-time with one player controlling two characters. This amounts to lining up the children in such a way that Nike can swing his sword and hit the enemies while Kukuri shoots her magical balls at them at the same time.
