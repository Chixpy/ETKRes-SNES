Ihatovo is a magical land created by the Japanese author Kenji Miyazawa. In the game, you are a stranger who arrives at Ihatovo and has to find seven missing notebooks by Miyazawa, to complete his stories, such as for example The Fire Stone, and others.

This is an adventure game in which you can freely navigate your character through the top-down world, in a console RPG-like fashion. There are no battles in the game and also no puzzles, although at some points you'll have to collect and to use items. The game mainly progresses thanks to conversations with various characters you encounter in Ihatovo.
