A young boy has a strange dream every night, where a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility.

This is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, as it were. One of the main differences compared to that venerable game series is the presentation. Instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon, with grim walls with rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as the enemy, it has furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, occasionally this creatures leave behind their skin, which you can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There's several shops sprinkled in each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (you can carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.

The battle system is unique. As one of the many random enemy encounters occurs, a menu appears with the Fight and Escape options. After choosing Fight, another menu pops up with Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend and Item. After choosing Punch or Kick the player is presented with a grid where a icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option access the special ability that a skin may have.
