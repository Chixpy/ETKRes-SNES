This game is quite different not only from the GameBoy title  Aretha 3, but also from the first two Aretha games for the SNES. 
Rejoice"
is
a
semi-serious
semi-comical
RPG
that
is
only
loosely
connected
to
other
Aretha
games.
The
heroes
of
the
game
are
four
thieves
who
live
in
a
small
village
occasionally
robbing
people
and
exploring
ancient
ruins
in
search
for
treasure.
One
day
a
terrible
flood
drove
the
village
inhabitants
out
of
their
houses
and
one
of
the
thieves
Treno
was
washed
away
to
a
sea
shore
near
a
forest.
There
a
mysterious
old
wizard
found
Treno
and
the
two
ventured
into
the
forest
to
find
the
way
back
home.
As
the
plot
thickens
the
heroes
discover
that
none
else
but
the
Demon
King
Howard
is
plotting
an
evil
scheme
and
they
are
the
only
ones
who
can
stop
him!"

Unlike other Aretha games, 
Rejoice"
is
not
a
turn-based
but
an
action
RPG.
Monsters
roam
the
game
world
and
you
fight
them
by
using
weapons
with
elemental
charges.
You
can
pause
the
game
at
any
time
access
the
menu
use
items
and
also
switch
characters.
You
can
also
jump
although
this
ability
is
not
an
integral
part
of
the
gameplay.
You
visit
towns
and
can
buy
weapons
armor
and
items
in
stores."
