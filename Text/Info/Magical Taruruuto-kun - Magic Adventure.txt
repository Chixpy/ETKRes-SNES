Magical Taruruuto-kun: Magic Adventure is a Super Mario-style platformer based on the anime and manga of the same name. In the game Taru must cross levels in five worlds to reach and defeat Raivar to save Honmaru's girlfriend Iyona. Taru can attack enemies in a level with his tongue, and he can also eat the many takoyaki scattered throughout the level. Takoyaki can also function as platforms, though, so they shouldn't all be eaten. At the end of a level Taru can use the takoyaki he's eaten to purchase temporary power ups. On the worldmap taru can run into friends and enemies who will challenge Taru to minigames. Win and he gains extra takoyaki and powerups.
