a
strategy
RPG

Megaten
into
a
different
genre.
You
must
lead
a
party
of
summoned
creatures
to
claim
the
victory
over
hostile
demons
who
invaded
a
futuristic
city
named
New
Tokyo.
The
gameplay
is
round-based.
You
issue
commands
to
your
party
moving
around
the
battle
field
using
magic
or
attacking
your
enemies
physically.
At
that
moment
a
short
automatic
battle
occurs
whose
outcome
is
determined
by
character
parameters.
You
create
your
hero
by
allocating
available
skill
points
and
then
improve
his
stats
by
level
up."
