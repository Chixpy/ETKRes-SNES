This game follows the story of volumes 8 to 11 of the manga. Lingling discovers a letter left by Fujii, where he reports about a strange tribe that can control beasts. Yakumo is ordered to travel to Nepal, but first he has to find more information about the mysterious tribe by contacting people in Hong-Kong.

The game is a mixture of puzzle-solving adventure and platform action, with the emphasis on the first. Yakumo moves around the gameworld, picking objects and manipulating them in order to solve puzzles, and talking to characters. But he can also jump, climb on ladders, run, and sometimes fight enemies in platform-style.
