You are a young boy named Latok, who lives in a village, training to become a good fighter. One day he meets a Pixie who tells him his father was a godly warrior who has fought the evil demon Badou two hundred fifty years ago, and has sealed his soul. But now the seal was broken, and Latok, as the last in the great family of warriors, has to prevent Badou's resurrection at all costs!

This is an action RPG, in which you fight enemies in real time. Defeated enemies give you experience points, and you level up as you gather them. You need to meet minimum level requirements in order to wield better weapons and to equip better armor.
