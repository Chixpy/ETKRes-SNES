Dark Kingdom lets you experience a traditional story of a Japanese RPG from 
the
other
side".
In
this
game
you
play
the
role
of
a
mercenary
named
Gene
Dorman.
Instead
of
becoming
a
world-saving
paladin
Gene
joins
forces
with
the
Demon
King
himself!
He
offers
his
services
to
him
and
receives
from
him
various
assignments.
Gene
doesn't
yet
know
that
fate
will
make
his
path
cross
with
that
of
the
good
hero
Lux
with
whom
he
shares
a
mysterious
connection..."

Gene must complete the missions of the Demon King in a specified order, and each time he completes a mission, his rank raises, allowing him access to higher levels of the hierarchy of the Demon King Castle, new abilities, etc. Other servants of the Demon King join him on his mission, and fight together with him as a party. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock with day and night cycle.
