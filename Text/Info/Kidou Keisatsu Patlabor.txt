This is an RPG that was only released on the SNES, which also shares its name with several other titles across different systems, due to them all being based on the same Anime series 
Patlabor"."
In this RPG, you control the two main pilots from the series/films, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as you complete your typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents. The game, only having been released in Japan, is only really advisable to play if you understand Japanese, as it really is a text-heavy game.
The gameplay consists of three screens - a map of Japan, showing where your asignments are located, the 
main"
screen
where
you
control
your
Labor
from
a
top-down
viewpoint
and
maneuver
it
around
the
area
of
the
crime.
Finally
there's
the
combat
screen
for
when
you
press
the
action
button
to
attack
a
rogue
Labor.
From
here
you
can
select
one
of
various
attacks;
naturally
as
the
game
goes
on
your
pilots
can
learn
new
attacks
though
unusually
for
an
RPG
there's
also
the
option
to
just
talk
with
the
rogue
Labor's
pilot
and
try
to
convince
them
to
back
down
-
as
a
policeman
sometimes
this
is
the
only
way
forward."
This is a fairly typical Eastern RPG with a fairly unique setting. Just don't forget your Kanji-English dictionary!
