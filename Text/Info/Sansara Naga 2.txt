Ten
years
ago
the
elder
of
the
village
Ryuen
found
you
a
little
child
near
the
village
gate.
Nobody
knew
where
you
came
from
but
in
your
hands
you
were
holding
an
egg.
This
egg
was
carefully
preserved
and
now
after
ten
years
a
dragon
has
hatched
from
it
-
a
white
dragon
who
can
talk!
It
became
clear
that
you
are
one
of
the
legendary
Dragonriders.
Now
the
Elder
has
a
new
task
for
you.
The
Dragonrider
Amrita
who
has
been
taking
good
care
of
you
during
those
ten
years
has
betrayed
the
Guild
set
the
Guild's
warehouse
on
fire
and
fled
Ryuen
with
her
dragon.
It
is
your
mission
to
locate
her
to
bring
her
back
and
to
find
out
why
she
disappeared."

You travel to eight different worlds, learning more about the legendary race of dragons and their dragonriders. You can recruit dragons to your party. Each dragon has a unique ability - one can swim, another one can use magic, etc. The regular enemies are random, and you fight them in turn-based combat viewed form first-person perspective.When you defeat a monster, you have a choice of either feeding your dragon with it (it restores the dragons' hit points), or carrying it with you and then selling it in a town. Your weapons can wear off if you use them a lot. At some point you can also buy pigs and then cook them to produce healing items.
