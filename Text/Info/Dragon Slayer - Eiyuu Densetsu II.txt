Years have passed since prince Selios, the hero of the first game, defeated the demon god Agunija in the ultimate battle. Peace returned to the land of Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?

The second 
Dragon
Slayer"
is
very
similar
to
the
first
game
graphically
and
gameplay-wise.
The
only
major
difference
is
the
fact
that
the
enemies
are
now
completely
visible
on
screen
before
battles
so
that
the
player
can
avoid
fighting
them
if
he
wants
to.
Otherwise
it
is
a
traditional
Japanese
RPG
with
turn-based
combat
viewed
from
first-person
perspective.
The
Genesis
version
has
once
again
updated
graphics."
