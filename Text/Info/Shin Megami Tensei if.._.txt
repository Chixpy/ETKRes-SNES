A tranquil day, like most days. Even boring, like most days. The days of youth are flowing along. If... it was destroyed? If... this school was thrown into a separate world? This is the story of boys and girls who were suddenly thrust into the Demon World
and are now lost...


Shin
Megami
Tensei
If..."
is
a
follow-up
to
the
two
classic
SNES
games.
You
choose
your
main
character
in
the
beginning
of
the
game
(by
default
it
is
the
girl
Tamaki
a
character
from
the
future
Persona
series).
Something
weird
is
happening
in
the
perfectly
ordinary
Karukozaka
high
school.
One
of
the
students
made
contact
to
a
different
universe
that
co-exists
with
modern-day
Japan.
With
the
help
of
your
fellow
students
you
must
investigate
the
matter
and
stop
the
insane
plans
of
the
student."

The gameplay contains typical Megami Tensei features such as demon summoning, demon fusion, and the ability to talk to enemies before (or instead of) fighting them. Enemies will react differently depending on your approach during conversation. The battles utilize a turn-based engine.
