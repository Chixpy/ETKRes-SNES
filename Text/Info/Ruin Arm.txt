This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and his party. You can either let the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.
