Ryu
Knight"
is
based
on
an
animé
series
of
the
same
name.
The
story
of
the
game
is
simple:
you
are
Adyu
an
apprentice
knight
who
spends
all
his
time
training.
One
day
a
mysterious
old
man
appears
out
of
nowhere
approaches
Adyu
and
tells
him
the
world
needs
more
paladins
and
therefore
you
must
train
harder
in
order
to
become
one.
He
sends
you
on
a
quest
to
find
a
legendary
weapon
which
is
broken
into
twelve
parts
each
part
being
hidden
in
a
different
place.
He
also
entrusts
you
with
the
power
of
Ryu
a
huge
magical
armor
that
grants
the
hero
who
equips
it
immense
power.
This
is
where
Adyu's
journey
begins!"

The game is an action RPG, somewhat similar to  Ys series. Adyu wanders through the world and fights enemies in real-time combat, using melee weapons. He can also jump to avoid enemy attacks. You gain experience after defeating monsters and advance in levels. You can summon the armor Ryu at any time, which makes you much stronger, but you can't go through narrow corridors and climb up stairs when in Ryu form. The game features mostly open areas populated by enemies with an occasional town thrown in. The structure of the game is non-linear: you can visit almost any area of the map at any time.
