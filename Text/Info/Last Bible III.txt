Last
Bible
III"
is
a
sequel
to
two
Last
Bible
games
for
GameBoy
and
GameBoy
Color.
You
control
Shieru
a
young
boy
who
lives
in
a
small
village
on
a
planet
with
a
medieval
civilization.
With
the
help
of
his
friends
he
should
fulfill
an
ancient
prophecy
and
defeat
the
evil
that
threatens
the
planet.
In
order
to
do
that
the
heroes
of
the
game
have
to
recruit
demons
who
will
help
them
in
battles."

As a part of Megaten universe, 
Last
Bible
III"
is
focused
on
demon
summoning
and
fusion.
The
concept
is
more
developed
in
this
game
since
demons
are
now
fully
customizable
characters
that
can
level
up
and
be
equipped
just
like
human
party
members.
Unlike
most
Megaten
games
Last Bible III
is
set
in
a
medieval
environment
and
has
a
more
traditional
flair.
The
battles
are
viewed
from
first
person
perspective
in
a
standard
Megaten
fashion
but
movement
on
the
world
map
in
towns
and
in
dungeons
is
controlled
from
third
person
perspective
with
a
top-down
view."
