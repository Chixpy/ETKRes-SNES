European version
==========
There are a few changes in the European SNES version:

* During the intro, a cigarette was removed
* In the Japanese version, the clown enemies in stage two have a Christian cross. This was changed to a wind-up key.
* A background picture of a naked woman in level three, a parody of The Birth of Venus, was removed.
* The licking animations of the stage three bosses were removed.
* The bunny costumes and ears of female enemies in stage seven were removed.
