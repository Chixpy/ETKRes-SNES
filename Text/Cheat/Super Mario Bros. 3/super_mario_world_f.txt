     UPDATES
     =======

9-28-03: Finally! After seven long months, I've gotten around to telling how
         to get the three 1-ups in the Forest Secret Area - with a little help
         from my e-mail friends =D
           The following people e-mailed me with the method for getting those
         bothersome 1-ups, and here are their names, in no particular order:

   Wayne Kao
   Jason Praditbatuga
   Christopher P. Langevin
   Azrial Borden
   Joe Val'Istar
   Seth Strife
   Dave Stocker (twice!)
   Drew Smith
   Jesse Anderson
   Jordan Leung
   Karri Holmberg
   Santeri Saarimaa
   and two others who just supplied an e-mail address, which I won't reprint
     here because I'm not stupid.

Also, I fixed a formatting problem that occurred near the end of the document,
causing two of the headers to stretch out into infinity and make a pesky
horizontal scroll bar appear at the bottom of the screen. This has been
rectified as well.

     INTRO AND STORY
     ===============

Hello, and welcome to my 28th FAQ, an exhaustive, encyclopedic walkthrough for
Super Mario World, the SNES's very first release which introduced Yoshi into
the scheme of things and remains one of the greatest, best-selling 16-bit
titles to this very day. I've taken a four-month sabbatical from writing FAQs
to focus on my reviewing talents (which I've found I have a definite niche
for), but after a hearty examination of more of my favorite games from days of
yore and finding they have quite lacking coverage yet still, I'm ready to end
this hiatus and get back in the game with this totally in-depth look at the 96
levels of Super Mario World.

Super Mario World took the series into further uncharted territory, sending
Mario and Co. to a prehistoric archipelago known as Dinosaur Land. Bowser
Koopa, that mean old Mushroom Kingdom dictator and single father of seven, has
captured Princess Toadstool (Peach, Princess P.T., or what have you) AGAIN
(yawn) and carted her off to his seemingly impenetrable fortress, presumably to
make him his ever-loving wife through the bonds of holy matrimony. In order to
thwart any attempt by the islanders to stage an upheaval, he's encased the
indigenous reptilian life, known as Yoshis, inside spotted eggs to keep them
from rising up and defeating him themselves.

Ever the intrepid hero, Mario crashes bravely onto the island and brings along
his brother Luigi, who stands in the shadows for yet _another_ turn, to save
Peach from Bowser, his seven ugly, dwarfish Koopa runt kids, and the gruesome
aftereffects of unholy Koopa love. Are they up to the challenge? Of course they
are! They're the Mario Bros., and plumbing's their game! They found the secret
warp zone while they were workin' on the ....... sorry, it was a profound
nostalgic moment. Couldn't resist. Anyway, on with the walkthrough!

=============================================================================

     ITEMS & POWER-UPS
     =================

Mario has many power-ups to assist him on his journey through Dinosaur Land.
Though this section will be of little interest to aficionados of the game, it
should be a great help to those just digging into the game who want to know
what kind of help they've got to back them up.

----
Coin
----
What would a Mario game be without a bunch of coins to collect along the way?
As per the usual, 100 coins equal one extra life. Coins can be received by
picking up those that can float or from question blocks, or they can also be
collected by shooting certain vulnerable enemies with fireballs or through the
help of certain other items (e.g. the silver P-switch).

-------------------
Multiple Coin Block
-------------------
Depending on how fast you hit this block, you can usually cadge anywhere from
two to 22 coins out of a block like this. If you find that you've stumbled upon
one, keep hitting it until you've totally exhausted the supply that it held.
Twirling your cape is the fastest way to get coins out of one of these blocks.

--------
Mushroom
--------
The Mushroom is an essential item in Mario Bros. lore. It serves its purpose in
this game as well as it does in all the others: to turn a pitiful and weak
2-foot-tall version of Mario into a strapping plumber who can jump higher, hit
harder, and eat more pasta in one sitting. The Mushroom is the most basic
power-up in the game: most other more powerful items will override its ability
by giving you some other power in addition to making you big (i.e. the Fire
Flower, the Cape Feather).

When you complete the Yellow Switch Palace, all yellow blocks with an
exclamation point on them will contain Mushrooms.

-----------
Fire Flower
-----------
Another perennial item of the SMB universe. Mario's outfit will revert to warm
colors (red, white) for the occasion when you pick up one of these. Fireballs
can be fired rather rapidly with repeated tapping of the Y button, but you can
shoot two at a time by performing a spin jump with the A button.

------------
Cape Feather
------------
Changing over from the raccoon tail pinned to his butt (SMB3) to a more
practical cape adds a whole new dimension to Mario's flying capabilities.
Whereas in that game Mario's tail petered out after a couple of seconds of
flying, the cape gives Mario the ability to fly indefinitely with the right
button combination. (See Special Techniques for details - this really is a
handy maneuver, and one you ought to learn if you want to get some of the more
well-hidden secrets the game has to offer.) Of course, when you're tired of
flying, you can also glide slowly back to the ground by holding Y.

When you complete the Green Switch Palace, all green blocks with an exclamation
point on them will contain Cape Feathers.

-------
Starman
-------
Starmen have made Mario temporarily invincible since time immemorial. With one
of these equipped, you'll find it best to blow through a level without any
regard as to anything you might have missed (you can always replay it and take
your time later). If you kill enough enemies while invincible, the points
multiply and eventually add up to extra lives. A couple of levels, mentioned in
the walkthrough as you go along, really facilitate this kind of extra life
hoarding.

-------------
1-Up Mushroom
-------------
They have the same basic shape and appearance as a normal Mushroom, but they
are a light green on the cap. If you've played SMB1 or SMB3 at all, you have a
general idea of what they look like already. 1-up Mushrooms come to you in a
variety of ways. You can get them out of question blocks and bonus game blocks,
and there are even enemies who lure you to them by putting a 1-up Mushroom on a
fishing rod! Unbelievable!

---------
Yoshi Egg
---------
There are a couple of different kinds of Yoshi Eggs. The most common are green
ones, out of which appear a fully-grown adult green Yoshi. When you board
Yoshi, he serves as a way to get to some hidden areas and as an extra hit
(he'll take off running and leave you in the dust if you get hit while riding
him).

Yoshi's tongue maneuvering and ability to eat enemies are his most practical
skills. Some enemies he will just swallow and be done with them, which is
equivalent to grabbing one coin. However, when he brings a Koopa-Troopa shell
into his mouth, it can have one of many different effects when spit out
depending on its color.

RED SHELLS will come out as a trio of fireballs that expand outward to cover
more surface area; these fireballs will turn any enemy that they come into
contact with into a coin. YELLOW SHELLS are best used while staying in Yoshi's
mouth. When he jumps on the ground and his cheeks are puffy from the yellow
shell, two dust clouds will squeeze out from his feet, killing most weaker
enemies and turning those such as Koopa-Troopas and Goombas over on their
backs. BLUE SHELLS probably have the greatest effect of all: when they are in
Yoshi's mouth, he'll be able to fly. Use this to get over some particularly
tricky levels.

Green Yoshis do not comprise the only color in the dino spectrum, though. Along
the Star Road you will find Yoshi Eggs of different colors - namely, red,
yellow, and blue. These three Yoshis will take the color of Koopa-Troopa shell
they correspond with and derive that ability from ANY color shell. For example,
if you are riding a red Yoshi, all shells that you swallow will be regurgitated
as fireballs - not just red ones. Similarly, a blue Yoshi can fly when he
ingests any color of shell, as opposed to all the other Yoshis who can only fly
when they eat a blue shell.

These red, yellow, and blue Yoshis all start out as babies that you carry
around as you would any other item, such as a key or a Koopa-Troopa shell. To
make them grow into adults, feed them five enemies or one item, whether from
your spare item box or somewhere in the level. The only exception to this is
Blue Yoshi, which you can procure by getting a pair of Yoshi's Wings and
completing the subsequent bonus stage. The Yoshi you took into the level will
exit as a blue Yoshi, regardless of what color he was before entering the bonus
stage.

------------
Dragon Coins
------------
In every level with a goal there are five Dragon Coins (occasionally six, but
it's rare), which can be distinguished from regular coins in that they are
larger and have Yoshi's likeness shamelessly plastered on each and every one.
They are worth 1000 points for the first one, 2000 for the second, 4000 for the
third, 8000 for the fourth, and will net you an extra life if you collect all
five, plus another one if there happens to be six in a level (which, again, is
rare).

-----------
Key/Keyhole
-----------
On the map, levels with two separate exits are identified by a red dot. You
must beat the level both ways to receive credit for completing it, and often
the second exit comes via keyhole. Where there is a keyhole in a level, there
is a key. Find the key and take it to the keyhole to complete the level. Not
all levels with two exits have a keyhole as one of the exits, so keep your eyes
open for those annoying exceptions.

------------------------------
Exclamation Point ("!") Blocks
------------------------------
If you haven't completed the Switch Palace that goes with a certain color of
"!" block, the block will show up as a dotted-line square. These will be filled
in when you complete the corresponding Switch Palace. Yellow "!" blocks will
always always ALWAYS have Mushrooms in them, and Cape Feathers can be found in
green "!" blocks without exception. Red and blue "!" blocks have nothing in
them and can be used as separate ledges in their own right or as stepping
stones to previously inaccessible areas.

-------------
Yoshi's Wings
-------------
Rare but wonderful, these godsends of relief will instantly whisk you out of a
level and take you to a bonus stage wherein you will fly on a blue Yoshi
attempting to grab either normal or Dragon Coins. They will only work if you're
onboard a Yoshi, so be on top of one for those occasions when you locate some.

---------
P-Balloon
---------
When you touch one of these babies, your body will inflate to a morbidly obese
circumference and you'll be able to float slowly upward through the air.
Controlling your body while inflated to such an enormous width is quite a tall
order, so make sure you know what you're doing when you grab one of these. You
cannot ride Yoshi while your body is inflated. If you are hit while inflated,
you will both deflate and lose your current power-up (if applicable).

-------------
Blue P-Switch
-------------
Making a return appearance after debuting in SMB3, the blue P-switch turns all
coins into brown "used" blocks. It is necessary to use these newly formed brown
blocks to cross wide chasms in some levels. By the same token, brown blocks
that are present in the level when you hit a blue P-switch will be turned into
coins. The blue P-switch only lasts for a few seconds, so take advantage of it
while you can.

---------------
Silver P-Switch
---------------
Here's an item that's got a bit of a pleasant twist on your everyday
namby-pamby blue P-switch. This meaty item will turn any enemies present into
silver coins, which will grant you extra lives by multiples of two if you can
grab enough of them up within the time limit of the switch. Since silver coins
don't show up as normal objects in a level, don't expect to see enemies appear
out of the blue when you hit one of these. You're totally safe.

------------
Silver Coins
------------
Silver coins come about as the result of hitting a silver P-switch (see above).
If you grab enough within the silver switch's time limit, you can gain 1-ups
and even 2-ups.

---------
3-up Moon
---------
These are often well-hidden from the basic ground view that many of the levels
provide. Many take an extra special bit of burrowing or flying high to locate,
and they are few in number, so look extra hard for them. As is stated by the
name of the item, you'll gain three extra men at a pop if you procure one of
these special rarities.

----------------
Green Star Block
----------------
If you receive 30 coins throughout the course of a single level when you hit
this block, a 1-up will pop out. If you have 29 or less, it will act as just
another regular old coin block.

-----------------
Transparent Block
-----------------
Inside these blocks are four items that rotate at one-second (real time)
intervals. Depending on the position it's in when you hit it, the item will
keep changing and you can get either a Mushroom, a Fire Flower, a Cape Feather,
or a Starman. Transparent blocks do not change shape or color when hit.

----------------------
Directional Coin Block
----------------------
Many, many coins will pop out of this block, but they don't stop, oh no.
They'll keep coming out in whatever direction you hold, whether it be up, down,
left, or right. The chain will only stop when it hits another object or runs
into itself, despite the music that plays when you hit one of these blocks. In
a big room, this item has the potential to be worth at least one 1-up.

------------
Empty Shells
------------
Sometimes you'll find empty Koopa-Troopa shells just lying around, waiting to
be picked up, kicked, or inhabited by a naked turtle. They are often sitting
around by themselves as a subtle hint that something near you can be reached
with it, or naked turtles may be sitting right in front of them ready to hop in
and attack you.

-----------
Red Berries
-----------
Yoshi can eat red berries that grow on bushes if you stick your tongue out at
them or simply run his mouth into them. If he eats enough of them, he'll poop
out an item (usually a mushroom).

------------
Pink Berries
------------
Pink berries also grow on bushes and take a lot fewer to activate the special
prize associated with them: a stupidly grinning cloud that drops coins sporting
an even goofier grin. They act as normal coins but will yield 1-ups if you
follow the cloud around long enough. Eventually the cloud floats back up to the
firmament, so get those happy coins while they last.

-------------
Green Berries
-------------
Only one level sports these elusive jade wonders, but you don't need them much
of the time except in that one level, seeing as how every green berry you
swallow adds 20 seconds to your time for that level. If you're strapped for
seconds and there are a couple of these in your neighborhood, then you would do
well to chow down on a few of them.

--------------------
Portable Springboard
--------------------
Unlike the springboards of days since past that were stationary and didn't
allow for very much jump support, many bounce pads in this game allow you to
carry them around and take them to areas where they are needed. Either you can
carry them or Yoshi can carry one in his mouth, but be warned: he will swallow
it if it stays in his cheeks long enough.

=============================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================================================================

     SPECIAL TECHNIQUES
     ==================

The following moves often take more than one button press or a series of
smaller techniques that add up to one big one to perform. With these moves you
can reach more of the very well-hidden areas in the game or find different ways
around levels. Let's look at some of the special techniques.

SOARING IN THE AIR
------------------
HOW TO EXECUTE: Run by holding Y and moving forward, then press B to jump.
EFFECT: Mario will jump higher than normal. If you have a cape on, then he
        can often soar far above the screen in most cases.

GROUND POUND
------------
HOW TO EXECUTE: If you have the cape, do the soaring high-jump, then hold Y
                and Down at the same time.
EFFECT: Mario will hit the ground and cause an earth-shattering tremor that
        will kill most landlubbers and cause Koopa Troopas to retreat to
        their shells.

FLYING
------
HOW TO EXECUTE: If you have the cape, do the soaring high-jump, then hold Y
                and press both Left and Right in a fluid motion. To gain
                altitude, press the buttons somewhat faster and at even
                intervals.
EFFECT: Flying reveals some of the best secrets this game has to offer, and
        improves on the temporariness of the raccoon tail power-up from SMB3.
        By holding onto the cape and pressing the buttons above, you can
        literally stay in the air indefinitely. Remember that while flying
        you can hold Y and Down simultaneously to do the Ground Pound, which
        in addition to killing people is also a great way to get yourself
        down to Earth in a hurry.

MIDAIR DISMOUNT
---------------
HOW TO EXECUTE: While on Yoshi, jump with B, then press A.
EFFECT: Instead of spin jumping off Yoshi as you do when you're on the
        ground, you will execute a jump that is a little higher than your
        normal jump but not as high as Super Mario's running jump. Use it
        when you're about to fall to your death into the abyss and you feel
        the sudden urge to spare yourself, or to get items that are normally
        far out of your normal jumping reach.

EXTRA LIVES THROUGH INVINCIBILITY
---------------------------------
HOW TO EXECUTE: Get a Starman and then kill at least nine enemies by
                barreling through them with your invincible self.
EFFECT: For every enemy you kill after the ninth, you will gain another extra
        life. Some enemies are big enough as to yield two extra lives (e.g.
        Wigglers). There are a few levels that facilitate the use of this fun
        trick quite nicely (Forest of Illusion 1, Awesome).

LIFE TRADING
------------
HOW TO EXECUTE: In two-player mode, press L to bring up a menu displaying
                Mario's and Luigi's total lives. Press B to transfer lives
                from Luigi to Mario, and Y to transfer lives from Mario to
                Luigi. Press Start to close the menu when you have the
                correct amount of lives set.
EFFECT: This is sort of a handicap for the one of you playing that isn't as
        good as the other. The better player can obviously operate on fewer
        lives and can find a way to replenish his or her supply, leaving the
        not-as-good player with some insurance lives in case they happen to
        die a lot.

     BESTIARY
     ========

What follows are (for the most part) encyclopedic entries on every enemy in the
game arranged into appropriate categories. If it's against you at some point in
this game, it's located right here in this section. Sure, you can choose to
skip over it and you probably will, but it's useful as a reference in case you
ever need it.

     A. Classic SMB Standbys
        ** New Variations
     B. Dinosaur Enemies
     C. Chucks
     D. Aquatic Life
     E. Cave Dwellers
     F. Ghost House Tenants
     G. Bowser's Minions
     H. Miscellaneous Enemies

A. CLASSIC SMB STANDBYS
=======================

Koopa Troopa
------------
Back from the 8-bit days, these turtle enemies can now come already in their
shells or totally naked and ready to hop into one. They come in shells of
green, red, blue, and yellow. Green and yellow Koopa Troopas will have a
tendency to walk like lemmings off of any edge while red and blue Koopa Troopas
will stay true to their own ledges. Several of them may also have wings, in
which case the green and yellow ones will only be able to bounce along the
ground while the reds and the blues can actually fly in formation.

Goomba
------
Taking on a decidedly more rounded appearance than in games past, Goombas must
now be thrown at each other to be killed - a simple bop on the head won't cut
the mustard any longer. Yoshi can also eat them if you need to get rid of one
in a fix. There is a winged variant of Goombas that bounce along the ground
rather than actually fly.

Bullet Bill
-----------
As in the olden days, Bullet Bills can either shoot at random heights from an
undetermined source or come fresh out of a bullet machine. Now they can even
come at you four at a time from all sides of the screen!

Piranha Plant
-------------
Piranha Plants actually only appear in a select few levels in this game, and
even then they do not come out of pipes facing upward at all. They are only
seen as upside-down regular Piranha Plants, and are fairly easy to dispatch of.

Bob-omb
-------
These are of the Mario 3 variety that walk around calmly until their fuse is
expended and then blow up (as opposed to the Mario 2 variety that run around
chaotically before exploding). You can pick them up and kick them into other
enemies.

Buzzy Beetle
------------
These reclusive bugs wisely choose to remain as cave dwellers. They are
impervious to fire but can't seem to withstand being jumped on. As with almost
all other walking enemies, you can pick them up and kick them when they've
retreated to the insides of their shells.

Spiny
-----
Best known as Lakitu's lackeys, they can cause quite a sticky situation if too
many are on the ground at one time. As you can see, it would hurt quite a bit
to jump on them, so rely on a good old fireball or the shell of another enemy
to bring them down.

Lakitu
------
Often before releasing his endless hordes of Spinys on you, Lakitu will carry a
fishing rod with a 1-up attached to the end. Grab it and then he'll start
releasing them, or ignore him to stave off the onslaught just that much longer.
If you kill Lakitu with a Koopa Troopa shell or other throwable object as
opposed to jumping on him, his cloud will stay behind and you can ride in it
temporarily. Use this time to access new areas or secrets that are nestled way
up in the clouds.

Hammer Brothers
---------------
The hammer-tossing turtles of SMB fame have made a landmark change, now
assaulting you with hammers from the skies only on gray flying ledges. Bump him
from underneath to knock him out. This is the best course of action, as almost
any aerial assault is an exercise in suicide.

Pokey
-----
Remember the annoying cactus from SMB2 that it was a chore to jump over? He's
back now, but is more tolerable because Yoshi can eat him segment by segment.
The closer you let Pokey get to Yoshi, the more segments Yoshi will eat at one
time.

Volcano Lotus
-------------
No longer waterbound as they were in SMB3, it's easy to get rid of these
fire-shooting menaces with either a graceful twirl of your cape or the almighty
tongue of Yoshi. They do, however, often plant themselves (no pun intended) in
very annoying spots, so watch how you cross them.

**VARIATIONS ON OLD ENEMIES**

Banzai Bill
-----------
Like a normal Bullet Bill, but writ extremely large. It is often possible to
clear them with a running jump or wait them out by ducking, and a simple bump
on the noggin will do them in with ease.

Jumping Piranha Plant
---------------------
These enemies seem to be Nintendo's answer for not having normal Piranha Plants
that come out of pipes as usual. These can appear from pipes that face up and
from certain small bushes. There is another version of them that can
expectorate fireballs also.

Para-Goomba/Para-Bomb
---------------------
Goombas and Bob-ombs that parachute from the sky will start walking once they
alight upon the ground. Aside from their tendency to fall from the sky, they're
no different from normal Goombas and Bob-ombs.

Pipe-Dwelling Lakitu
--------------------
Some Lakitus prefer to poke their heads out of the pipes every now and then to
toss a Spiny your way. They're best eliminated by a quick hit to the skull.

Spike Top
---------
This altered version of Spiny with but a lone spike on its back has the added
ability of walking with ease along any surface, meaning it can climb walls and
walk on ceilings without any apparent problems. Fireballs or Koopa Troopa
shells are the best way to deal with this menace.

Sumo Brother
------------
Gone away are the Boomerang, Fire, and Sledge Brothers of SMB3; here to stay is
the Sumo Brother, a heavy tub o' lard who can make lightning fall to ledges
below with one stomp of his mighty boot upon the ground. They don't take kindly
to having their heads stomped on, so your best choice would be taking them out
from below if and when there's an opening between their lightning spurts.


B. DINOSAUR ENEMIES
===================

Rex
---
This dimwit walks forward with little thought for what is in front of him. He
can be dispatched of in a variety of ways. One normal jump will squash him down
flat and make him walk faster, and the second normal jump will destroy him
completely. More effective ways of ridding yourself of him in one hit include
spin jumps, fireballs, and having Yoshi digest him.

Dino Rhino
----------
A large lumbering beast indigenous to Chocolate Island. They have no defense
against you and will turn into the much smaller Dino Torch if pegged on the
head with a normal jump.

Dino Torch
----------
Dino Torches move a lot faster than their massive Dino Rhino counterparts and
can jump to ledges slightly higher than the ones they are on. If you linger
above them too long, they can turn their heads skyward and shoot a steady
stream of flames at you.


C. CHUCKS
=========

Chargin' Chuck
--------------
"Chucks" in Super Mario World refers to those enemies in the American football
get-up whose attacks are based on the themes of a number of sports. Here,
Chargin' Chuck represents the sport that's only famous in the United States -
football. It's Chargin' Chuck's job to charge at you like a relentless
linebacker. A couple of jumps on the head ought to bring him down, but be
careful when jumping on a Chuck's helmet. A certain degree of entropy factors
into the direction you bounce off in, meaning you can go flying off a cliff if
you're not careful. Try to veer back toward him so you can keep bouncing on his
head 'til he's dead.

Splittin' Chuck
---------------
Splittin' Chuck divides into three separate Chargin' Chucks if you get too
close to him. Approach this trio with extreme caution.

Bouncin' Chuck
--------------
As the name suggests, Bouncin' Chuck will leap at you at roundabout a 15-degree
arc if you get too close to him. Once you bounce off his helmet one time, he'll
revert back to a plain old Chargin' Chuck.

Whistlin' Chuck
---------------
Depending on whether he is underwater or on land, Whistlin' Chuck can summon
either a horde of normal fish or Super Koopas to come after you. One knock to
the cranium will make him give up the whistling game and switch back to
charging at you.

Clappin' Chuck
--------------
All Clappin' Chucks do is jump in the air and clap endlessly until you bounce
on them, at which point they regress to the charging attack. They pose one of
the least threats of all the different types of Chucks.

Puntin' Chuck
-------------
This football-themed Chuck will kick an endless supply of footballs at you.
Because of their shape (the footballs), the way they bounce is very chaotic, so
don't try to chance running under them. Go over the footballs, as they can be
jumped on and eradicated like a normal enemy (such as a Koopa Troopa). Get to
Puntin' Chuck's head as fast as possible to stop the footballs from coming at
you.

Pitchin' Chuck
--------------
Pitchin' Chucks throw baseballs at you six at a time: three on the ground and
three in midair, at which time they then pause for a moment. Avoid the
baseballs and jump on his head in that short time frame when there are no
baseballs being tossed around.

Diggin' Chuck
-------------
Golf club in hand, Diggin' Chuck will pitch a series of spherical boulders your
way. They have very little bounce to them at all, and Yoshi is capable of
eating them, so move past them and get him on the head. If you can get rid of
this menace, who is usually placed in such a way that it's difficult to get him
square on the helmet, consider yourself par for the course.


D. AQUATIC LIFE
===============

Cheep-Cheep
-----------
In this game, they've been reduced to the mere pittance of swimming toward you
in underwater levels. Only in one level do they fly at you in the old annoying
SMB-style arc. In some levels with water just below the land, there is a
variety of Cheep-Cheep that jumps straight up out of the water after swimming
around for a little bit.

Rip Van Fish
------------
This slumbering fish stays asleep until you get near it, at which point it
wakes up and starts to home in on you. Fireballs or cape twirling work best
against him, as well as Yoshi's ability to eat him.

Urchin
------
These spiky guys float in many kinds of patterns: vertically, horizontally, and
counterclockwise or clockwise around walls and suspended ledges. They're
practically impervious to all forms of attack, so wait them out and pass them
when you have a free moment or float through them if you're endowed with
temporary invincibility.

Dolphins
--------
ALERT! ALERT! DOLPHINS ARE YOUR FRIENDS! SERIOUSLY! They pose no threat to you
at all and serve a great purpose as ledges that bounce in formation out of the
water like synchronized swimmers. They will allow you to stay in the air in
above-ground water levels, keeping you safely out of the reach of some very
annoying enemies such as Porcu-Puffers. Make use of their platforming
facilities as often as you can.

Torpedo Ted
-----------
These slyly grinning missile enemies are like an underwater variation of Bullet
Bills that are released from their turrets more rapidly. Although they're only
found in one level, they are EXTREMELY difficult to bypass without getting hit.
Take extreme caution when approaching a Torpedo Ted turret and swim around them
as quickly as you can.

Fishbone
--------
Through they only move in a straight line, these skeletal fish stripped of all
their scales can be quite annoying. Ride out their passage by staying over or
under them and then pass on as usual.

Porcu-Puffer
------------
These are fat fish who float along the surface of the water in above-ground
water levels, waiting for you to fall into their deadly grasp. If you get in a
bind, spin jumps ought to protect you from the lethal spikes gracing its back.
If at all possible though, stay very far above their range.


E. CAVE DWELLERS
================

Swooper Bat
-----------
Hanging out on the ceilings of cavernous levels, there are two types of Swooper
Bats; one that waits for a little bit before coming down at you and one that
will swoop down as soon as it appears on the screen. They can be easily
conquered with just about any type of hit, from normal jumps to cape twirling
to Yoshi's tongue.

Mega Mole
---------
A larger cousin of the annoying little Monty Moles can be found in a couple of
the game's later cave areas. Not even Super Mario can bring these guys down by
crashing down on their heads. Consider them invincible (though there are ways
of eliminating them) and bypass them whenever you encounter them.

Bony Beetle
-----------
Though they can also be found in some of the Koopa Kids' castles, you'll mostly
see Bony Beetles in dank cave-like areas. They can be jumped on and disposed of
temporarily a la Dry Bones, but only when their shells are normal. They can
duck to reveal some dangerous, pointy spikes that should by no means be jumped
on. Cape twirling will destroy them indefinitely.

Blargg
------
Here's one insane googly-eyed dinosaur that you don't want to (PUN ALERT!) fall
in lava with! Baha! Now that that bad joke is behind us, the thing is that you
don't want to cross paths with this stark-raving lunatic. He waits in the magma
pits mainly while you're riding along the skull platforms. Jumping over him is
always the best course of action.


F. GHOST HOUSE TENANTS
======================

Boo Buddy
---------
The regular ghost as seen in SMB3 (where they operated there under the moniker
Boo Diddly). Boo Buddies will follow you when your back is turned to them but
will freeze in place if you are facing them. Use this to your advantage where
possible, but if you must turn your back them, get away as fast as possible.

Big Boo
-------
A large version of the smaller Boo Buddies you find. Leap over him with the
help of a springboard or avoid him altogether - he's usually high enough in the
air that you can sprint under him.

Big Boo Boss
------------
The boss of the Boo Buddies. Peculiarly, unlike all other ghosts, this Big Boo
seems to be susceptible to injury dealt by tangible objects such as blue
throwing blocks. You'll meet up with him in the infamous Donut Secret House,
where he takes three hits to destroy. Once you beat him, you can move on and
never worry about facing him again, because that's the only place where he
appears.

Eerie
-----
These are the ghosts of dead dinosaurs that prefer to inhabit the strange ghost
houses. They move in a variety of ways and numbers. Some move stright forward
while others zig and zag about in a wavy pattern. They can also move like this
in groups of three and five.

Gas Bubble
----------
While these spheres of methane may seem imposing and intimidating, they can be
easily passed by spin jumping on them. While they are impervious to any damage
that might be dealt, you aren't hurt either, so it's the best way to get past
them if ducking and cowering in fear aren't available options.

Fishin' Boo
-----------
Unlike Lakitus sporting fishing rods, these don't have a 1-up on the end, but
rather a hot blue flame that follows you relentlessly. Avoid Fishin' Boos at
all costs.

Boo Blocks
----------
When you face these Boo Buddy variants head-on, they will turn into blocks of
cement. Often you can find them in groups of two or three, meaning that if you
position them just so and then turn to face them, you can often boost yourself
to new areas. Intriguing...

Reflecting stream of Boo Buddies
--------------------------------
Here you find five Boo Buddies in a line, bouncing at 90-degree angles off of
whatever surfaces they happen to hit. They are easily avoided at any altitude.

Circle of Boo Buddies
---------------------
A circle of ghosts that, conveniently enough, contains a hole just to allow you
through when the opportunity comes around. The circle of ghosts can spin both
clockwise and counterclockwise.


G. BOWSER'S MINIONS
===================

Magic Koopa
-----------
This turtlish enemy donning the stereotypical wizard's robe and hat pops up in
the most annoying places and has the ability to fire magic that can turn
ordinary yellow blocks into Koopa Troopas. Even if you get rid of him, he will
appear moments later at another inconvenient juncture, so deal with him as
needed. Magic Koopas are the most easily anger-inducing enemies in the game,
but I can't be held liable if you destroy your Super Nintendo while working
your way around them.

Thwomp
------
Thwomps premiered in SMB3 as large concrete blocks with faces that came
crashing down to the ground when you came too close to them. You could kill
them with a Starman or the Hammer Brother Suit in that game, but here neither
of those are readily available, so you're better off speeding past them.

Thwimp
------
A more infantile version of the classic Thwomp enemy. They don't fall from the
ceiling and crush you, but they do have the ability to jump in a steep arc. Run
under them when they're in the air and you should do just fine.

Dry Bones
---------
These guys are skeletal Koopa Troopas who will come back to life if you jump on
them. Some have the ability to throw a never-ending supply of bones your way,
so duck or jump over those when the opportunity arises. Whacking them with a
spin of your cape can get rid of them forever.

Podoboo
-------
Not only do they pop up out of lava pits as per the usual, they also have the
ability to float around a room bouncing off any walls they hit. They are also
placed in more crafty areas in this game than in games past, so keep your eye
peeled for them.

Ninji
-----
Making a return from SMB2, only the variety that sits still and hops up a few
inches appears here. No walking ones (thank God).

Grinder
-------
These are line-guided chainsaws that move around on the lines provided for
them. If the line they are on has no end and they come to the last of it, they
will fall to the ground and roll along any path they can down there. Jump over
or run under them as necessary.

Mechakoopa
----------
Bop these wind-up nutcases on their heads and then throw them at each other to
kill them. Or, let them walk mindlessly off of the ledge they're on and watch
them fall into the lava like the witless lemmings they're obviously programmed
to be.

Sparky
------
This small ball of electricity can move in a clockwise or counterclockwise path
around castle ledges. You can't really kill electricity, so move around them
when they're on the opposite side of the ledge that you need to cross.

Hothead
-------
A version of Sparky writ large, they move significantly slower than Sparky but
can still move in both directions around a ledge (clockwise or
counterclockwise). It is often better to jump over them than cross under them -
you'll see why ;)

Bowser Statues
--------------
Some Bowser Statues sit still and either blow fire at you or do nothing -
others take on a tan tint and are possessed by some otherworldly force, jumping
at you constantly! Fortunately, there are few incidents in which you have to
worry about these clowns. The silver ones are more easily avoidable than the
tan ones (for obvious reasons).


H. MISCELLANEOUS ENEMIES
========================

Hopping Flames
--------------
Found mainly in the Forest of Illusion, these small licks of flame hop around
and leave small burning fires in their wake. They would be impossible to
destroy were it not for the fact that Yoshi has no problem with becoming a
fire-eater. :)

Monty Mole
----------
This is the smaller cousin of the Mega Moles mentioned earlier in the Cave
Dwellers section. Monty Moles can burrow out of the sides of pass-through
cliffs and the ground itself, and can be disposed of with but one blow to the
head. Monty Moles practically infest some areas and can pester you to an
ungodly degree at times. Make sure you have either Yoshi or a cape to handle
large groups of them.

Fuzzball
--------
You'll mostly find Fuzzballs in places where you find ledges that move along a
guided line. They can inhabit those guided lines or some blocks along which
they scurry in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. If you must come into
contact with one, spin jump on its head so you don't get hurt.

Wiggler
-------
This caterpillar monster is normally quite docile and wants only to walk around
in peace until you pull a jump off its head. At that point, it turns from a
calm yellow to a furious red and will roam around chaotically in an attempt to
bring you down. Either take a long running jump over them, barrel through them
with a Starman handy (they'll give out 2-ups if you have enough points from
invincibility KO's racked up prior), or have Yoshi eat them in one fell swoop.

   Yoshi's Island Walkthrough
   --------------------------

YOSHI'S HOUSE
There is quite literally nothing to do here except read the message Yoshi has
left behind for you in the message box. These blue boxes with a red globe
inside of them can contain hints that are helpful to the fledgling Super Mario
World player and totally useless to the rest of us. Read what he has to say,
then exit on either side of the level and head left on the map to Yoshi's
Island 1.

YOSHI'S ISLAND 1
At the beginning of the level is a naked Koopa Troopa sliding off a hill;
pounce on him or go over him and onto the sloped ledge. Jump off to the right
to get the first Dragon Coin in the game, then either jump on or duck under the
Banzai Bill to your right. The flying question block contains a Mushroom, so
bop it and turn into Super Mario. A very spaced-out Rex trio lies in wait to
your right. Kill all three with normal or spin jumps, then hop across the three
consecutive sloping ledges for the second Dragon Coin. If you run fast enough
right here, another Mushroom will pop out of the bush you just ran past. Grab
it. It will go in a spare box at the top of your screen. If you get hit at any
point, that Mushroom will fall and you can get it to restore your Super Mario
status; or, you can press Select to make it fall at any time you wish. Go past
the jumping Piranha Plant and spin jump on the two yellow blocks that guard
access to the small blue pipe. Enter and navigate the simple cave level here,
spin-jumping the three blocks to get the Dragon Coin. When you exit, you will
be shot out of a pipe facing diagonally to the right. Let the wind carry you to
the level's midway point, indicated by a marker strung across two poles. NOTE:
If you touch this marker as Small Mario, you will instantly become Super Mario.
Otherwise, nothing special happens other than you start at that point if you
die.

Continuing right from the midway marker, you'll see a yellow square made of
dotted lines. When you head to the Yellow Switch Palace in a minute and hit the
big yellow switch, all those yellow dotted lines will be filled in, and all
blocks with yellow exclamation marks will contain Mushrooms.

Hop up the plateaus ahead for a fourth Dragon Coin and slide down the hill by
holding Down to club Rex on the head with your butt. Duck under the Banzai Bill
in the alcove there or jump on him, then kill the Rex behind him and grab the
turtle shell. Hold Y and Up, then release Y. The shell will go up and hit the
turn block, which contains a 1-up. Discard the shell and follow it as it rolls
along the row of Jugem's Clouds above you. Catch it as it falls off the edge or
it will roll in the pit (no yellow switch hit yet, remember?). Along to the
right you'll find a question block suspended above three symmetrically arranged
turn blocks. If you're Super Mario, it will be a Fire Flower, and it will be a
plain old Mushroom if you got hit somewhere along the way. Head farther right
and jump on the ledge to avoid the Banzai Bill, then jump past the airborne
Piranha Plant and get the last Dragon Coin. Bounce off the Clappin' Chuck and
make for the exit.

These kinds of goals are at the end of most levels that aren't castles or
fortresses (most ghost houses have them). A marker moves up and down between
the two striped columns. The higher you hit the marker, the more Bonus Stars
you get. The number of Bonus Stars that you have is represented by the number
next to your spare item box. When you get 100 of them, you will get to play a
bonus game for an opportunity to win up to nine extra lives. You can get
anywhere from 1 to 50 Bonus Stars depending on where the marker is when you hit
it. If you don't hit it at all, you get no Bonus Stars.

=============================================================================
YOSHI'S ISLAND 1 SECRET: HIDDEN 3-UP MOON
You wouldn't expect one to be in the first level, of all places, but, well,
there you are then! Return to the row of Jugem's Clouds where you kick the
empty shell up to get the 1-up when you have a Cape Feather. Soar up to that
cloudy ledge, then run to the left and go up in the air to find a 3-up moon
hidden on a higher row of Jugem's Clouds! Excellent!
=============================================================================

YELLOW SWITCH PALACE
Though this place is technically located on the Donut Plains map, you have to
access it by beating Yoshi's Island. Plus, when you beat it, all the yellow
exclamation point (!) blocks will have Mushrooms in them! Cool!

Hop on the blue P-switch at the beginning and tear your way through the room
grabbing all the possible P-coins that you can. If you're good enough, you can
squeeze two or even three 1-ups out of this room. When the coins disappear,
enter the pipe to the right, run, and pounce on the giant yellow switch to turn
all the yellow dotted-line squares into blocks containing nothing but
Mushrooms. Save your progress when asked and then head back to Yoshi's Island.

YOSHI'S ISLAND 2
Grab the shell to your right and jump up to the ledge near you. When you let
the shell go, it'll kill all eight red Koopa Troopas on the ledge, giving you a
free 1-up. In one of the two question blocks located after that is your first
Yoshi. Eat some of the berries off of the bushes and get the Dragon Coin
located in the middle of the five-coin arc. A small red Koopa will jump into
the empty shell in front of you. If you eat it and spit it out, Yoshi will blow
three fireballs that fan out to cover more air. Use it on the green Koopa
Troopa ahead and get the second of the level's five Dragon Coins. Hop up the
ledge steps and bounce off Chargin' Chuck's head, then jump up to get Dragon
Coin #3. Just ahead is the midway marker; break it and move onward.

If you still have Yoshi, the middle of the trio of question blocks after the
yellow pipes will contain a 1-up. Get that, or the Yoshi if you lost him once
already, and prepare to eat some Monty Moles that pop up out of the cliff sides
and ground ahead. The right one of the two turn blocks has a vine inside of it.
Dismount Yoshi to climb and grab the Dragon Coin found up there. Come back down
and get back on top of him. The fifth and final Dragon Coin is just to the
right; grab it for an easy extra life. Eating the pink berry up ahead will make
Yoshi poop out a cloud that will drop coins with goofy grins on them. Collect
enough of them and you'll add yet another 1-up to your quickly rising number.
If you don't want to play the coin game, go in the blue pipe just in front of
him. Here you can toss some blue throwing blocks up to the flying blocks to get
some coins and still another 1-up, or you can use Yoshi's Midair Dismount (see
the Special Techniques section) to find the one that contains the 1-up if you
run out of throwing blocks. When you exit the cave, hit the turn block located
under the blue P-switch and let yourself hit it. The coins that turn into brown
used blocks will help you reach higher up on the goal in order to get more
Bonus Stars and avoid Chargin' Chuck to boot.

YOSHI'S ISLAND 3
Hop up to each successive plateau and go right to the ledge that swings around
360 degrees when you stand on it. Get the coins just by standing there, then
jump across to the yellow exclamation block, containing (of course) a Mushroom.
You'll now encounter some ledges that expand and contract horizontally. Wait
for them to expand and then jump on them to get the first Dragon Coin of this
stage. Keep on going right, freeing the Yoshi from the question block along the
way, until you come to a very high plateau past two large gray checkered
platforms. Fall off the right edge of that plateau to hit a yellow pipe that
you can enter. Hit the blue P-switch inside and run across the brown blocks for
another Dragon Coin. When you exit, hit the midway marker to secure your
progress thus far.

Just past the midway point is another Dragon Coin followed by a series of five
turn blocks, the last of which contains a coin. Leap up to the next question
block, which contains a Fire Flower that you should be able to get, even if you
were small and passed through the midway marker (that turns you big,
remember?). Go from the gray checkered ledge to the next cliff to the spinning
platform. Six expanding/contracting turn block platforms await you, and half of
them alternate between growing horizontally and vertically. Watch the pattern
until you make it to the end of the line and to another Dragon Coin. Up ahead
is the first of a block you don't see many of in this game: the Star Block. If
you managed to collect 30 coins throughout the course of the level (Dragon
Coins included), you'll get a 1-up from this block. Any fewer, and it just
gives you a normal coin. Ride the two spinning ledges to the natural staircase
and the last Dragon Coin, then hit the bonus tape to net yourself some more
Bonus Stars to go toward your 100-Star bonus game.

YOSHI'S ISLAND 4
If you're small, this level affords you a great opportunity to get back on
track with a yellow exclamation block in front of you and a Fire Flower block
just after that, plus two Dragon Coins right in front of you. Jump across the
orange grassy ledges that sag under your weight until you find a blue pipe.
Enter it to face some Pokeys, an enemy Nintendo fans will remember from SMB2,
the black sheep of the 8-bit trilogy. If you're on Yoshi, eat all five of his
segments, including his head. If you're by yourself, he'll only be three
segments high, and therefore easy to run and jump over. There's a multiple-coin
block of note in here, but that's the only thing really. When you exit through
the shiny blue pipe to the right, go to the left, grab the red shell, and kick
it up to the turn block to make the blue P-switch come down. Get the third
Dragon Coin to your left while you can, then run to the right and jump on the
newly formed brown blocks for the fourth one. From here, the rest of the level
is jumping across floating ledges and avoiding floating spiked balls (i.e. kid
stuff). Go in the pipe at the end and finish out the level with ease.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: YOSHI'S ISLAND 4
At the beginning of the level, with Yoshi, walk to the right of the mushroom
ledge that you start out on. Run to the left, jump, and do a midair dismount.
Yoshi will probably disappear off the left edge of the screen, but you should
no longer be able to see yourself. You're on top of a higher mushroom ledge.
Run to the right and off the ledge, as the four checkpoints are all located in
sequence right next to each other. When you fall off, make sure you find safe
ground, then catch the revealed hidden 1-up as it falls.
=============================================================================

IGGY'S CASTLE #1
For some easy 1-ups, jump right onto the fence and start clubbing Koopa Troopas
with your feet by hitting them on the head as they climb by you. As long as you
stay attached to fences - even if you jump across from fence to fence - your
Koopa Troopa KO's will add up, leaving you in position to score quite a few
extra lives. Ignore the blue P-switch on the floor and stay on the fences all
the way through this room. Touch the midway marker and enter the door. This
next room scrolls very slowly but has a dangerous element - the stone
piston-like smashers that come down from the ceiling. Very few important things
are in this room except for a mushroom in a flying block and a horizontal
expand/contract ledge you need to work your way around. At the end is a huge
red door, which is always your indicator of a major boss just ahead.

This Koopa Kid happens to be Iggy, whose main line of defense is ducking into
his shell and popping a bouncing fireball out at you every now and then. The
ledge he is on teeter-totters back and forth, and jumping on his shell will
make him roll part of the way toward the lava. Use the seesaw motion of the
ledge to your advantage and calculate the times when it is best to jump on him.
When you bop him off the edge of the cliff and into the lava, you'll have
conquered your first castle. Congrats! Now you can move on to the second area,
the Donut Plains.

LEGEND
P# - Refers to the pipe number. Pipes are numbered by the order in which you
     encounter them. There are two of each P#, meaning that they will both
     lead to each other. Unlike in SMB3, entering a pipe does not result in
     an action scene.

*# - Refers to a Warp Star, those places on the map that will warp you to the
     lovely celestial Star Road. To see which star will take you where on the
     Road, just cross-reference the Star Road point and the map that the
     other star is seen on (as with the pipes, there are two of each Warp
     Star number on my maps).

NOTE: The arrows (< and ^) coming from P2 indicate the arrows that actually
      show up on the map once you complete Donut Secret 2.

   Donut Plains Walkthrough
   ------------------------

DONUT PLAINS 1
This level introduces you to Super Koopas and then crams them down your throat
with two different varieties. It's easy to bounce off the yellow ones with no
problem, but the ones with flashing capes will give you a Cape Feather if you
pull a normal jump on them. Jumping on flashing Super Koopas with Yoshi will
kill them without wielding the feather.

In any case, hop off Yoshi if you're on him and go up to the Super Koopa just
ahead. Squeeze a feather out of him. Go back to Yoshi and get the Dragon Coin
that's there that you probably saw, then go forward and clear the Pitchin'
Chuck with a clean running jump. Another flashing Super Koopa lies just beyond
that. Get another feather to keep in your spare item box for security purposes,
then go up to the Volcano Lotus and either eat him or whack him with your cape.
Leap up to the next highest plateau and get the second Dragon Coin. Here you
will find a blue pipe that you can enter. It will lead to a special type of
bonus stage (described in greater detail at the first bracketed-off section
after this level's walkthrough). You can go in and get extra lives, but you
will come out past the midway point if you take it. The choice is yours.

If you go to the bonus stage and come out of the exit, enter the blue pipe
immediately to your left upon exiting the bonus stage. You will get a free
feather and the chance to learn how to fly. Run up the side of the first green
pipe via the purple smiling triangle and jump off when you get to the end of
the pipe tower. To fly, hold Y and press Left and Right in a fluid motion (a
bit faster if you want to go up). There are enough coins in the air here to
provide you with roughly five extra lives, so keep yourself airborne if you
want them all. If you find time lacking or you get all the coins that can
satisfy you, leave through the pipe to the far right of this area. You will
come out of the same pipe that brought you back to this level from the bonus
stage.

Go right, pounce the Super Koopa, and eat the Volcano Lotus. A Yoshi is in the
question block at the top of the cliff. Skip the troublesome Pitchin' Chucks by
going along the floating turn blocks, then go to the Super Koopa column up
ahead. Jump to the top row unless you need a feather, then get the Dragon Coin
next to the pipe. Now, up ahead, there are two different exits you can take.
One will lead you along the Donut Plains' normal course, and the other will
lead to an expansive branching path that is chock full o' secrets. Here's a
rundown of those two exits:

NORMAL EXIT:
From the pipe with the Dragon Coin next to it, just head forward to the exit,
avoiding the Volcano Lotus and the final Pitchin' Chuck (an easy task if you
stand on the yellow exclamation point blocks, which also allows you to reach
higher up on the Bonus Star marker).

KEYHOLE EXIT:
Beginners may want to unlock the green exclamation point blocks first, but
experts should be able to get up there with a Cape Feather and possibly Yoshi
while also using the midair dismount as needed. Either way, the purple triangle
and the soaring high-jump with the cape will allow you to reach some skinny
yellow pipes doubling as platforms. Grab the key and take it to the keyhole to
make it expand and suck you in, effectively taking you to Donut Secret 1.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: DONUT PLAINS 1
At the spot just after the Yoshi block, where you jump across the turn blocks
to avoid the wrath of the Pitchin' Chucks, there is a 1-up located around the
only lone turn block in the path. Jump on top of it to activate the first
checkpoint, then fall off to the left of it and hug the block for #2. You'll
probably land right under it, but that's okay; that's checkpoint #3. Finally,
brush up against the right edge of the turn block to unlock #4 and the 1-up.
=============================================================================
DONUT PLAINS 1 SECRET: HIGH-ALTITUDE COINAGE
If you choose to fly over the entirety of the level, you'll find 91 coins
scattered about in the air and on some rows of Jugem's Clouds (including those
of the Dragon variety). With even just a few coins already in your stock,
that'll net you an extra life, so keep watching the skies!
=============================================================================

DONUT PLAINS 2
This level scrolls very slowly and in addition contains some rising platforms,
so don't get crushed, whether it's on the side of a cave wall or in the
ceiling. The second question block in the row of four has multiple coins in it,
which you really don't have time to mess with, while the one to the right
(actually an exclamation point block) obviously has a Mushroom in it. Wait for
the first bright yellow-orange cliff to rise so you can get Dragon Coin #1,
then watch it sink and move on ahead for a feather and another question blocks
containing multiple coins. Up ahead are many Swooper Bats, many of which will
descend upon you the second they appear on the screen. Whack them with your
cape-twirling finesse until you find an upside-down green pipe located just
past a dotted outline of a green exclamation point block. Go in it.

Get the Mushroom if you've been turned small and make your way past the Puntin'
Chuck, heading over the natural staircase as you do so. You'll see a row of
turn blocks that make a natural progression upward. The last of those blocks
contains a vine, which you'll need to bump if you don't have a Yoshi.
Fortunately, the encased blue shell to the right shall provide for you whether
you have Yoshi or not. If you have him, eat the shell and fly up through the
narrow hole above the block with the vine. Spit out the shell and eat the key,
then touch the keyhole to activate it. Just as a neat little side trick, you
can spit the key out with Y or X while the keyhole is opening and closing. If
you don't have Yoshi, break the turn blocks with a spin jump (which you must be
Super Mario to perform) and grab the shell, then look up and kick it up to the
block with the vine. Climb the vine by climbing the makeshift turn block
staircase in the area.

And, well, if all else fails, exit through the pipe to the far right, which
will take you straight to the level's normal exit.

GREEN SWITCH PALACE
For a little bit of fun here, grab the shell and then hit the P-switch. Go down
through the new hole and either kick the shell down onto the ground yourself or
have the naked blue Koopa Troopa do it. If you follow that shell all the way to
the end of the room (making sure to avoid falling in the pit at the end),
you'll have a 1-up thanks to point multipliers. Cool! Now follow the routine as
usual and hit the giant green switch at the end, which will turn all green
dotted-outline exclamation point blocks into solid green ones containing
nothing but Cape Feathers - possibly the game's most useful item. Save your
game when prompted to make sure you don't lose anything you've gained.

DONUT GHOST HOUSE
Now it's time to mix it up a little by entering one of the game's most illusory
types of levels. There are many places where you can go in this level, but
there are only two proper paths. The first is the easiest to locate so long as
you have a Cape Feather, and possibly a spare in tow if something should happen
to go awry. Walk as far to the right of the wooden block ledge that you start
on as possible, then run to the left and soar upward against the left edge of
the screen. Run along the wooden ceiling to a room that shall reward you with
four 1-ups and a door that leads straight to the level's first exit. When you
beat the level by taking this path, you will gain access to the Top Secret
Area, a safe haven where you can go to get free Yoshis, 1-ups, Mushrooms, Fire
Flowers, and Cape Feathers at will.

For the second exit, go all the way to the right of the initial room, avoiding
the so-called solid Boo Buddies (the translucent ones will not hurt you). Enter
the door and head into the door to the right of the next room as well, since
it's all you can do. You'll end up in what appears to be the same room, but you
now start below the area where you came in the first time. Hit the turn block
and hit the blue P-switch that pops out. Ignore the coins that point you to the
silver door to the left and go in the door to the right that it looks like you
just came through. Those coins are liars! You'll end up in what appears to be
yet again the same room, but rest assured it is not. Hit the turn block to
reveal a vine this time. Jump up through the floor and climb it, taking the
door that it leads you to to the level's other exit.

TOP SECRET AREA
When you take the secret exit out of the Donut Ghost House, you'll reveal this
area. Its basic setup is one screen that allows for side exits (much like
Yoshi's house). You start under the middle of the five question blocks, which
will contain Yoshi if you don't have him and a 1-up if you do. If you are
small, all of the other question blocks contain Mushrooms, and if you are Super
Mario, the two to the left hold Fire Flowers while the two to the right house a
pair of Cape Feathers. Use this place anytime to stockpile some quick lives or
equip yourself with some necessary items. It's here when you need it.

DONUT PLAINS 3
Jump to the gray trio of rotating platforms and up to the mushroom ledge that
will grant you access to a Cape Feather if you've beaten the Green Switch
Palace. Go to the line-guided brown platform and over to the next set of moving
platforms that has a Dragon Coin over it. At the next set of mushroom ledges,
get the two coins from the question blocks and crunch the destructible turn
blocks. One of them can't be spin-jumped because it has a vine in it. When you
get below where the turn blocks are, hit the second turn block from the right
to reveal the vine that will take you up to a Dragon Coin. When you fall off
the Jugem's Cloud platform, you'll face a challenge you haven't seen before
now: line-guided ledges whose paths YOU determine. Allow me to explain.

Jump on the platform moving in the octagonal pattern. It will continue to move
in that path without some divine Mario intervention. Hit the fuchsia ON block
to turn it to a light-blue OFF block. One of the lines in the octagon will
change direction, meeting with the lower path that will take you farther.
You'll see another OFF block leading to what appears to be a bottomless pit.
Unless you're a very sadistic gamer, you don't want to fall in that pit, so hit
the OFF block to turn all the others ON again. Done correctly, you'll find
another Dragon Coin and the midway point.

Go past the line ledge shared by the Fuzzball and the set of turning ledges
with a question block as its center (it's got a feather in it, if you're
feelin' lucky) to the line-guided ledge. Trust the ledge - as it falls off of
one line, it will reflexively hop to the next one. Stay on until you pass the
third one, after which you have a pipe to jump to that will lead to a bonus
stage. You'll come out in front of an octagonal line with no ledge and a
Fuzzball on it. Avoid him stealthily by hopping across the triple rotating
ledge. If you got thirty coins over the course of the level, you can get a 1-up
from the Star Block at the end. Jump from the brown platform to the marker to
finish out the level.

DONUT PLAINS 4
As soon as the level starts, run up and hold Y. You'll grab a shell and knock
out the small naked Koopa Troopa that was about to jump in it. This prevents a
nasty situation; if any shell-less Koopa finds a yellow shell and jumps in it,
that shell is invincible to all of Mario's attacks, including jumping on it,
fireballing it, and twirling your cape to turn it over. On the plus side,
Yoshis can eat them, and will gain all three special abilities at the same time
if they do (that is, they'll be able to fly _and_ stomp the ground really hard,
and when they spit it out it will come out as fireballs).

Anyway, hop up to the plateau and get the first of the five Dragon Coins, then
go forward past the growing and shrinking pipe to the Hammer Brother. Destroy
him by knocking his flying ledge from below with your head, or pass him and run
up the cliffside using the purple triangle nestled in the corner. Head for the
blue pipe with the Dragon Coin set just in front of it and duck into it when
the Piranha Plant is out of your way. Get the Dragon Coin with the help of the
line of red Koopas and exit through the pipe to the right, which will blast you
out diagonally over the Hammer Brother and right into the midway point.

The first question block after the midway marker contains a Yoshi - an
invaluable asset to continuing through this area. Just after that, in a dip
with two winged Goombas, is yet another Dragon Coin. Get it and find the
tramsparent block ahead, waiting until it changes to a star to get it so you
can barrel ahead through the wave of parachuting Goombas ahead. Rush along the
flat slopes to the end of the level, where the end goal is located past a
fairly long pit with a Hammer Brother cruising over it. Bump him off of his
safe ledge and use it as a means of getting more Bonus Stars.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: DONUT PLAINS 4
At the part with the first Hammer Brother (where you also see the purple
triangle up against the wall), run up the triangle with a cape equipped.
Abandon Yoshi if you have him to do it, of course, and rush up the wall,
jumping when you get to the top to hoist yourself to a row of Jugem's Clouds.
At the end is a seemingly lonely cement block. Cross under it to unlock the
first checkpoint, then jump and hug the right side of the block to get #2.
Checkpoint #3 is on top of the block, and the fourth and final one is up
against the left side of it.
=============================================================================
DONUT PLAINS 4 SECRET: ANOTHER 3-UP MOON
After the transparent block on the flat-topped slopes where the Goombas keep
parachuting, fly around up in the air to find a sort of Jugem's Cloud pedestal
with a 3-up Moon perched on it.
=============================================================================

DONUT SECRET 1
Now that the normal levels are out of the way, you can go back and cover the
ones that need to be unlocked via key and keyhole. This is the first of those,
and you must take the keyhole exit from Donut Plains 1 in order to access it.
You'll come out of a pipe into a very watery area. Swim past the slumbering Rip
Van Fish if you're ill-equipped to face him; otherwise, shoot a fireball his
way or smack him with a 360 from your cape. Swim all the way to a blue pipe
with the end facing down and go in to access a cavernous area with a very high
ceiling. Use the P-balloon in the question block to inflate Mario to a height
sufficient for him to float up in the air and hold Up to make him gain
altitude. Along the way, if you veer to the left, you'll find another balloon,
which you should get because that trip to the top isn't possible with one
balloon. At the top are two turn blocks. The one on the left contains nothing,
whereas the one on the right has a 1-up in it. There are also two Dragon Coins
and a Fire Flower to pick up while you are in here.

You'll come out of an orange pipe with another Dragon Coin nearby. Grab it and
stroke onward, getting the Dragon Coin encased in blue throw blocks if you can.
Shortly following that is a blue P-switch that you should pick up if you intend
to exit the level both ways. Notice that your control over yourself is a bit
wonky when you grab the P-switch, so swerve around enemies as necessary until
you come to a row of five brown blocks capped off by a question block. Drop the
blue P-switch and hit it so you can open the question block, which reveals the
key you need to access the Donut Secret House. Your handling is of the same
awkwardness with the key as it is with the P-switch, so get a grip on it and
steer Mario to the keyhole to get to the secret exit. The normal exit is not
far ahead of that for when you come to this level again to beat it the other
way, and the only thing that might trouble you is the Rip Van Fish lazing about
in front of the arrow sign. The normal exit will take you to the original Donut
Ghost House.

DONUT SECRET HOUSE
Go up the stairs and wait for the circle of Boo Buddies to turn its hole toward
you so you can pass through. Make it through and hit the blue P-switch ahead to
cause a portable springboard to fall from the brown block. Use the springboard
to bound over the Big Boo blocking you. Run up the next two flights of stairs
to the door and enter it. The question block to the left hides a flower, which
is really of little use here, so ignore it you have something better like a
Cape Feather. Wait on the gap in the next Boo Buddy circle and clear out the
formation of five coins that looks somewhat like the outline of a door (hmm...)
before heading all the way to the left side of the room. There is a P-switch
over there. Carry it over here. There are two constructive things you can do
once you hit it, both of which are conducive to finding a way out of here.

The first is to hit it and enter the silver door that appears on the wooden
pedestal, which you can only get to if you got that five coins out of the
picture like I said earlier. It will lead to the normal goal marker exit, which
will take you to a pipe on the overworld map leading to a secluded corner of
the Valley of Bowser containing the Donut Secret 2 level.

The other exit, which is more important in the big scheme of things, can be
found just to the left of the silver door. You'll notice some new question
blocks and a door that appears between the turn blocks. Do not go in that door,
but rather hit the turn block above it to reveal a vine that leads up to
another silver door. When you go in that door, you will encounter a boss that
you will see here and in no other levels. It's a Big Boo, and it's somehow
susceptible to tangible objects where other non-corporeal enemies are not.
Fortunately, with a floor coated in nothing but throwing blocks, it's pretty
hard to lose this battle unless you make a hole through to the bottom of the
floor. When he appears, take a throwing block and hold Up and Y to aim up at
him, then kick it and hope it clocks him right in his ugly mug. If it does,
he'll fade into the background for a moment and move to another place before
re-appearing. Knock him in the face with a blue block each time he materializes
in a new spot. With only three hits to his name, it shouldn't take long to
bring him down for the count. When you beat the level, you'll reveal one of
five Warp Stars located in all of Dinosaur Land, which will transport you
immediately to the Star Road if you press A, B, Y, or X while standing on one.

P.S. Watch out for the small Boo Buddy lackeys tagging along with the Big Boo
Boss - they're more of a nuisance than he is.

DONUT SECRET 2
There's no point in getting the directional coins out of the block on the
ground at the beginning. Hop up the icy plateaus to get the first Dragon Coin,
then use the springboard to get the vine out of the turn block and climb up to
the turn block with the Starman in it. With that spurt of temporary
invincibility, run as fast as you can and barrel through the Spike Tops
piddling along all surfaces. Go as far as you can with the Starman in two, then
find a very long upside-down green pipe. Jump up into it and get the P-balloon,
controlling Mario to get the coins scattered about in the sky until you're at
the blue pipe to the far right. There's another Starman inside the turn block
in front of you, which should last long enough for you to get to the goal and
nab a 1-up in the process.

MORTON JR'S CASTLE #2
Avoid the Thwimps at the beginning by jumping over them during their momentary
groundedness. Run up the escalator to the door while evading the swinging
balls-and-chains along your ascent. There's a Mushroom in a yellow exclamation
block if you need it. Go in the door and make your way up and to the left,
waiting on the Thwomps to rise before moving past them (no way you're going to
crash past one of those things!).

The final room of Morton Jr's castle is slow goings - you have to make your way
up past a bunch of blocks that come out of and sink back into the wall. The
first point of note is a row of three question blocks, the middle of which
contains a feather if you're Super Mario. Shortly after that, you'll see a
portable springboard that takes you to both a dead-end with a 3x4 block of
coins and a row of turn blocks, depending on where you bounce up to. In the row
of five turn blocks you find in the left fork of the path, hit the second one
from the right to reveal a vine that will take you up to a hidden 1-up (it's in
an invisible block guarded by a Dry Bones). Once you get it, head back down and
resume your ascent to the top, where you'll find a Cape Feather before the Big
Red Mean-Looking Door(tm).

When you enter, the walls will come crashing down on either side of you,
leaving you to face the single-horned Morton Jr. If you fail to hit him on the
head, he'll walk up the wall like some kind of evolved Spike Top and go to the
ceiling, where he'll attempt to crash down on you once he gets directly over
you. Run away and jump before the moment of impact so that you don't get
frozen, then hit him on the head. This will incite some sort of weird motion in
his body, as if a belt has just been quickly tightened to its maximum hold
around his stomach. However, he's so moronic that you should be able to bounce
on his head the required three times before he can even get up the wall one
time. When you defeat him, his body will expand, contract, flop around, and
eventually disappear into the infinity of time and space, and you'll have
another castle under your belt. Now you'll find yourself in the vast Vanilla
Dome.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: MORTON JR'S CASTLE #2
Across from where the hidden 1-up is in the room with the ledges that move in
and out from the wall (in the only real tight squeeze of that room, with the
cement blocks that you stand on), jump out of the narrow top to meet a Dry
Bones on the jutting platform to the right. Get him out of the picture, then
run all the way up against the wall. Seeing as how the checkpoints are in
sequence, you'll uncover a 1-up once you find yourself pressed up against the
right wall.
=============================================================================
MORTON JR'S CASTLE #2 SECRET: A VERY-WELL HIDDEN BONUS ROOM
This is kind of hard to do, what with the Thwimps in your way at the beginning,
but to make it easier, head all the way to the top of the first room, but don't
go in the door. Instead, run all the way to the bottom and jump when you're
back at the start. Veer right to hit a ledge that starts off a short path to a
pipe hidden up in this "attic" sort of space. Inside is one of those bonus
rooms where you hit the question blocks in the correct sequence for 1-ups. When
you leave the bonus room, you'll get taken directly to the aforementioned room
with the invisible 1-up checkpoints.
=============================================================================

IF I MAY INTERRUPT FOR A SECOND.....
------------------------------------
It's safe to assume you've gotten at least 100 Bonus Stars by this point, so if
you're not sure how the bonus game works, here's a quick explanation. In the
middle of the 3x3 spinning block game, there is a block with a certain power-up
imprinted on it - either a Mushroom, a Fire Flower, or a Starman. The point is
to hit the other eight blocks so that the item on them matches the one in the
center. The more matching rows you can create, the more extra men you'll get.
The easiest way to make them all match is to jump in a sort of rhythm, tapping
B to get the motion down to make them all appear the same. At the end, if you
have one matching row of icons, you'll get one extra life; if you have two,
then two 1-ups; three, three; and if you match all the symbols perfectly,
you'll net a whopping nine extra lives. How's that for a bonus?

   Vanilla Dome Walkthrough
   ------------------------

VANILLA DOME 1
Head down the steps and watch out for both the Swooper Bats on the ceiling and
the lone Spike Top on the ground. In the middle of all the Swooper Bat
miscellany is a flying question block that contains a Mushroom should you
happen to be small. At the turn block fortress up ahead, take the bottom row
the whole way, whacking Buzzy Beetles with a Cape Feather as necessary, or
taking the first one, hitting him, and using his shell to eradicate the others.
There's an invisible mushroom that will pop out from behind the small platform
behind you near the turn blocks at the end. Jump out through the top and head
right. You'll see some red outlines of blocks. Once you find the Red Switch
Palace (located in the Vanilla Dome, incidentally), you'll be able to get up to
the keyhole exit that they lead to a bit easier, but you can do it now if you
have Yoshi - use the midair dismount trick to hit the turn block with the vine
in it, and do it again to get to that vine. You'll have to leave Yoshi behind
to do it, sadly, but we must all make sacrifices in the quest to beat all 96
levels.

If you can't get to the keyhole exit at this time due to extenuating
circumstances, then keep on truckin' to the pipe up against the wall that you
have to go in. Get the Starman provided and haul butt across that yellow-orange
rock before it plunges all the way into the lava. A Dragon Coin awaits you at
the end if you make it successfully. When you come out of the pipe, hop across
to the midway marker to secure your progress through this level. Hit the turn
blocks and navigate the sort of miniature maze going on here. You have to be
small to get the Dragon Coin in the barely accessible chamber at the top, so if
you really want it that bad, you should sacrifice an item by voluntarily
hitting a Buzzy Beetle or Spike Top. Go across the pipes when the maze expands
into open air (so to speak) for a moment and head up the steep slope to get
back into another maze, which is just as easy to get through as the last one
was. The blue shell is your indicator that you're on the home stretch; if you
take it to the exit and hold it when you hit the goal marker, it'll turn into a
1-up! Sweetness! Other shells turn into various power-ups if taken through a
goal marker, such as Mushrooms and Fire Flowers.

VANILLA DOME 2
Take the big plunge into the still water and hop out, kicking the floundering
fish to kill it with ease. Jump over the Buzzy Beetle and get the second of the
four question blocks just over the next pond to reveal a flower - a very useful
acquisition here. Swim around to the next open area and get the vine out of the
turn block. You'll have to ditch Yoshi if you have him at this point in order
to get up the vine. Go across to the right and drop where you see the
coin-formed down arrow with a Dragon Coin serving as the tip of it. There's a
feather in the third question block down here and a hidden 1-up to the far left
against the wall under the large brown-block area. Swim to the question block
opposite the very steep incline. Jump onto the hill and over to the left; keep
going left until you see a P-switch. Carry it as far left as you can and hit,
jumping across to the left of where the Dragon Coin-tipped arrow used to be.
There are now coins where once the brown blocks were. The key is on dry land to
the left of a Dragon Coin that doesn't matter very much. Take it down into the
water and steer your way to the keyhole to find the exit that will lead to the
Red Switch Palace.

If you want or need to take the normal exit, keep going up that aforementioned
steep incline to a row of turn blocks. Don't worry about them too much; before
long, a Chargin' Chuck will plow his way through them. Pounce his head and move
quickly past him to the midway marker. Let another Chargin' Chuck tunnel
through more turn blocks for you and get a Starman out of the transparent block
ahead if you can. Cruise down the hill and hit the blue P-switch without
picking it up. Being invincible should give you time to get to the green pipe
(which you can go in) with minimal friction. This leads to an icy sub-level
with a multiple coin block - the only thing of note. Coming out of the subzero
mini-area, you'll be in the middle of a horde of Swooper Bats with a Splittin'
Chuck at the end of them to cause more trouble. Head past them all to the
normal exit.

RED SWITCH PALACE
Jump on the P-switch immediately, then jump over the invincible Koopa Troopa
shell. If you stay along the top row of brown blocks and move all the way to
the right, following it as it goes, you can get a 1-up from the point
multipliers the moving shell creates. When you have the 1-up, go in the pipe
and hit the switch to turn the red outlines into red exclamation point blocks.
These do not have items in them, but rather can be used as ledges and stepping
stones at certain points in the game. Once you're on the map, save your game
and beat Vanilla Secret 1 the keyhole way if you haven't already.

VANILLA GHOST HOUSE
Duck under the bottom of the two Eeries and wait for the circle of Boo Buddies
to open up to you. Go for the flower in the top block if you're mostly
defenseless, and opt for the Dragon Coin if you have a flower or feather
equipped. Hop across the series of platforms of varying height until you find a
second Dragon Coin. Ahead are two rows of turn blocks separated by very narrow
holes. On the bottom row in the second section of turn blocks, hit the third
one from the left to reveal a vine. Climb it after dodging Big Boo to skip a
whole lot of messy traps down below. When you fall to the ground, you'll be at
the door to the next room. Go back and get the Dragon Coin in the circle of Boo
Buddies if you're going for all five of them, then head into the door. The
green gas bubbles in here are not easily hurdled, so keep yourself from being
damaged by spin-jumping them. They won't pop or anything, but you won't get
hurt, and that's the main thing. Find an arrangement of three turn blocks and
hit the middle one to reveal a blue P-switch. Take it all the way to the right,
getting all the coins in the door formation before dropping it and hitting it.
Enter the new silver door to reveal the exit.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: VANILLA GHOST HOUSE
After the first Dragon Coin there is a series of platforms of varying heights
in front of you. Along these platforms are located all the checkpoints you need
to get the 1-up. The first of these is on the tall one right next to the first
short one. Drop immediately down to find the second one. Hop up to the next two
platforms that get successively taller and jump to the next tallest one to the
right, upon which you'll find the third one. Finally, backtrack to the shorter
one below you and to your left to reveal checkpoint #4. As there are several
Boo Buddies surrounding you as you try to get this one, it is advisable to not
go for this one unless you REALLY need it.
=============================================================================

VANILLA DOME 3
Jump onto the skull raft to get it moving and jump over the Blargg as he
surfaces from the lava - you should be able to notice his eyes peeking out
before he jumps up. Two flying blocks will cross your path, and the top one
contains a 1-up. It's tough to get, so you might as well skip it as you head
for the pipes that form a sort of staircase. Slide down the steep slope, get
the Dragon Coin, and board the skull raft in one fell swoop. Ride across the
river of lava to dry land. Hug the orange pipe and jump to reveal an invisible
coin block that will help you over it. There's a feather in the opposite
question block - grab it and move on to the next skull raft. Up ahead are
several upside-down classic Piranha Plants - cape-whack or fireball them on
your way to a yellow pipe that you can go in. There's nothing of importance
inside - just go on ahead to the purple triangle and hop down in the hole to
get the midway marker, risky as it is. There is a Yoshi in the block directly
above the midway marker, so you may want to risk testing the water, so to
speak, if only to get him.

Pass the red shell and board another skull raft that will take you up some
gravity-defying lava hills. At the big flat drop-off, hop to the square rock
and wait a minute before getting the Dragon Coin (easiest if you have a feather
because you float down to the raft without having to guess where you're
landing). Move through the Spike Top brigade with care and get the next Dragon
Coin located just before a question block with a feather in it. The feather is
a sign that there might be something above you, and there is: the final Dragon
Coin. Hop over each individually placed black Piranha Plant and hit the
P-switch to reveal a downward staircase of coins that will put you in good
position to get a whole lot of Bonus Stars from the goal marker.

=============================================================================
VANILLA DOME 3 SECRETS: ANOTHER 3-UP MOON AND A NEARBY BONUS STAGE
Where you find the invisible coin block right beside the orange pipe, run to
the left and jump if you have a feather. You'll soar up to a tunnel that has a
3-up Moon on a cement pedestal at the end. From there, run to the right and fly
to another ledge directly across from where the 3-up Moon was. After you dip
your way through a sort of naturally carved half-pipe, you'll come to a green
pipe that leads to one of those 1-up block bonus stages. The exit will put you
right near the midway point for your convenience.
=============================================================================

VANILLA DOME 4
Immediately down and to your right is the first Dragon Coin in this ironic
level (in that it appears to be outdoors but Vanilla Dome takes place inside
... ahh, whatever). Springboard upward to the top of the polka-dotted column
and go right. If you need a quick power-up, there's a Mushroom at the bottom of
the next two pea-springboards. Keep moving, getting the next Dragon Coin and
the feather along the way, until you find the high-up midway point. Hit the
marker and prepare for a Bullet Bill assault as you advance forward. The
onslaught won't last long - you can go in the blue pipe with the jumping
Piranha Plant in it that takes you to a lengthy skull raft cave, at the end of
which is another Dragon Coin. When you come out, the Bullet Bills return in
full force, shooting at you from all four sides of the screen simultaneously.
Fortunately, the attack doesn't last too much longer, and before you know it
you'll have completed another level.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: VANILLA DOME 4
There's another block in this level that the checkpoints are all centered
around. In this case, it's the brown block below the feather (just after the
second Dragon Coin). Do a counterclockwise 360 around the block starting at the
bottom to make this extra life pop up for you.
=============================================================================

VANILLA SECRET 1
On the other side of the Dome you'll find this new batch of levels entirely.
It'll take you in another direction with some more variety, but you will end up
at the same point eventually (Ludwig's castle). As with the Vanilla Dome
itself, there are two sides of the path you can take on the way up through this
level, but the right side is the one you need to take to get somewhere in a
hurry. Take the left side first if you need a feather, though - there's one in
the second of the two question blocks opposite the pea-like springboards. In
the middle of the three turn blocks above the pipe is a vine; climb it, making
sure to grab the springboard at the top. The idea, in order to get the secret
exit anyway, is to take it to the left and place it on the blue exclamation
blocks (which aren't there yet because you haven't had a chance to explore the
Forest of Illusion thus far). You can still get to the secret exit with a
feather, however - just get a running start on the ledge to the left of the
vine if you have a feather and soar up to the pipe. Go past the Puntin' Chuck
and get to the goal marker to unlock the Warp Star to the left of this level
that is blocked by the rocks on the map. You should be able to get straight to
Star Road 2 upon taking this exit - a handy level if you need a Yoshi that can
fly stat.

Moving farther up from the springboard to get to the normal exit requires
leaving the springboard in its original spot and taking a boosted jump off of
it when there's a clear spot between the flying Koopa Troopa brigade and the
hole up there. Use the next springboard to get the two Dragon Coins in the big
empty expanse above (which only matter if you've gotten the others). Take the
boingy wall springboards to the left up to the pipe, which leads to a variation
on the other room with the Puntin' Chuck. Pass him and hit the goal marker to
close out the level.

VANILLA SECRET 2
In the first question block you'll find Yoshi. Use him to get through the
almost-never-ending horde of green bouncy Koopa Troopas and get the Cape
Feather from the grounded green block along the way. After you clear them,
you'll be right in front of the level's midway point. Bob-ombs will start to
parachute out of the sky once you get a little bit farther ahead. Avoid them
and the Spinys on the hillside. Jump through the blocks to get a Dragon Coin
and get the silver P-switch from the second turn block in the row of four. Hit
it to turn the Spinys into silver coins - enough to give you a 1-up, as a
matter of fact. Go in the green pipe with the Lakitu inside and hit the blue
P-switch for buku coins. When you come out, you'll be shot out of the
diagonally positioned pipe on top of a couple of red Koopa-Troopas, or at least
enough to get you to the exit anyhow.

VANILLA SECRET 3
Do the Vanilla Secrets ever end? Fortunately, they do with this watery level,
and this one is an easy one if ever there was one. Basically you want to stay
on top of the snorkel-clad dolphins the whole way through. Get the feather on
the tall mushroom ledge near the beginning of the level, then board the
dolphins and let them carry you to the right. A little bit short of the midway
marker, you'll start being harassed by a Porcu-Puffer. He's not a problem if
you stay on the dolphins. Once you find the large arrows formed by the masses
of coins, you'll know you're at the end of the level. Go in the pipe and hit
the goal tape to finish this one out.

VANILLA FORTRESS
When you come out of the pipe and into the water, you'll be faced mainly with
balls-and-chains and Fishbones, annoying little skeletal enemies that swim
straight toward you, and often in the most inconvenient positions. Shortly into
the level you'll notice a pipe that you have to be small to get to. All it
leads to is one of those goofy bonus stages, and you end up in the same place
anyway, so it isn't really worth it at all. Swim onward to the blue pipe at the
very end, getting the feather along the way so that you have some form of
defense against the Dry Bones and Bony Beetles in the falling spike area. Once
out of the blue pipe, you'll be put in the middle of a mass of aquatic foes
plus some Thwomps. Swim to the big red door, before which you'll notice a
yellow exclamation block. Get it if you need that or you just want a spare
power-up and don't have one.

Inside the Big Mean-Looking Red Door(tm) is Reznor, the boss you'll face in
every level with the word "Fortress" in its name. Reznor consists of four
fire-breathing dinos on a rotating platform. Hit each one from under to knock
it out. When you have two of the four - half of them, in other words -
eliminated, the bridge below you will start to crumble away. Destroy the other
two as fast as you can, moving to the rotating ledge if the bridge becomes too
precarious to stand on. When you beat Reznor, you'll go on to the Butter Bridge
and be asked to save your progress so far. Of course, you want to say Yes - why
wouldn't you?

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: VANILLA FORTRESS
This is a really tough one to get, so don't go for it unless you have one life
left and you're the daredevil sort that can get away with anything. Just before
the Big Mean-Looking Red Door(tm), you'll notice two balls-and-chains swinging
around. The upper left one of the two has a 1-up waiting around its center
block. Swim a counterclockwise 360 around it starting from the bottom of the
block to uncover it. Make sure to hug all sides of the block as you go around;
for this reason, it's easiest to get this one as Small Mario, of all types.
=============================================================================

LEMMY'S CASTLE #3
Once you've beaten all the Vanilla Dome has to offer, come back around to this
castle and finish out the Dome with style. This is by far the most annoying
castle yet, as you have to start out facing the omnipresent Magikoopas. Their
magic can transform turn blocks into yellow Koopa Troopas. Instead of
spin-jumping the turn blocks and eliminating the middle man (not a good idea at
all, trust me), wait for Magikoopa to appear at the bottom and shoot his magic
up at you. Fall through the hole that forms and trudge forward, killing
Magikoopa at any available opportunity to stave off his constant attacks for
awhile. When you come to the turn blocks over the water, find a blue P-switch
and hit it the minute you see it. Continue forward to a door that's on top of
some brown blocks. It won't be there for long, according to the timer. Go in
before the time runs out and you'll find yourself at the midway point rewarded
with a 1-up for your timeliness as well.

Upon exiting the solitary midway marker room, you'll find yourself in a room
where ledges rise out of and sink into the lava. All this requires is decent
timing and a way around the many Dry Bones that infest the area. Watch the
movement of the rocks and get as many power-ups along the way as you can, such
as the Mushroom sitting right out in the open in a tiny corner and the green
exclamation point block at the end of the line.

In the boss room, you'll fight Lemmy, who as you recall rolled along on a beach
ball shooting them from his wand in SMB3. Here, he's nothing but a pipe dream.
However, you'll soon be asking yourself, "Will the real Lemmy please stand up?"
Three different Lemmys will pop out of the unevenly arranged pipes. One is the
real one; the other two are decoys. If you hit the correct one, you'll be met
with a reassuring chime. Any other Lemmys hit will result in a dull "thud"
noise. When you hit the real deal three times, he'll plummet into the lava,
never to bother you again. You'll move on to a short series of miscellaneous
levels before entering the Forest of Illusion. Make sure you complete them all,
because there are secrets aplenty crammed in them.

LEGEND
BB - Stands for Butter Bridge. Again, it's a space saver.

   Intermediate Levels Walkthrough
   -------------------------------

BUTTER BRIDGE 1
This level will scroll all the way through, so you'll have to be one step ahead
of the screen's inexorable movement at all times. When you jump to the parallel
mushroom columns, notice that the one you're on sinks and the other rises
accordingly. You'll have to use these ledges to your advantage to get through.
Just jump across the first two pairs of them to the gray platform that falls
under your weight, and get the Dragon Coin if you're in the mood. Use the next
red flying Koopa-Troopa to give yourself some momentum to the floating log
bridge. If you've beaten the Red Switch Palace (which you should have by now),
they will be here to help you get to the log bridge, although jumping from
green Koopa to green Koopa is actually easier and can net you a 1-up thanks to
point multipliers if you hit them all. The mushroom column pairs get
increasingly taller at this point. Jump to the one on the right in the third
pair (i.e. the sixth one) and let it sink as the screen scrolling takes a
downward turn. The screen will scroll up again at the four rows of turn blocks,
which all have one multiple coin block hidden somewhere within them. In
addition, the one at the top holds a 1-up in the second block from the left.
Grab it if you have time to before the screen starts heading right again. From
here, make your way slowly down and to the right, moving in time with the
screen, until you get to the blue pipe leading to the exit.

BUTTER BRIDGE 2
The second half of the Butter Bridge will go a bit easier on you by not
scrolling, but it is packed to the hilt with Super Koopas. Knock the first one
that comes running at you in the head with a normal jump to squeeze a feather.
Use the green shell up ahead to get the feather out of the high-up block if you
need a spare one for the old item box. Watch out for the Koopas that kick the
red and blue shells at you - it takes some crafty jumping around to avoid this
heavy arsenal. Thankfully, the midway point is located just after them, so hit
it and proceed as normal.

Go forward, obtaining the Cape Feather from the green block, and go in the
second blue pipe you find. You'll go to a fun sub-level where you climb up and
down a line-guided rope in order to get a few normal coins and a Dragon Coin.
You'll come out of a green pipe once you return to the level only to find
yourself swarmed by Super Koopas with red capes (they don't flash, so no Cape
Feathers). From here it's not a far trip to the exit.

CHEESE BRIDGE AREA
You'll start out this level, located on the bridge under the Butter Bridge, by
finding a Cape Feather in a question block. Ride the ledges on the lines. To
save yourself some hassle, ride along just the top one. You'll give yourself a
headache hopping from one to the other trying to get all the Dragon Coins, even
if you're fanatic about collecting them. Riding the top one also allows you to
reach the midway point easier, but you can jump on top of the nearby question
block to get to it also. The question block under the midway point contains the
elusive Yoshi's Wings. If you have Yoshi, consider this the normal exit; if
not, just keep moving.

Climbing along the ropes is not an easy task what with the chainsaws in your
way. If you're going solo on the ropes, you can avoid taking a hit by
spin-jumping them as you did the green gas bubbles in the Vanilla Ghost House.
The part before the exit is crammed chock full of chainsaws, so climb up and
down as needed or fly by with Yoshi and a Cape Feather and avoid getting hit by
normal-jumping on them with Yoshi.

At the end of the level, you'll be on the two mushroom ledges facing the goal
marker. If you go ahead and touch that goal marker, you'll go on the normal
path to Cookie Mountain, but you'll see an arrow sign pointing onward still as
the screen irises in and goes back to the overworld map. What could possibly be
beyond a level exit? Another exit, that's what. You can't get to it by going
over it; this is where you need to have completely mastered the midair dismount
by now. With Yoshi as your noble steed and a cape on your back, float _under_
the exit (make sure it's at running speed so your angle of floating is more
acute) and press A while holding the buttons necessary to make your descent
slower. If all goes well, you should find a 3-up Moon as your reward sitting
right in front of the second secret goal post. It will lead you right on down a
new vine that goes to......

SODA LAKE
The main thing about this level is all the Torpedo Teds. They're like Bullet
Bill machines that don't wait a little bit to fire one at you; the hand keeps
going in and coming out with more and more of them. Get the flower at the
beginning; it will be useful when you have to maneuver around the swimming
snorkeled fish as well as Torpedo Ted. The level is pretty much nothing but
evading these underwater missiles and fish that swim mindlessly swim forward.
If you survive, you'll be taken to the Warp Star that leads directly to Star
Road 3, the shortest of all the levels in the game. Remember that the Fire
Flower will aid you more than other item in this level possibly can and you'll
do great.

COOKIE MOUNTAIN
Jump on the sliding Koopa Troopa when he shoots off the ramp and skids to a
halt right in front of you. You'll soon have your first encounter with a Sumo
Brother, a fat guy who can stomp the ground and make lightning appear below
himself. Knock him out from beneath him and jump up to where he was, getting
the feather out of the question block. There are several slanted ledges here,
and many sliding Koopas to go with that. Grab the red shell tucked away in the
corner and save it for when you get over the wall. Kill all the Monty Moles
that pop out of the sides of the small cliffs. You should get a 1-up from point
multipliers if you're lucky. Move forward until you get to the midway point
near the short green pipe.

Just following the midway point, there is a large plateau beside you that many
a Monty Mole will come out of. Go in the blue pipe past that plateau once
you're away from the Monty Mole infestation. You'll find yourself in an area
with a strong river current and a couple of Porcu-Puffers, but nothing to whine
and cry about if you're fast with the controller. Move left to the exit pipe
and enter, then run across the Jugem's Cloud row to get a nice surprise (see
the bracketed section after the walkthrough for this level) and fly across to
the top of the very big plateau that had about five Monty Moles hidden in it.
There is a 1-up in the single turn block up there. When you've obtained it,
float back down to earth. If you have Yoshi, eat the pink berries up ahead to
play the coin cloud game and eat whatever prize you want from the grounded
transparent block with the changing items inside. Kill the Sumo Brothers on the
rows of coin blocks and move forward to get Bouncin' Chuck out of the way. The
exit is just past the tall blue pipe.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: COOKIE MOUNTAIN
Even if you're not looking for 1-up checkpoints, this one is the one a novice
is most likely to find by accident. It's very easy to access. As mentioned in
the paragraph prior to this bracketed section, enter the pipe leading to the
mini-level with two Porcu-Puffers hounding you. Exit the other side and jump to
the Jugem's Cloud row, running straight ahead until a 1-up Mushroom pops out at
you. And there's one just across from you to boot! Man, life is good.
=============================================================================

LUDWIG VON KOOPA'S CASTLE #4
The tunnel at the beginning of this castle, despite having an awesome
background, is a bit hard to navigate as Super Mario or any of his other forms
(Fire Mario, Cape Mario, etc.). Mostly it's getting by the balls-and-chains
that's such a chore. If you happen to get smallified, however, there's a
Mushroom at the end of the corridor to help you out. Grab it if you need it now
or as a spare item. The next room has you outrunning an evil falling ceiling.
Run as fast as you can without getting hit by the fireballs jumping high out of
the lava to the pink ON block. Hit it to turn it OFF and make it go back up.
The rise of the ceiling is only temporary - it will start falling again once it
reaches the top. At that point, you know it's time to run. Make it to the door
all the way to the left by doing nothing but dashing and go in.

The final room before Ludwig's lair is a fence room much like the one from
Iggy's castle (the first one - was it really that long ago?), except it's
vertically oriented. Make your way to the top and kill as many of the Koopa
Troopas climbing along with you as you can to stock up on bunches of extra
lives. The first side path to the right leads you to an isolated Cape Feather
if you need it. Get it before clocking any turtles so you can still get all the
1-ups you're fit to hold. At the very top is, as always, that Big Mean-Looking
Red Door(tm).

Ludwig von Koopa is the most unique of the Koopa Kids in his approach to
fighting you. He'll shoot four fireballs before speeding at you inside his
shell, and then he'll jump in a very wide arc to another point on the screen.
Jump on him while he's firing his heated breath to start the speeding of the
shell instantly and have him follow you near the middle of the room to keep him
from jumping off to the side where you can't reach him. Three hits are all it
takes as per the usual to defeat Ludwig. That's a shame, because he's the most
fun to fight. His post-defeat cinema is also the most entertaining to watch as
well. When you defeat him, save your game and head with great trepidation into
the Forest of Illusion.

=============================================================================
LUDWIG VON KOOPA'S CASTLE #4 SECRET: AN EXTREMELY WELL-HIDDEN BONUS STAGE
Just before the door that leads to the room with the automatically lowering
ceiling, there is a "fake" block in the ceiling that you can jump right through
as if any old hole were there. It allows you to walk on the ceiling above the
myriad balls-and-chains. While there's nothing to the left of note (which is a
shame), you can go up and to the right to find the same old bonus stage where
you can play for up to five 1-ups. Since it takes you to the same room as the
door below does, however, it's hardly worth it to go in and play since you're a
bit pressed for time in this level.

   Forest of Illusion Walkthrough
   ------------------------------

FOREST OF ILLUSION 1
If you have Yoshi, it's good to note that most of the berries here are located
up in the treetops, so if you're looking to get a coin cloud game or poop out a
Mushroom from eating too many of the red berries, that's the place to look. In
any case, get the Fire Flower located above the turn block, then proceed ahead
to the next question block with the Yoshi trapped inside. He'll be helpful
against the many Wigglers in this level, who are impossible to kill with a
normal jump. In fact, provoking them at all turns them red and gets them
running around homing in on you. Eat them on sight along with the portable
springboard, which you can spit out and use to eat the berries in the trees if
you're into that sort of thing. Hit the turn block nestled among the note
blocks and bump a note block to get the subsequent 1-up to pop out. Eat the
three Wigglers after that and touch the midway marker.

You'll now find a transparent block with a changing item. If you know what's
good for you, you'll make it a Starman that you get (see why in the bracketed
section following this level). With the Starman, run forward until you get to
some stacked floating log ledges. Under them you'll notice the keyhole with a
question block above it. That question block has the key in it. Unfortunately,
you'll have to ditch Yoshi to get it. At the end of the log ledges you'll find
a question block next to the gaping chasm separating you from the keyhole. Open
it and get the balloon, then force your fat self over to the left side and bump
the question block from underneath to reveal the key. When you deflate
yourself, grab the key and make the keyhole grow to suck you in. This will take
you to the Forest Ghost House. If you're looking to go to the normal exit, it's
not far ahead of that. Keep Yoshi, eat the Wigglers, bump the Hammer Brother
from underneath, and use his winged gray blocks to get to the goal post. Taking
the normal goal exit will take you to Forest of Illusion 2. We'll cover Forest
of Illusion 2 first, just to make sure you take the correct path to get to
Roy's castle.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 2
From the pipe, go right (the only direction you can go). There's no way to kill
the Urchins floating to and fro and up and down, so wait for them to open up
the one-way path for you. Also, kill the green snorkel-clad fish at any
opportunity. Swim along until you have to go far up to a question block with a
Fire Flower. From there, go right and take the middle path to go forward
through the level. Keep swimming past Urchins until you have to go down, and
then at that point let yourself sink like a boulder. You should see a yellow
exclamation block, and to the left of that, a Rip Van Fish. Examining his
position shows you that you should be able to pass through that rock wall, and
you can. In fact, knowing that means you'll have found the keyhole exit. Take
the key to the hole and play the Blue Switch Palace, then return to this level
and beat it the normal way. That exit isn't too far from the keyhole. Just go
right and avoid the Rip Van Fish. They sink pretty slowly but will wake up from
their slumber if they notice you around. The Whistlin' Chuck summoning fish
from all directions with his shrill whistle doesn't help any, but thankfully
the goal is located just past him.

BLUE SWITCH PALACE
Go through first thing and clear out all the yellow coins that are already
there. Now, hit the silver P-switch first to turn the Spinys all into coins,
and then hit the blue P-switch to make those silver coins fall. There should be
enough there for you to rake in a few more extra lives. Go in the pipe when
you're done and hit the final switch to make all the blue outlines turn into
blue exclamation point blocks. Like the red ones, they have nothing in them and
their only purpose is to give you solid ground to stand on. Save your progress
and go back to beat Forest of Illusion 2 the old way.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 3
Yoshi's the name, and getting him safely to the end of this level is the game
... if you ever want to get to Roy Koopa's castle, that is. You'll find him in
a question block just past a tall blue pipe with a springboard sitting next to
it. When you mount Yoshi, eat the springboard by extending his tongue through
the pipe you just climbed. Carry it along to a tall yellow pipe that you need
to jump over. Ignore all these bubbles - they pop when you touch them, which is
really bad considering most of the time the enemy will pop out and hit Yoshi,
making him run away in fear and most likely into a pit. The midway marker is
important, but not if you lose Yoshi afterward. You need to get him through in
one try if you expect this to work. None of the coin blocks in the big random
scattering of them carry anything important, and neither does the smaller
grouping of turn blocks past that. If you get to the tall green pipe without
losing Yoshi, duck down into it and congratulate yourself. Now you need to be
big to spin-jump the blocks to get the key. You did get a Mushroom, right?
Because they were all over the level encased in bubbles along with the Goombas
and Bob-ombs ...... *sigh* But if you didn't, exit through the yellow pipe,
which puts you right in front of the goal that will take you in a circle back
to the Forest Ghost House.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: FOREST OF ILLUSION 3
That jumble of coin blocks in the middle of the level may only have coins in
it, but there's more than meets the eye on top of four of those coin blocks.
Jump on top of the one farthest to the left to activate the first checkpoint,
then hop up to the next one for #2. Checkpoint #3 is on top of the block nearly
opposite the second one but positioned just a little higher. The final
checkpoint is not on the block directly below the Dragon Coin, but on the one
to the right of and below it just a little. As usual, if you do it in the right
order, the 1-up will pop up for you to grab it.
=============================================================================

FOREST GHOST HOUSE
Now that you've come full circle, you can go ahead and play through this rather
easy level. Move through the Boo Buddies, turning your backs to them so that
you can move them around strategically and have enough breathing room to
maneuver around them. Once out in the open, there's a feather you can get
before going into the next room with a ceiling made of Boo Buddies. The main
goal in this room is to find the P-switch and take it to the far right. Get
some of the coins so that you can drop down into the alcove and then hit the
P-switch to make a silver door appear. When you enter it, you will be on top of
the corridor that you started out inside. There are two doors here, both of
which will allow you to complete the level. However, to get to Forest of
Illusion 4, you want to go in the door nearest you. Outside, there will be
nothing but a goal post. If you go in the "wrong" one, there will be a 3-up
Moon outside accompanying the end-of-level marker, seemingly there to reward
you but really only there to inform you that you just forged a path back to
Forest of Illusion 1. You should go in this door at some point, but only to get
credit for fully completing the level should your goal be to go for all 96.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 4
To stave off the Spiny assault, don't get the 1-up dangling from the Lakitu's
fishing rod at the beginning. He will chase you around, to be sure, but that
doesn't mean you have to fall for it. Keep running until you see a transparent
changing-item block. Get the Starman so you can barrel forward with nary a
worry. The main goal to reach while you have that blessed star is the midway
point, located on top of a skinny yellow pipe lying flat across a muddy brown
plateau. Just after that midway point is the part of this level you should be
focused on. You'll find a blue P-switch sitting right under a pipe-dweller
Lakitu. Hopefully you have a feather; you should get it out of the transparent
block instead of getting the Starman if you don't have one just to secure your
exit in this level. With that feather, run along the bottom floor below the
pipe until you've charged up enough to fly, then jump in the air and land on
the pipe. Grab the key and take it to the keyhole, simple as that. This will
take you to the Forest Secret Area, which in turn leads to the Forest Fortress.
There is very little to get excited about following this point in the level, as
the normal goal exit will only take you in a straight line back to Forest of
Illusion 2 (as indicated by my pitiful ASCII map above). Again, though, if
you're going for a spotless record on your game save, beat it both ways.

FOREST SECRET AREA
This is probably one of the most, if not THE most, entertaining levels in the
game. Once you land on one of the elongated flying platforms, things start
cruisin'. Getting the Dragon Coins is a useless venture unless you take the
time to plot exactly where both of the platforms are headed, which I won't take
the time to do here. Heaven knows I've already wasted enough time talking :)
The only real things of note are that 1) if you've beaten the Blue Switch
Palace already, you should find a filled-in ledge that will allow you easy
access to a free 1-up, and 2) there are three 1-ups located beyond the goal
post. I've tried going over the goal post a million and one times though, and I
can't figure out for the life of me how to get them. Maybe YOU do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: Turns out YOU do! Since February I've received 15 different e-mails
        that explain in full detail how to get those 1-ups located just beyond
        arm's reach. The long list containing the names of those kind enough to
        tell me how to do this is located in the Updates section.

The general consensus seems to be to get a Blue Yoshi (easily available in Star
Road 2, in case you don't know where to get one in a hurry), eat one of the
flying Koopa-Troopas along the way, and then fly above the screen and over the
exit, remaining invisible the whole way. The goal won't register that you
passed it, and you'll be able to get the three 1-ups. Just backtrack and touch
the goal marker to show that you beat it.

This isn't the only way either; still others suggest using Yoshi and doing the
double-jump trick (where you jump while still on him and then dismount with the
A button to get even more height), and some suggest using a cape and flying
over the level. The main gist is that you need to be out of sight to sneak past
the goal marker. So there! Yay! I finally got around to updating it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOREST FORTRESS
You'll begin this Fortress in a room reminiscent of the smashing piston room
from Iggy's castle so long ago at Yoshi's Island. The Grinders on the dotted
lines add a real element of danger to the mix but can be easily ducked under.
Stay to the far right, pressing up against the screen as it scrolls. Having all
four Switch Palaces conquered will certainly help you through this first part
of the level. In the door at the end, you'll find a Grinder coming down off a
rock to meet you on the floor. Jump over it and move on with your life and
yourself. Be wary of both Grinders and fireballs as you make your way toward
the exit. Near the end is a Cape Feather that you'll have to wait patiently to
receive. When you get it, go in the Big Mean-Looking Red Door(tm) and fight
Reznor, tackling him the same way you did in the Vanilla Fortress. Remember
that the bridge starts to collapse bit by bit once you've gotten two of them
down for the count. When you beat the level, save your progress and go back to
Roy's castle even though the Warp Star leading to Star Road 4 is now open.

=============================================================================
FOREST FORTRESS SECRET: WHY PUT IT THERE IF IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT?
If you'll notice, above the first red bolted door leading to Reznor, there is a
cement block path you can walk along. Only take this route if you have a Cape
Feather! For here is the true test of your flying skills - most specifically,
your ability to maintain the same altitude. With the feather equipped, run and
fly the best you know how. It is important that you keep Mario near the ceiling
so that he does not run into any of the bazillion fireballs keeping you from
getting to the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Here, it's
nine 1-ups. However, seeing the potential for faltering and bumping your head
against the ceiling as you're flying, you'll probably waste more lives getting
over there than you'll receive for getting over there. Just take the exit
that's in plain sight and get it overwith in a hurry. You'll be glad you did.
=============================================================================

ROY'S CASTLE #5
Keep on the ledge that creates and destroys blocks at the same time in order to
not fall in the lava to a molten death. You can get four of the five Dragon
Coins you need for a 1-up in here if you make sure to avoid the crusty falling
spikes in the spike area. Jump off when it starts to move down into the pit and
hit the P-switch. A 1-up will fall from the row of brown blocks above, but so
will a fire-breathing Bowser statue. Hurry and get the 1-up without getting
caught in the crossfire and get the feather located above the expanding and
contracting turn block platform if you need it. Beware the reflecting fireballs
as you proceed to the door leading to Roy Koopa.

Roy is a repeat of Morton Jr. with one minor exception: if he makes it all the
way up the wall and falls down from the ceiling, the walls beside you will
shrink in just a bit. He is no tougher to beat than Morton Jr. was, however,
and you can beat him in three hits before he even climbs the wall once. When
you've beaten him, save when prompted and move on to Chocolate Island.

   ----------------------------

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 1
Jump on the Dino Rhino twice to kill him before his tiny version can shoot
streaming flames at you, then walk in front of the bush at the top of the cliff
to make a Mushroom pop out. Grab it and slide down the slope to kill the Dino
Rhino in one hit. The flying block will contain a Fire Flower if you haven't
already gotten one. When you have fire abilities, proceed forward to the yellow
pipe and go in. You'll be instantly fired out of the pipe to your immediate
right without going to any sub-levels, and you'll be at a springboard that will
take you up to the midway point. Excellent!

Hit the P-switch to get over the Munchers and bounce on the Bouncin' Chuck to
turn him into a normal Chargin' Chuck so you can get by unscathed. There's
another flying question block with a Mushroom/Fire Flower in the bowl slope up
ahead and a Yoshi in the question block just beyond the pit. Duck into the
silver pipe near the diagonally right-facing pipe and you'll be shot out of
that diagonal pipe. Position yourself to jump on the red Koopa Troopa, and that
will give you just enough momentum to get to the area where the exit is.

=============================================================================
CHOCOLATE ISLAND 1 SECRET: ANOTHER 3-UP MOON - LIKE YOU NEED IT BY NOW THOUGH
With a feather, go to the bowl-shaped slope where you find the flying question
block with the Mushroom or Fire Flower in it, depending on your current state.
Run down when it's clear of enemies and jump to find a 3-up Moon on a Jugem's
Cloud pedestal.
=============================================================================

CHOCOLATE GHOST HOUSE
The main worry in the first part of this Ghost House is the holes in the floor.
This combined with the large number of Eeries makes jumping out quite
difficult. The Eeries come at you in all sorts of ways - waving around, in
groups of twos, threes, and at one point fives. Be especially wary of the
Fishin' Boo with a hot blue flame on the end of his rod. It might be wise to
get the feather out of the single question block in this room before entering
the door to the right.

In the next room you'll find some Boo Buddies that turn to cement blocks when
you stare them right in the eyes. They are your key to getting out of here
alive. Have them follow you to the section where you see the door on the
high-up wooden ledge. Keep them up in the air by turning your back to them and
constantly jumping. When they're positioned just so, use them as your stepping
stones to the door above. If you managed to keep your feather, you don't need
these guys at all; just fly up to the ledge with your cape. Watch out for the
streams of Boo Buddies that bounce off the walls though, or you will need the
cement ghosts to make it up there.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 2
Where you end up in this level is dependent upon the time that you enter a
certain region. There are many different places you could end up, and they are
all a matter of what time you get to the pipe. As for this one, you want to
make sure you get to it as fast as possible. Get to the top of the chocolate
mesa range here just as fast as your feet will carry you and grab the Yoshi
from the block at the top. Hug the far right wall upon your descent and you'll
land on the green pipe. If you do it fast enough, you'll end up in an area with
lots of slanted slopes. Speed through this area, using Yoshi to get momentum
off of all the red flying Koopa Troopas, and get to the pipe. You should, if
you were fast enough, get to an area with a couple of pesky Pitchin' Chucks.
Run and jump past them, forgetting about the ample supply of Cape Feathers for
the moment and going straight to the key. Grab it or eat it and touch the
keyhole. You'll open up a path around to a pipe that leads to the Chocolate
Secret.

To beat it the normal way (so that you can get to Chocolate Island 3), go to
the part of the level with the slanted cliffs and red Koopa Troopas as usual,
but wait until the timer drops to about 225 to go in the pipe at the end.
You'll find yourself in a place with nothing but bubbles with Mushrooms inside
them. Go through the pipe here and complete the final area with the goal post
to beat it the normal way.

CHOCOLATE SECRET
Run and jump off the springboard to avoid the somewhat hidden Blargg and run
through the next small corridor with the Buzzy Beetles. Use some of their
shells to take out the two Puntin' Chucks up ahead. Slide down the curved hill
and execute a smooth running jump up to the question block, which has a Cape
Feather in it. Ignore the green pipe that you can go in past the next Puntin'
Chuck - it's only a stupid time-waster anyway that doesn't get you any farther.
Use one of the final Puntin' Chuck's footballs as momentum to get to the square
rock ledge opposite the midway point. Enter the sideways green pipe and slide
down all the hills in this room to knock out the Buzzy Beetles, watching out
for the Munchers in the small alcove on the fourth slope.

Skip the Spike Tops in the next pitch-black room. There are a bunch of them in
addition to the sinking ledges that bear a strong resemblance to sharp cheddar.
At the long lava pit, jump to each ledge as they get higher in succession.
You'll then have six Chargin' Chucks to avoid before having to cross some of
the same yellow-orange sinking plateaus that come to points this time around.
There are only six of them, and if you let the last one sink low enough, you
can jump up to a Dragon Coin. The arrow sign next to the pipe indicates that
you're near the exit. Indeed, you are. From here you can now directly access
Wendy O.'s castle, although you might want to go back and complete the rest of
Chocolate Island first.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 3
This is a fairly docile level; nothing much of interest happens here. It is
important that you have a certain item if you expect to get anywhere from here.
Come in big so that the first question block you find (between the two high-up
mushroom ledges) is a feather. If you can retain that feather throughout the
rest of the level, you'll be on Easy Street. Shortly after the feather you'll
find a blue pipe that contains the most funnest bonus level of all time!

...Yeah, you heard me right.

Ride the swinging ledge around and around for a whole lot of coinage, then hop
off to the right and grab the Dragon Coin when you're done spinnin' and
spinnin' around. When you come out of the green pipe, go to the right and look
for the question block that's real high up in the air. Ride around on the
rotating platform, ducking under or jumping over the Fuzzball as necessary,
until you can get that feather. It and the green exclamation block up ahead are
your last hopes of making it anywhere in this world. If you can get one of
those, you're hooked up with the good stuff. The Star Block of course will give
you a 1-up if you got 30 coins (not hard with the bonus stage), and the turn
block has a vine in it so you can get up to the normal exit. Now, with the
feather, fly where the arrow signs indicate. If you have Yoshi, you can also
take the baby's way out and eat the blue Koopa provided for you. You'll find
three 1-ups upon getting over there and you'll gain access to the Chocolate
Fortress. That's a good thing - the normal exit brings you back around in a
circle to this level!

CHOCOLATE FORTRESS
A little of the way into this level, once you're past a couple of the wooden
spikes (that you can lean up against the sides of without getting hurt, by the
way), fire will start appearing from a mysterious source. Avoid the flames as
you dodge the wooden spikes as well, which don't last for very long and are
capped off at the midway point. When you enter the door, approach Thwomp to
make him fall, then drop down the hole while he's coming back up. This long
corridor is full of Thwomps and Thwimps that take a little bit of calculation
to get past. Any time you see a Thwimp, walk under the arc of its jump or
crouch in a safe place where it is difficult to stand in a decent spot (as with
the first one). Having the Red and Blue Switch Palaces by this point is a handy
thing to have crossed off of your to-do list, as several Thwimps and Thwomps
are held in by them if you've hit those switches prior to this level. A Cape
Feather is given to you just before you go in to face Reznor. You've fought
them twice by now, and this time is no different. When you win, proceed to
Chocolate Island 4.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 4
Ha ha! The lava looks like mud! (ahem)

Slide down the big hill and jump on the carrot lift. These things move slowly,
so have patience with them as you progress forward through this level. Once you
cross the long expanse that contains almost nothing but carrot lifts, jump up
the steep long hill and walk along the M-shaped path. Only fall straight down
if you've gotten the blue and red switches hit, because there's no way to get
over to the three 1-ups sitting in open air if you haven't hit. When you've
detoured to get those, find the arrangement of turn blocks with seven of them
in a diagonal line. The third one from the top has a blue P-switch in it. Get
up to it and hit it, then go down and to the left. The brown blocks have turned
into coins and made the way for you to access the previously barricaded silver
pipe. There's another blue P-switch here for you to hit. Fall and fall and fall
until the P-switch timer runs out. Depending on where you land, you get a
number of different items ranging from a feather to a Starman to five (!)
1-ups. Use the floating of the cape to change the speed with which you fall in
order to get what you want. You'll come out of a yellow pipe situated on a bone
ledge with a Fire Flower across from you. Avoid the two Mega Moles situated
here and move ahead to the exit, hitting the Clappin' Chuck if necessary.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 5
Get Yoshi out of the question block surrounded by turn blocks, then board him
and have him eat the blue P-switch. Spit it out onto safe ground (i.e. ground
where you won't fall to your death upon hitting it) and bounce on it. Enter the
first yellow pipe to your right to play a bonus stage for 1-ups. You'll come
out right next to the midway point. Hit the marker and jump to each pipe that
changes in height. After this, you'll see some turn block ledges that expand
and contract both horizontally and vertically. Hop from them to the
growing/shrinking pipe. Time your jump so that it coincides with the Clappin'
Chuck's descent onto the yellow pipe, then leap past the other three and hit
the exit. All in all, a pretty short level.

WENDY O.'S CASTLE #6
Watch out for the large spike at the beginning of the level. If it traps you in
itself, it can kill you even during the temporary invincibility after losing an
item. Bounce all the way up to the top when it moves slowly back into the
ceiling. Duck under or jump over the Grinders as they move along the small
dotted line as the situation warrants and take a running leap up to the cement
block and two red exclamation point blocks. Up next are seven of those huge
spikes that can kill you at the drop of a hat. Watch your timing as you move
past them while also considering the Grinders around you. Once you've finally
passed those, duck and jump at the same time to get past these trickier
Grinders. The last set of huge spikes is the worst one. It takes spot-on timing
to get past. Wait for their (very short) pauses and run/jump past them in that
brief second or so that they're down/up. There's a Mushroom there for you if
you need it. If you manage to get past them, hit the midway mark (it makes you
big if you're small, thankfully) and go in the door.

This next room has scrolling issues that you have to deal with while weaving
around some Sparkys - small electrical sparks that move around surfaces - and
Hotheads (large variation on Sparky). You shouldn't have any problem getting
through this area and getting the Cape Feather at the end of the trail just
before the door leading to the boss. Wendy O.'s method of attack dupes Lemmy's,
except that she has a straight row of pipes (as opposed to his of random
heights) and there are two reflecting fireballs instead of one. Again, the job
is to find the real Wendy amongst the decoys. If you hit the real one three
times, she'll sink into the lava and you'll be on your way to the Sunken Ship,
which is the gateway to the Valley of Bowser.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: WENDY O.'S CASTLE #6
After the seven large spikes situated among the Grinders, there is a cement
block below and to the left of a blue exclamation point block. On the left side
of the block on the ground, you'll find the first 1-up checkpoint. The second
one is on the left side of the block right next to it (in the air), Number
Three is on top of the block, and Number Four is on the right side of it in the
air.
=============================================================================


==-=-==-=-==
~AREA SEVEN~
SUNKEN  SHIP
==-=-==-=-==

Coming out of the gray pipe, swim over to the right and be wary of the Bullet
Bill machines. There's a feather in the only question block in here, so when
you get it, take a dip over to the yellow pipe. The room it leads you to is
probably truly the scariest thing in the whole game. As you swim, Eeries will
fade in and out of corporeality. One minute they're there, the next they're
not. The goal is to halt all activity and tread water the second they pop up.
This lasts for quite a few screens, and your thumbs will probably get tired
from all the crazy treading you have to do. The fading in and out stops once
you get to the circles of Boo Buddies. Wait for the openings and make your way
slowly to the blue pipe.

When you go in, you'll fall way down through a vast chasm of nothing, but you
will have a Starman right there to make it easier. Stay around the middle of
the room, which you'll be more or less around if you can't see the cement walls
on either side of you. Land right and you'll find another Starman to get out of
a singular block. Fall farther through the middle until you pass through a
couple of major coin windfalls and through a hole in the middle of some jutting
cement platforms. Once you're through that hole, veer to the right and look for
a green sphere with a question mark on it. That sphere indicates the end of the
level. Touch it to unlock the mystery that is the Valley of Bowser.

LEGEND
VF - Valley Fortress, the final one of the four fortresses featuring the
     world's worst at adapting to routine, Reznor.

NOTE: Though the Valley of Bowser is technically the final area in the game,
      the walkthrough for Bowser's Castle/Back Door will be placed at the end
      of this guide just before the dialogue in its own separate section.

VALLEY OF BOWSER 1
If you've beaten the Red Switch Palace (which you really _really_ REALLY should
have done by now), the first Mega Mole here won't be able to harass you.
Instead, you have a Chargin' Chuck running right at you. Take the upper path at
the fork, something this level is all about (forks, that is). Let the Mega Mole
in front of you trap himself in the hole so you have stable ground to walk on,
then drop down at the top of the rock stairs and take the bottom path. There
should be a large pile of turn blocks here. The Chargin' Chucks trapped in the
holes will charge their way out so that you can get by them. There is a Cape
Feather to the right that's probably a very wise investment. Ahead, a Chargin'
Chuck will clear out the throwing blocks in your way. For the remainder of the
level, stay along the lowest path possible until you get to the exit (the green
pipe right next to the sign with the arrow on it). You'll come out of an orange
pipe just near the goal.

VALLEY OF BOWSER 2
As each sharp cheddar ledge stoops to your level, jump on it and either dodge
or jump on the Swooper Bats that you can't see from the position the screen is
in. The feather from the question block is a bit risky to pick up when you see
that there's a yellow shell at the top and a naked Koopa about to jump in it.
Jump over him and let him fall off the ledge and hit the block himself, then
get the feather and keep it for yourself; that's the best course of action. Now
just keep going, exterminating bats and picking up coins as you leap across
moving cheese platforms, until you find the midway point. Go in the pipe and go
up and to the left. Jump and you'll find a feather block out of your line of
sight. Get it if you don't have one, then go down to the moving blocks that
form a narrow tunnel. If you have Yoshi, go ahead and get the Yoshi's Wings out
of the question block and beat the level that way. You'll get a blue Yoshi out
of the deal too, so it's win-win - don't have to play the level, you get a blue
Yoshi. It's all good!

Anyway, if you have to go through the tunnel part, just be able to judge
rightly where you can go and where you can't. If you get crushed between two
surfaces, you'll die on the spot no matter what item you may have on you. The
area is significantly harder with Yoshi in tow - he takes up a lot of room, he
does - so ditch him if you have him and make the run yourself.

The third and final room in this level is not horribly difficult, but it does
take some chops. You'll come out of the pipe and land on a yellow cliff that
goes up the moment you step on it. Run and jump if you have a feather and soar
to the top of the wall by curving left as you fly up. Run left to find the
keyhole exit right there in plain sight. That exit will take you quickly up to
the Valley Fortress, which in turn leads to the back door of Bowser's castle.
If you have to take the normal exit, you only have to deal with a couple more
of those rising ledges. Don't kill the Mega Moles - you'll need them as
stepping stones to get to each new one until you reach the end-of-level goal
post.

VALLEY FORTRESS
Run through the enormous spikes before they fall and get the Cape Feather from
the green exclamation point block. Float down through the weird arrangement of
spikes and start whacking the Dry Bones and Bony Beetle with your cape to
eliminate them permanently. You now have to deal with the scary prospect of
jumping from ledge to ledge during the short pause that the large spikes
provide. Jump without floating, as that will slow you down and make you
susceptible to getting crushed like a bug. Once you are past those five, jump
from ledge to ledge over the lava. Get the Mushroom only if there is no spare
item in your box at the top of the screen. When you have passed that point, the
spikes offer very little pause at all, meaning you basically have to study them
for a long time, know when they're about to strike, and jump without fear. Try
not to skid when you leap to the next platform - you could brake too hard and
slide right into a spike. Enter the door at the end if you make it through
almost certain death and fight Reznor for the last time. Save when it asks if
you want to. You can now take a shortcut through Bowser's castle by directly
accessing the back door.

VALLEY OF BOWSER GHOST HOUSE
Here's your reunion with the green gas bubbles, but thankfully you can jump
over them all. The question block at the very beginning contains a
Mushroom/Fire Flower, none of which you'll really need for the task at hand
(there are no tangible enemies; the items will only serve to give you a free
hit). Go in the door and hit the turn block above you to bring the P-switch
down to you. Hit it and start running to the right like a madman. There will be
a thin corridor with many rows of coins between the doors there. If you can
make it to the last one, do that. Failing that, go in the one either one or two
before the last one. That's the normal exit that will take you to Valley of
Bowser 3. There is also a keyhole exit you need to get to, and it is in the
door all the way at the end of that hallway. You'll also nab a 1-up if you make
it there, by the way.

Grab the P-switch and take it all the way to the right and jump up through the
wooden paneling that you can go through. There is a lone coin block in here
that contains directional coins. Hit that first, because if you hit the
P-switch and then the block, the coin that pops out will cause the chain to end
abruptly. Knowing that, hit the coin block and make it go left, up, and right.
While you're doing that, drop and touch the blue P-switch to make the coins
brown blocks. It takes spot-on timing to pull this off, but hop on top of the
brown blocks and make them go up until you see a tiny hole with a key just past
that. Make the brown blocks line up with the hole, and then run into it if
you're small, and duck and slide into it if you're any form of Super Mario.
Grab the key and stick it in the hole that takes you instantly to Larry Koopa's
castle.

VALLEY OF BOWSER 3
Avoid the bouncing green Koopa Troopas at the beginning, then get the feather
out of the block (which will be a Mushroom if you're small). Ride the timed
lifts over the green Koopa Troopas. The number in the middle indicates how many
seconds that lift will last before falling to oblivion; it will always be
either a 1 or a 4. You'll now get some practice with riding them over the great
eternal abyss. Jump to each new one until you get to a large polka-dotted
vegetable-like column. There are two yellow pipes whose ends face each other.
Go in the one you're standing on to go to a bonus stage for 1-ups. When you
exit that, use the springboard to get both the midway marker and the Fire
Flower next to it.

Hop up the successive mushroom ledges and run along the silver wire attached to
the vegetable columns. Take the carrot lift down to the 4-second timed lift,
then try to stay as high up as possible with the help of the red Koopa Troopas
and Banzai Bills. Use the third and final Banzai Bill to boost yourself up to
the 1-second timed lift that will help you reach a higher-up 1-up. Whatever
happens, go from the timed lifts to safe ground and the end of the level.

VALLEY OF BOWSER 4
Avoid the rocks that the Diggin' Chucks scrounge up with their golf clubs and
move across the lava with the help of the red Koopa Troopas until you get to a
green pipe. It's an icy area you go to, but there's a feather here, so the trip
is a bit worth it to be taken backward a few screens. Make up the lost ground
upon exiting and hit the turn block to discover a vine. Climb it and get the
Yoshi out of the question block. There are turn blocks to the right. To keep
Yoshi and still get through them, spin-jump off him with the A button and hop
back on him once you've hit a turn block or two. Yoshi will bounce downward
through them and onto the stone platform that sinks under their combined
weight. If you find this too risky a trick to pull off, take the narrow hole to
the left of the turn blocks, because you need Yoshi in order to complete this
level both ways.

Just past another Diggin' Chuck you'll find the level's midway post. Hit it and
move on with Yoshi, bouncing over the Diggin' Chuck just after the short narrow
passage and getting the feather out of the question block with the aid of the
yellow exclamation block (surely you beat that Switch Palace ages ago - man, I
sure hope so). Proceed through the next batch of Diggin' Chucks and keep going
all the way to the exit. You'll find that the key is trapped in a small chamber
under some cement blocks that no more mortal can access on his own. This is
what you needed Yoshi all that time for; if you're still aboard him, eat the
key and take it up to the open-air keyhole. If you lost him at any point, just
go to the normal exit just past that. The keyhole opens up a direct path to the
fifth Warp Star and Bowser's castle. The normal exit will take you to Larry
Koopa's castle.

LARRY'S CASTLE #7
You've ridden one of these types of ledges already in Roy's castle, though it
wasn't nearly so long there as it is here. Ride it along its predetermined
hard-coded path. There are some invisible 1-up checkpoints to find here, but
they're located around a ball-and-chain's block and aren't nearly worth the
trouble it takes to get them. You need to keep up with the moving brown block
ledge. When it takes you to the door leading to the next area, don't hop to
that door. Ride down into what is supposedly a pit, but you'll find two Dragon
Coins, which are a great find considering the other three are easy to get, a
Mushroom, and a midway point that you won't get otherwise. Cool!

If you don't have a feather, hang your head in shame or gnash your teeth in
anger, just pick one. You'll have to rely on the Magikoopa to get you through
some parts of this area thanks to the turn block walls impeding your forward
progress. Let him destroy enough blocks for you to get through, then kill him
so you don't have to deal with him until the next wall. There are only two of
these, but that doesn't keep Magikoopa from being a complete and utter
nuisance, especially when you consider the narrow corridors you have to
navigate and the other enemies in your way, like wooden spikes and Dry Bones.
Thank goodness there's a Cape Feather at the end of the line, grab it and go in
the Big Mean-Looking Red Door(tm).

Larry Koopa's roots go all the way back to the first castle. His arena is a
duplicate of Iggy Koopa's, save for the fact that three fireballs shoot
constantly upward out of the lava. Know where they come in and keep between
them as you jump on Larry's skull to get him to go farther toward the lava.
When he's in and down for the count, you'll move right on to the last level:
Bowser's castle. Let's go!

But wait ... there is one area we haven't stopped by yet. If we want to beat
all 96 levels in the game, we need to drop by the Star Road. Walk all the way
back to Donut Plains and take the Warp Star located there to Star Road 1. It's
a world unlike anything you've seen yet.

   Star Road Walkthrough
   ---------------------

** In each level in the Star Road, there is a normal exit and a keyhole exit.
   The normal exit will not open up any new roads, but you must still beat it
   that way in order to receive full credit. The keyhole exit, on the other
   hand, will open up a road leading to the next one, which will in turn make
   a complete star-shaped path around the map (only Star Road 5's normal exit
   will create a new path). Hence the name, Star Road. Each level will have
   separate section for its normal exit and its keyhole exit.

STAR ROAD 1
-----------
KEYHOLE EXIT:
Grab the Mushroom at the beginning lest you be of small stature, then drop down
through the middle and hug the far right wall. Start spin-jumping and don't
stop. Within seconds, you'll have found a key sitting right next to a keyhole.
Open it up and head to the second Star Road level.

NORMAL EXIT:
There are several items hidden in blocked-off (no pun intended) areas in this
level. The first you want to go after is down to the far left. Stay against the
wall as you spin-jump to find a Cape Feather sitting out in the open. DO NOT
TWIRL YOUR CAPE WHILE SPIN-JUMPING! It can cause you to be put down several
rows of blocks instantly and get squeezed in between them, resulting in your
untimely death. Go down through the hole at the bottom at the rock ledges and
stay to the near right for a 1-up, then let yourself go straight down to find a
Starman. Don't kill too many of the Koopa Troopas, however, because soon enough
down the trail you'll find a Red Yoshi. Red Yoshis will take any shell they eat
and expel the remnants as a trio of fanning fireballs. Have him eat five
enemies or one item (either a wandering Starman or the spare item from your
box) and board him if you want him. Go through the pipe in the bottom right
corner when you finish the level.

STAR ROAD 2
-----------
NORMAL EXIT:
To make the Blue Yoshi grow instantly, let him eat the Starman that floats down
from above when he hatches. It will go on a path directly to his mouth, so
don't worry about feeding him fish. If you get the star for yourself, however,
there is another one in the question block in the middle of the level if you're
still invincible by the time you get around to it. This can result in many
1-ups if you hit plenty of fish along the way. The whole point of this level,
however, is swimming around eating fish. Board Blue Yoshi and hang onto him if
possible. This is one level you definitely want to remember the place of; it's
the only place in the game where you can get a Blue Yoshi hatched fresh from
the egg. Anyway, get the Blue Yoshi and swim to the green pipe at the end. No
questions asked.

KEYHOLE EXIT:
You probably noticed that the wall doesn't stretch all the way down to the
bottom below the green pipe leading to the normal exit. Ergo, swim through that
tunnel under the wall and around to the key. Eat it, unlock the hole, and be on
your way.

STAR ROAD 3
-----------
NORMAL EXIT:
You are a fool if I have to tell you how to do this.

KEYHOLE EXIT:
Now this I understand, it's a bit tricky and requires some decent timing. It is
a little easier if you have some help from a Fire Flower. Let the yellow Yoshi
chow down on Spinys as Lakitu throws them down. Head up the throwing block
staircase and hit Lakitu with a fireball. Killing Lakitu with fireballs makes
the cloud stay materialized forever, whereas normally if you kill him with a
shell or anything else the cloud will disappear after a short time. Anyway,
take the cloud and go up. Jump out to the left to get the key out of the
question block, then take it over to the hole to the right.

STAR ROAD 4
-----------
KEYHOLE EXIT:
Run up to the second mushroom ledge and get the red Yoshi from the egg, or
quickly try to salvage the 1-up if you already are riding a Yoshi. Go on to the
blue Koopa Troopas and eat them, then immediately take to the skies and fly as
far as you can. You should be able to fly to about the middle of the level,
where the five red Koopa-Troopas are hovering up and down in the sky. Shortly
after that, find the platforms made entirely of green and red exclamation point
blocks. If you're riding Red Yoshi, get off him if you don't have a feather -
you have to whack the question block from the side to get it to open up with
the key. In any event, get the key and end the level.

NORMAL EXIT:
From the green exclamation point block ledge, go up to the cement sidewalk and
use the red shell to get rid of the green one that the Koopa kicks at you. Go
forward to the rotating platform triad up in the air, and if you still have a
Yoshi, try to eat the blue Koopa Troopa and fly your way to the exit. If you
can't, that's okay - the exit isn't too far ahead and there are no other
enemies to get in your way.

STAR ROAD 5
-----------
KEYHOLE EXIT:
Don't waste your time fooling around with all these stinkin' falling platforms.
Get the Blue Yoshi out of Star Road 2 and have him eat the first Koopa Troopa
you find. Fly to the ledge with the P-switch and the single question block. The
question block contains directional coins that you need to keep going to the
right. Hit that block and then the P-switch to get the bridge moving, then eat
another Koopa Troopa (any color with Blue Yoshi, remember) and fly straight up.
This is where you'll need to have all the Switch Palaces conquered in order for
this to work. The first of the four sections of the ledge is comprised entirely
of yellow exclamation point blocks. You'll have to dismount Yoshi to get past
the cement block on the green section - run under it if you're small, duck and
slide like a pro if you're any sort of Super Mario. Finally, run along the red
and blue sets to find the keyhole sitting right next to the exit.

NORMAL EXIT:
Use the directional blocks in conjunction with the P-switch until you get to
the edge of a mushroom column with a yellow egg on it. Eat Spinys and Koopa
Troopas until Yoshi grows up all big and stuff, then eat enemies on your way to
the exit. This exit wraps back around to Star Road 1 while the keyhole exit
will take you to a sixth Warp Star that leads to the marvelous Special World.
Take the plunge if you dare.......

   Special World Walkthrough
   -------------------------

GNARLY
Hop on the message block (read it first if you like, it's just a trivial little
vignette) to get to the line-guided rope. Jump from the rope to the pea
springboard. Use it to curve to the right and hit the turn block against the
rope wall. A vine will pop out; spring up to it and climb it, then get off at
the note blocks to your left. Go down to the two pea springboards facing each
other. In the turn block above the one on the left is a blue P-switch. Getting
this will be a great boon to you _if_ you can hang on to it. Go up each series
of two note blocks and get the feather out of the top turn block. Jump up to it
and lay the P-switch down on the cement peak of the level, then hit it and jump
down against the far right wall. You'll land on a question block that wasn't
previously there but is during the time you hit the P-switch. You'll come out
of a silver pipe next to three Dragon Coins and three 1-ups. If you can't get
to that pipe, there's one all the way at the bottom of the screen. You'll come
out in the same area but out of a green pipe that doesn't allow for access to
the prizes I just mentioned. Hit one of the blue P-switches to make the
question blocks appear in the form of a bridge, then hit the silver P-switch to
make all enemies during the timer into silver coins (collect enough of them for
1-ups). Use the Hammer Brother's flying ledge to get to the higher ground, then
run past the bush to reveal a hidden Mushroom and boogie on over to the exit.

=============================================================================
INVISIBLE 1-UP CHECKPOINTS: GNARLY
At the top of the level, fall and hug the rope wall on the left when you fall
down the right half of the level (so that you go between the rope and the
column of four note blocks. The 1-up will meet you at the bottom.
=============================================================================

TUBULAR
Arguably the hardest level in the game, but you have to beat it if you want
credit for all 96. As a word of warning, you might want to bring a feather in
with you. It may save you by the skin of your teeth at the end of the level.

Carom off the Clappin' Chuck and move along pipes until you find a P-switch.
Grab it and curve to the left when you fall to the springboard below. Drop it
and you'll hit it the next time you land on the springboard. Hit the question
block and fan out to the right to hit a P-balloon. The next one is past the
Pitchin' Chuck standing on the single suspended question block, above him and
to his right. Float through the red Koopa Troopas and VERY CAREFULLY past the
Volcano Lotuses all the way to a Puntin' Chuck standing on a question block.
That's the last balloon you need to get in order to get to the exit, and it's
very well-guarded. You just have to know when to duck down and get under the
footballs. The real kicker (no pun intended) is when the Puntin' Chuck above
you kicks a football right down on your head when you finally do get the
balloon! Should you run out of air to inflate yourself too soon, that's where
the feather comes in handy. If you lose your air at a certain point, you can
float successfully to land by holding Y and a direction (right, in this case)
and hope for the best.

Luckily, you are given the chance to save after every two levels in the Special
World. When you finally do beat this one, take the opportunity to do so and
move on.

WAY COOL
Jump on the line-guided platform and don't hit the ON blocks until the third
one in your path. After the path switches directions, hit the very next ON
block to put it back in its original position. You'll be taken all the way to
the top of the level where a yellow pipe sits, isolated from everything else.
Go in to find a Yoshi in the single question block seen here. Exit through the
pipe to the right and look in the question block to your right. Yoshi's Wings
are inside. Grab them and complete the bonus level with ease, making sure to
keep your Blue Yoshi all the while.

AWESOME
Bringing the Blue Yoshi you just got from Way Cool into this level, eat the
color-flashing shell to derive every special ability from it. Use this time to
fly until you get to a blue P-switch. Hit it and run, hitting or eating enemies
as you go, until you get to a platform that looks like a metallic purple arch.
Do the midair dismount to hit the question block way above you. A Starman is
inside. Grab it and run as fast and far as you can with your temporary
invincibility. To keep from sliding, just run and jump without thinking too
hard on it or dwelling on where you land too much. If you keep the star on you,
the constant Cheep-Cheeps flying in wide arcs from the bottom of the screen
(that's cool, very old-skool). At the end of the level, run down the subzero
slope and hit the marker. Since this is an even-numbered Special World level,
be sure to save your progress.

MONDO
The rising and falling tide definitely makes this a much harder level, as
evidenced by the struggle to kill the first Hammer Brother. Get the feather up
ahead once you've finally done him in, then go up and face off with another
Hammer Brother. Swim over the green pipe or use the flying ledge that Hammer
Brother hopefully was on and proceed to the question blocks that progress
diagonally upward. The top one of the trio contains a Yoshi in case you lost
yours. Get him and go in the first blue pipe to your right. You'll go to a
stratospheric bonus stage where you can slide down a cloudy slope for coins
(plus a Dragon Coin at the bottom). You'll start quite a bit farther ahead when
you return to Mondo. Go right to a huge assortment of question blocks where
you'll find a Fire Flower in the top row. That's a useful asset for killing all
the fish floating around if you lack a Yoshi to eat them up. Bonk the Hammer
Brother's ledge to knock him off and wait for the tide to rise before you go in
the pipe leading to the level's end.

GROOVY
You might recognize this level even without having played it, and for good
reason - it's the level you see in the opening cinema at the game's title
screen. If you've seen the computer Mario play through that, you know how the
first part of this level goes. Hit the Koopa Troopa and kick his shell forward
to reveal a Yoshi in a grounded question block. Each color Koopa Troopa is up
ahead, and they're all walking in a single-file line. Discard green and red and
eat blue, flying until you get to a transparent item block. Spit at the shell
at that point and wait for the item to change to a star, then plow ahead
through the Pokeys. You should get far enough to face a literal wall of Pokeys
although there are only three of them. Eat all their segments and jump from the
top plateau to the blue pipe to the slanted cliff. A couple of Pitchin' Chucks
round out the level, and you can eat the Pokeys and the Volcano Lotus
restricted to the ground if you need them out of the way. Finally, save when
prompted.

OUTRAGEOUS
Have a Yoshi coming into this level, he'll really help out with some of the
enemies you have to deal with here, especially the hopping flames. They leave a
trail of baby flames that sit there and make it difficult to proceed along the
ground. Fortunately, Yoshi has an iron stomach and can eat the flames with
ease. Take the springboard after getting the flower out of the question block
and bring it with you in order to clear some of the taller Bullet Bill
machines. After clearing the first one, have Yoshi eat the springboard from the
other side of the cannon. Keep it in his cheeks, but make sure he doesn't eat
it, and spit it out for a moment if he starts with the swallowing reflex. Keep
spitting it out to leap over the cannons and eating it again until you get to a
very tall orange pipe. Eat the Wigglers and the springboard through the orange
pipe to use it again at the yellow pipe you find shortly. Eat it again and keep
it with you until you get to a blue pipe near a fairly small Bullet Bill turret
(you may need to spit it out a couple of times to keep him from gulping it
down). That's the last you'll need of the springboards and Yoshi - if you can
make it to the end of the level, then it's in the bag.

FUNKY
Ah, yes, the last of the Special World levels - practically unbeatable without
a Yoshi at your side. With only 200 seconds, you need to hurry up to get out of
here with time to spare. Run past the Sumo Brother at the beginning and jump
over the green pipe, eating the green berry off the bush. They are the key to
your success; each green berry you eat adds 20 seconds to the clock. Don't
attempt to eat the blue Koopa Troopas on the thin cliffs. You need Yoshi's
mouth free of excess stuff to keep them open for green berries. Bump the Sumo
Brother off the question blocks and down the green berry on the next bush. Now
is when you should eat the blue Koopa Troopa to fly over the next Sumo Brother
duo. Keep low to the ground so you can find the next green berry, which is
right behind a Pitchin' Chuck. Spit it out so that the Whistlin' Chuck ahead
can't call a swarm of Super Koopas to maraud you. Use running jumps to get
across the throwing block platforms, then bump the note block the Sumo Brother
is standing on. You don't have time for the multiple coin block above the turn
block; instead, eat the green berry, then swallow the blue Koopa Troopa. Don't
use him for flying; use him to get rid of the Whistlin' Chuck just beyond him -
Super Koopas are not your friend. Eat the green berry after expelling the blue
shell from Yoshi's mouth. From this point, you just need to keep running and
eating green berries to keep the time up. Your perseverance is eventually
rewarded - look for a coin display at the end of the level that reads YOU ARE A
SUPER PLAYER !! This should be good for a couple of 1-ups. When you're done
getting the coins, hit the goal marker and save when asked.

A pipe will now open up, and you'll be taken back to a brave new world.....
okay, it's just Yoshi's Island, but you'll now notice that the terrain has
changed color in favor of a brighter palette. Some enemies, such as most Koopa
Troopas and the jumping Piranha Plants, also experience some facial makeovers.
It's not much of a reward, but such is your prize for beating the Special
World.

Now, you've conquered all 96 levels save for one - Bowser's castle. Now that
you've beaten every other place there is (whether with my help or not), it's
time to pay a visit to the King of the Koopas.

~~~BOWSER'S CASTLE & BACK DOOR~~~
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
There are four doors you can go in at the start of Bowser's castle - it's kind
of like "Let's Make a Deal" in that regard, picking a door to see what's
inside. Here's a detailed description of what's inside each door. They all lead
to a room that contains doors 5, 6, 7, and 8. You must play through two of the
doors in order to get to the last room of the castle (which you can get to
instantly via the back door if you've beaten the Valley Fortress). Here's
what's inside doors 1-4.

DOOR #1
This door harkens back to Iggy's castle with yet more of those rock smashers
you know and love. Having all the switches hit will certainly help here, and
you'll see the fireballs pop out of the lava ponds between those blocks. After
the room's halfway point, the fireballs start popping up in pairs, making your
life harder by just a little. The door to the second quartet of mini-levels is
not too far ahead though, so you should be fine going in here.

DOOR #2
This room is short and is just a matter of getting along the fence without
getting hit by reflecting fireballs. There are just enough Koopa Troopas moving
along the fence for you to net a 1-up if you hang in there, but you're better
off speeding to the exit.

DOOR #3
This room is confusing as all get-out. Find the canvases that you can move
through and get to the exit as quickly as possible. If you feel like hunting
for items, there are a feather and a 1-up to be found in here. The Mecha-Koopas
can be jumped on, carried, and kicked into each other to be killed.

DOOR #4
Ride the gray back-and-forth block under the tall one with the Sparky moving
around it and jump up before you fall off (it will overlap on top of the
bluish-gray block). There are two more moving gray blocks to deal with, but
they're nothing along with the Sparkys and the one Hothead on the final ledge.
Make it to the door to get to the second set of selectable rooms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you get to the exit of Rooms 1-4, you'll be taken to a hallway through
which you can access Rooms 5-8. Here for your FAQ pleasure, the walkthroughs
for the next four rooms of Bowser's castle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOOR #5
A simple room. Run as fast as you can and neither the huge spikes nor the
Thwomps will get you.

DOOR #6
Now _here's_ a tough one. Swim up through the first hole to the right before
the spikes can get through and crush you against the wall. The next set of them
will probably be against the wall too early for you to swim up through them the
first time, so wait for them and retreat if the Dry Bones gets too close for
comfort. Get the feather in the question block in the midst of the Fishbones,
then swim up through the spike-laced tunnels when the moving portion creates a
hole all the way through. The final evil part of this level has you stroking
your way through a series of balls-and-chains swinging around haphazardly.
Follow the last moving set of spiked walls through its motions and enter the
pipe at the top. If you're smart, though, you won't go in this door at all and
you'll opt for one of the easier ones.

DOOR #7
If you've beaten the Red and Blue Switch Palaces, this one won't be a problem
as the two most troublesome stationary Bowser statues will be high enough for
you to hop around without worry or care. Just beware the jumping brown Bowser
statues and you'll do great.

DOOR #8
This room is packed to the hilt with Bouncin' Chucks. Jump on every one you see
to reduce them to lowly Chargin' Chucks and get the Cape Feather from the green
exclamation point block if you've unlocked the blue exclamation blocks already.
Go in the door at the end to get to the last room (the back door).

BACK DOOR
You'll notice it's extremely dark when you enter the room. This can be remedied
by hitting the red question block up ahead. It will turn on the strobe light at
the top of the screen that follows you around as you go through this room. Jump
on the Ninjis (a throwback to SMB2) to kill them and deal with the Mechakoopas
by tossing them into nearby lava pools. When you get to the bridge near the
door, you'll find a midway point that will turn you big if you're small. This
midway point is only here if you take the front door to get into the castle,
not the actual back door that you see on the Valley of Bowser map. When you're
ready, take a deep breath and enter the last of the game's Big Mean-Looking Red
Doors(tm). Look ahead to the Epilogue to witness the final account of the
battle with Bowser.

     EPILOGUE **WARNING: SPOILERS**
     ==============================

Here for your reading pleasure is a narrative tale of the final epic battle
Mario had with Bowser, as told to me by an onlooking Toad who swears he saw the
whole thing. I'll have to take his word after it - after all, I doubt that such
a peaceful inhabitant of the Mushroom Kingdom would lie to a guy like me.

"The King Koopa was certainly an intimidating sight. I had seen his vehicle
before - he referred to it as the Clownmobile, or something like that - and it
was scarier to see it in action than idle. Bowser swooped down at Mario - I
thought he was never going to stop! But then he threw two Mechakoopas out of
his Clownmobile, like they were boggin' him down or somethin'. Mario, though,
he's a resourceful guy. He took both Mechakoopas, clubbed 'em on the head with
his feet, and kicked them up so that they landed on Bowser's head, both of 'em!
Bowser slipped out for a moment to recuperate, looked like, and in that time it
rained down some fire from the sky! Mario dodged it though by jumping back
behind it where he could, 'cause he's Mario. He's just that awesome. The
Princess popped out for a little bit and threw a Mushroom out to Mario - just
for support. Then Bowser crammed her back in and came in with a new game plan.

He started flipping the Clownmobile upside-down and dropping these huge marbles
out of it that would roll at Mario. I don't know where he got the room to fit
them all in his goofy little 'Mobile, but he did. Mario blocked them
effectively by spin-jumping them like he did the green gas bubbles in the ghost
houses. Bowser would clear out some more Mechakoopas, but Bowser was staying
higher up this time and it was hard to get them up over the Clownmobile. He
eventually figured out that jumping and kicking them up in the air would do the
trick if he timed it right. That Mario, he's a genius he is.

There was more fire from the sky and another Mushroom from the Princess, which
Mario saved in his spare item box for when he might need it. But the
Clownmobile got a dirty look on its face, it did, and it started bouncing along
the castle roof, shaking the ground as it bounced along. Mario did his best to
run under it when it was airborne and waited until he threw out some more
Mechakoopas to plan his attack. The Clownmobile was a deceptive vehicle though,
and it was hard to stand on the ground and kick up, so Mario repeated the
jumping and kicking up thing. After the sixth and final hit, Bowser's
Clownmobile went out of commission and he was gone from the lives of Mario and
the Princess - for a while anyway. And that's the end of that story!"

Congratulations on beating Super Mario World! Now sit back and enjoy the final
cinema. (You can't reset at the screen that says THE END, by the way.)

     CREDITS AND LEGAL JAZZ
     ======================

Ahh, it feels good to be back in the game! After over four months away from
FAQ-writing, I've finally finished this enormous comeback project, and the time
spent with it has been great. Here's one section I haven't missed, however, and
that's the obligatory thank-you's that just have to go at the end of every FAQ.
Here mine are, in no particular order of gratitude:

** Nintendo for this great game, the premiere launch title of the SNES.

** FuSoYa, Defender of Relm. He's the creator of a (now defunct) program that
   contains several detailed maps of all the levels in SMW called Lunar
   Magic. It's also a level editor, and a very user-friendly one at that. I
   used the maps extensively in my research of several secrets located in the
   game.

** Andrew Schultz, a great and mighty FAQ/review writer, whose abilities will
   always exceed mine no matter how I improve. Talking with him in a couple
   of AIM conversations, he gave me the encouragement and the motivation to
   get up and do another FAQ. I like the man, I love his work, and he's a
   great guy. I tip my hat to thee, good sir.

** Everyone who e-mailed me regarding the three extra lives in the Forest Secret
   Area.

** Pizza-flavored Pringles and Cherry Coke. They do a body good - at least,
   when writing FAQs.

** My parents, who, as it turns out, are totally supportive of my FAQ and
   review writing - even more so because I'm good enough to make money off of
   it!

** Anyone who has supported my writing talents at any point along the long
   road to my success.

but I like to lay down a firm set of guidelines for prospective users of my
FAQs to abide by. First of all, ask permission if you want to use this or any
of my other guides on your website at the account where I answer all my mail:
<eubanks1084@hotmail.com>. Just ask me in a short and sweet request for
permission to use it, and provide me with a URL so I can check out your site
and see if it's "legit" (I know that's a word all the happenin' youngsters are
throwin' around these days). If I'm "down with that," I'll let you use my FAQ.
Just ask nicely, I'll probably say yes anyway, "homeslice." And if you plan to
use my "walkthrough," don't "link" directly to it, but instead link to the "web
page" with the "link" on "it."

Don't sell this document for a cash profit. Give it freely to those who are
without Internet access and need it. They'll appreciate your gift greatly. If
you plan to use my walkthrough on your website, you may not change the text in
any way, shape, or form, but if you want to add a visual aid such as
screenshots or change the structure of the text (font, font size, font color,
etc.), that's fine with me. As long as the words stay the same.

And above all, don't plagiarize this work. It's my intellectual property and by
being published in a tangible form (in this case, on the Internet), it is
automatically subject to U.S. federal copyright laws. If you put your stamp on
my FAQ, you're stealing. And I have ways to hunt you down. Don't think I don't
run some key phrases through Google occasionally. If you're caught burgling my
work, I'll find you out so fast and make sure something happens to you.

On a final note, remember that the latest version of this walkthrough can
always be found at GameFAQs and IGN.com. I really hope the latter is keeping
tabs on my updated work.

Have a great day, and have fun playing Super Mario World!
