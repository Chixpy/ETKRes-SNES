This game features great game play along with an awesome plot and
killer graphics for its time. Another words it rocks. Anyway I'm going
to tell the story behind the game which can be found in your
instruction manual.

STORY:
After saving Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser and the rest of the Koopas in
Super Mario World 3, Mario and Luigi needed to recuperate from their
adventures. Together they agreed that the best place to vacation was a
magical place called Dinosaur Land.

But while Mario and Luigi reclined on the beach for a relaxing nap,
Princess Toadstool disappeared, apparently seized by evil forces. After
searching for hours for their missing friend, Mario and Luigi came upon
an enormous egg in the forest.

Suddenly the egg hatched, and out popped a young baby dinosaur named
YOSHI, who proceeded to tell Mario and Luigi a sad tale of how his
dinosaur pals were sealed in similar eggs by a group of monstrous
turtles.

"Monstrous turtles!," exclaimed Luigi. "Bowser and his bunch have
returned!" Mario slowly nodded his head in agreement and, along with
Luigi and Yoshi, set off across Dinosaur Land to find the princess and
free Yoshi's friends. As they began their journey, Yoshi handed Mario a
beautiful cape. "This may help you," Yoshi said. "Some say it has
magical powers."

With little luck (and help from a magical cape), our hearty crew can
defeat the seven worlds of Bowser's Krazy Koopa Kritters. Many
locations are well-hidden so explore everywhere and try everything. Not
all locations have to be explored to rescue the dinosaurs and save
Princess Toadstool, but there are many "starry" treasures to be found
in far-reaching places. You'll need to search all to find out what
treasures are there... in Super Mario World.

Sounds cool huh? Well trust me it is! Now, on to the guide!

Some items will make Mario have special powers the items are:
Mushroom = Super Mario
Flower = Fire Mario
Feather = Caped Mario
Star = Invincible Mario
Power Balloon = Flying Mario
Every time you get one of these items you will change your form. Now
what will you turn into? Here's what you'll turn into. NOTE: Fire Mario
isn't better than Caped Mario or the other way around. It depends what
your comfortable with. Once you know whom you play with then you know
that this is the form you want to try to stay in for the whole game.

Invincible Mario (which can be acquired by a star) can overlap your
current Mario making him even more powerful. The same thing goes with
the Power Balloon except Mario is not invincible he can now fly. NOTE:
You can't have the Power Balloon and the Star activated at the same
time.

|Yoshi Tips|
1: If shells are left in Yoshi's mouth to long, Yoshi will swallow them
after a while. If this happens, Yoshi can no longer do the amazing
things he can do when he holds them in his mouth.
2: If an enemy hits Yoshi when Mario is on Yoshi's back, you won't lose
Mario or any strength; however, Yoshi will run away. If this happens,
you'd better chase him with all your might, because if Yoshi falls off
a cliff or into a hole, he'll be gone for sure.

mouth. You need to grow into big Yoshi first though before you can do
this.
 __________
|Blue Yoshi|
Blue Yoshi can fly for a fixed length of time, whatever the color of
the shells in its mouth. You need to grow into big Yoshi first though
before you can do this.
 ____________
|Yellow Yoshi|
Yellow Yoshi throws out sand clouds for a fixed length of time when he
jumps, whatever the color shell in its mouth. You need to grow into big
Yoshi first though before you can do this.

===========================
= World 1: Yoshi's Island =
===========================

===============
=Yoshi's House=
===============

Can't really do anything here. You can eat a bunch of berries after
getting Yoshi though.

==================
=Yoshi's Island 1=
==================

Start off by jumping up for a dragon coin. I will not tell you every
single enemy to beat, as it would be boring. But watch out for the big
bullets that come a lot. Go along to the right, and spin some yellow
blocks when you find them. Go in, and get the stuff here and get out.
You will land on the mid-way gate. Keep going right; grab the dragon
coin along the way. Fire the shell up to free the 1-up. Keep going
right, and grab the extra life when it comes down. Keep going, and get
the final dragon coin for a life. Ignore the charging chuck and beat
the level.

======================
=Yellow Switch Palace=
======================

This level shouldn't need explaining, but I will anyway. Step on the
switch, and grab as many coins as you can in the time limit (you should
be able to grab 3 extra lives here) then go into the pipe. Step on the
huge switch, and now all yellow dotted lines will be filled with yellow
bricks! Now head to the next level.

==================
=Yoshi's Island 2=
==================

You can gain 5 lives here. Send the shell going up above, then run
after it until it kills a couple more enemies then jump so it won't hit
you. Go back, and ride Yoshi. If you still have Yoshi about halfway
through the level, the block here will have a 1-up, and it will contain
Yoshi if you had lost him. The right yellow bricks have a secret vine
in it. Jump off Yoshi, climb up and get the stuff, and get back on
Yoshi. Keep going, and you can go into the blue pipe but don't just
yet. Continue on and eat all the berries first. When you get two pink
ones, a cloud will come and give you coins and eventually a 1-up. Now
go in there. You can't however get two pink ones in this stage. But go
ahead and eat all the red berries first. Now you have to super jump off
of Yoshi to hit all the blocks. One of them has a 1-up. When done, go
into the pipe and go all the way right to the end.

==================
=Yoshi's Island 3=
==================

This level requires some jumping skills. First off, jump up to the top.
Continue right, and be careful of the yellow blocks that move around.
You don't really have to worry if you have already gotten the yellow
switch palace though as there are many of these in the pit. You can
have fun here if you have blue Yoshi, which you don't get for a while.
You can fall under the block, release dozens of mushrooms, and grab
them all at once, which is very fun to do. Anyway, this level doesn't
really need much explanation, just jump across all the pits and
platforms. There is a secret worth mentioning, after jumping a couple
of white platforms and to the right there is a yellow pipe down below
which you can enter. Get the stuff and get out of there. Get the midway
gate, and jump along many platforms again. That star block will give
you a 1-up if you have a lot of coins. If you don't, it will just give
a coin. Now just go right and beat the level. Another thing worth
mentioning is if you can super jump off of Yoshi at just the right time
and hit the bar when it's at the top, you will get "50" and gain three
lives too. When this meter hits 100 you will enter a bonus game, which
is described at the end of this walkthrough.

==================
=Yoshi's Island 4=
==================

There is a secret 1-up here. If you have Yoshi, you can super jump off
of him to the top above the screen. Run right and stay near the edge of
the right side of the island, which has an item block on it. Soon a 1-
up will come from the sky and land right on you. Go into the pipe, and
do everything here. When you get back into the stage, shoot the shell
up for the "p" switch. Use it, then quickly hit the block to the right
for a Starman. Go right, and get as many lives as you can and go to the
pipe to the right to the end.

==========================
=Castle #1: Iggy's Castle=
==========================

This level can be rich in extra lives. One word of wisdom: don't ever
jump off the wire once on. Keep stomping the Koopas over and over and
eventually you will start getting lives. Keep going, then you can
switch sides of the wire and get even more lives. All the way to the
right is a door to a new area. Watch out for the pistons here. They
don't kill you, but you will get hurt by them. Then, finally, all the
way to the right is the boss door. The boss isn't too bad. Just jump on
him when it is titled in the direction you want him to fall. Soon, he
will be one with the lava and you will have beaten this world.

=========================
= World 2: Donut Plains =
=========================

================
=Donut Plains 1=
================

Get the cape from the enemy that is flashing. To fly, get a running
jump, then while holding the run button, press the button opposite of
where you are flying. Example: Run forward, jump while running, let go
of the jump button but keep holding the run button, and every second or
so press back on the control panel to keep flying. If on Yoshi you will
just make a very large jump if you take a running leap. This level
shouldn't prove much of a challenge. When you find a purple pipe, there
is a bonus round. Something worth mentioning here is if you have a
cape, the blocks will always give you a "0" if you hit the block from
the left with your cape. Collect all your lives, and get out of here.
After you are out of there, there is another pipe. You can practice
your flying skills here. Near the end, there is one last secret.

Secret Exit:
Jump off of Yoshi up above just to the right of the green pipe. You
should be standing on ground up above. Hold to "B" button and move
around a bit, and while doing this, go right into the keyhole (what you
grabbed was the key.) You can also fly into this area to get up.

Normal Exit:
Just go right from where you would get the secret exit.

================
=Donut Plains 2=
================

Fairly self-explanatory level. The only part worth mentioning is about
halfway through there are platforms going up to the ceiling. The third
pipe you can enter.

Normal Exit:
Just go all the way right to the pipe that leads to the goal.

Secret Exit:
Grab the shell in the enclosed area, and fire it at the highest up
block to reveal a vine. Climb up it, and use the key. This is easier
with blue Yoshi.

=====================
=Green Switch Palace=
=====================

Hit the switch, and get the Koopa to kick the shell and get you an
extra life from all the enemies below. Now just hit the big switch.

===================
=Donut Ghost House=
===================

Secret Exit:
If cape Mario, take a running jump from the right to the left and fly
up into the area. Continue right, and go down the pit for some lives
and the exit.

Normal Exit:
Head right, jumping over gaps along the way and going through the door
at the end. In here, go into the door to the right. Now, if you want
coins, hit the switch here and head left. If you want to finish the
stage, head into the door again and hit the block for a vine that heads
up to the goal.

================
=Donut Plains 3=
================

Another very self-explanatory level. The only parts worth mentioning
are the following. When you find the "On" and "Off" switches be sure to
hit one as you come to it. And, when you get the choice between going
on a white platform and a platform above, go above. You will get to a
pipe that leads to a bonus round, which afterwards takes you to the end
of the level.

================
=Donut Plains 4=
================

Right at the start you can eat a rainbow shell if you have Yoshi. Fly
right as fast as you can, and shoot it at the very annoying hammer
brother guy. When you come to some slopes, kick a shell and gain a life
from all the enemies down there. Keep heading right, and go into the
pipe near the huge green pipe. Do everything here, and fly right over
the hammer brother guy. Continue right, and hit the block when it is a
feather, and it will be a Starman when it comes to you. Blaze through
to the end of the level with it.

============================
=Castle #2: Morton's Castle=
============================

Before you go here, get a couple capes. Now time your fly so you can
get up above. (If you decide not too, you will have to navigate through
another area) and enter the door at the top. Continue up, until you
find a bone guy below two other bone guys. Go to the right wall, and a
1-up will appear. This is the easiest boss in the game. Just stop him,
then before he can move much, stomp him again, and do this 3 times and
you've won.

================
=Donut Secret 1=
================

A little through the level you will find a pipe. Go into it. Fly up to
the right for a fire flower, and to the left to get more air. Fly up
some more, and get the 1-up and two dragon coins.

Secret Exit:
Get out of here; continue through the level until you find a P switch.
Grab it, but do not step on it yet. Go right until you find some
blocks. Now use it. Get the key in the block, and beat the level.

Normal Exit:
Just continue through the level, not any trouble in this stage really;
just go right until you find the goal.

====================
=Donut Secret House=
====================

Dodge around the ghost circlet, and hit the P switch. Spring over the
big boo. Go in the door to the right. NOTE: You can defeat the Big Boo.
Slide down the ramp onto him and he will "die". Continue, and dodge
around this ghost circle as well.

Exit #1:
Continue left, and grab the switch. You need to be cape Mario before
getting this far. Now glide up to the upper right of this room, and use
the switch in this area. A door will appear, go in. To defeat this mini
boss big boo, you must chuck the blue blocks at him as he reappears
three times, then you've won. You now have access to the Star World.

Exit #2: Grab the coins in the outline of a door. I think you get the
idea. Go left, grab the switch, and hit it and go into the newly
appeared door (the blue one, not the normal door) for exit #2.

================
=Donut Secret 2=
================

Shoot the block with a shell, and try to control the coins so that it
never runs into anything (you can get 64 coins from it total) and head
right. Use the spring to get up into a secret area, with a Starman.
Blaze right with it. Go into the green pipe in the ceiling for some
coins. Keep going right, and at the end you can kill several Koopas in
one swoop to earn a life.

=======================
World 3: Vanilla Dome:
=======================

================
=Vanilla Dome 1=
================

Easy enough level. Just head right, and go around the blocks to get to
the right.

Secret Exit:
To get to the secret exit, you must have either gotten the red switch
palace or jump off of Yoshi's back to get the brick, but then you must
lose Yoshi to get up if you don't have the red switch palace gotten.

Normal Exit:
Head right into the pipe. Grab the Starman, and hurry right before the
lava fries you. Continue right, and watch out for the spiny enemies.
The goal is not much further to the right.

================
=Vanilla Dome 2=
================

Go right into the water. Navigate the water until you get to the right.
Go up the vine, and continue until you find an arrow pointing down and
go down there.

Secret Exit: Go up and left, and run left. Use the switch at the solid
wall. Fall down, and get the key. Go around the fishes down below to
the keyhole.

Normal Exit: Go right instead. Watch out for the charging chucks, and
get a Starman from the changing block. Hit the switch, and blaze right
to the goal.

===================
=Red Switch Palace=
===================

Hit the switch, then quickly go up above and make the rainbow shell
defeat all the Koopas for you and gain you an extra life. Now just go
into the pipe and step on the large switch.

=====================
=Vanilla Ghost House=
=====================

Go right, and dodge ghosts along the way. At the block part, where
there is a little gap between blocks, the third block to the bottom has
a vine in it. Go up, and go all the way right and down to a door. Dodge
the green balls (you can spin jump and ride them across though) and
grab the switch that is in yellow blocks. Go up to the coins in the
outline of a door, get the coins, and step on the switch to make the
door open up to the goal.

================
=Vanilla Dome 3=
================

Pretty self-explanatory, as many of the levels are. When you get to a
pipe, there is a secret block just to the left to allow access up
there. Keep going forward into the level, until you get to the next
skeleton platform. Quickly get past here before you miss your ride. You
can go into the yellow pipe for some coins and an powerup. At the part
with another ride and many piranha plants, you must act quickly to get
on your ride again in time. This will lead you right up to the goal.

================
=Vanilla Dome 4=
================

There is no need to describe this level at all. Just requires skill to
dodge all the bullets around. When you get to a yellow pipe with a
piranha plant in it, bullets will come out of everywhere on the screen
and are nearly impossible to dodge. Run as fast as you can to the goal.

============================
=Castle #3 Lemming's Castle=
============================

This level can be quite frustrating. Wait for a magician to break a
brick from below, and go down. When you get to the water, stomp the
magician. Jump up along the blocks, and step on the switch. Go as fast
as you can to the right where the door is waiting. Go into the next
door, and this is pretty hard here too. Find out the pattern of the
blocks, and quickly get in and out the areas before getting fried by
the lava. When you find a mushroom, you are safe where that is. Lemming
is pretty easy. One of the enemies that pops up is him. You can tell
because he looks different than the two fake ones. 3 hits on the real
Lemming will knock him into the lava, and you have beaten it.

==================
=Vanilla Secret 1=
==================

Climb up the level, and go up vines along the way.

Secret Exit:
When at a part with lots of Koopas, fly up to the left (to the left of
the Koopas) and go into the pipe and go up and right to the goal.

Normal Exit: When at the part with lots of Koopas, time your jump so
you get up there without getting hit. Now go up and left and get to the
goal.

==================
=Vanilla Secret 2=
==================

Head right, and do not defeat any of the Koopas, as you will regret it.
Go right all the way until you come up to a pit filled with spines. The
second block from the left houses a switch. Bring it back all the way
left to the piranha plants coming out of pipes, and step on it. Race
left, trying to get all the coins. You will get around 40 lives or
more. This is the best way in the game to get lives. Go back where the
spines are, and head right. Go into the pipe near the huge pipe.

==================
=Vanilla Secret 3=
==================

Very simple level. Just go right, trying to stay up in the air. Watch
out for the enemy in the water, but believe it or not Yoshi can swallow
that huge enemy. Head right to the pipe that leads to the end.

==================
=Vanilla Fortress=
==================

Follow the path right. If small, go into the area to the bottom. Watch
out for the brown spikes as they fall when you get near them. All the
way right is a pipe, go in. Now just keep heading right, watching out
for enemies and chain spikes. The boss is pretty easy to beat. Hit a
block under 2-3 of them, and then jump onto one of the blocks before
you get fried below and finish off the last couple of them.

=====================
=  World 4: Bridge  =
=====================

=================
=Butter Bridge 1=
================= `

Just follow the way that the screen goes and you'll be fine. At the end
is a pipe that leads to the goal.

=================
=Butter Bridge 2=
=================

Very easy. Just get a cape if you don't already have one, and fly
through the entire level to the end.

====================
=Cheese Bridge Area=
====================

Extremely easy. Make sure you have Yoshi and a cape. Just take a
running jump to the right, and hold right and the jump button and you
will bounce all around and not have to do anything but hold the jump
button and right. Now jump again from here, and super jump once again
after you land to get to the end.

Secret Exit:
Float down under the goal and jump off of Yoshi under the goal to the
right to find the secret goal.

Normal Exit:
Just head right and finish the stage.

===========
=Soda Lake=
===========

This level is best done with Yoshi. You can stay up on the ceiling of a
torpedo and the torpedoes won't do anything to you. Just carefully
navigate the waters to the right where the pipe leading to the goal is.

=================
=Cookie Mountain=
=================

As always, you can just fly through the level. If not, just be careful
of all the enemies that rain fire from the blocks. A very
straightforward level clear up to the end so you shouldn't need any
help here.

============================
=Castle #4: Ludwig's Castle=
============================

Start by going right and dodging spikes and enemies. You are safe in
corners if you crouch. When you get to the door, jump into the little
square shaped block just to the left. You should go through it. Go up
and right, and into the pipe for a bonus round. After you are done here
you will appear in an area with spikes coming down. Head left as fast
as possible, and then hit the switch at the last second to raise up the
spikes. Go left as fast as possible before getting killed by the
spikes, but watch out for fireballs. In this room, you need to get up
to the top to the boss door, but you can gain some more lives by
stomping a lot of Koopas. To defeat Ludwig, stomp on him, and then wait
for him to stop spinning in his shell. Then you can hit him again, etc.
Three hits is all it takes.

===============================
= World 5: Forest of Illusion =
===============================

======================
=Forest of Illusion 1=
======================

Head right until you find a spring. Get it, and bring it to the right
where you see a lot of music blocks. Hit the yellow block, and bounce
of the spring and then super jump off of Yoshi (very difficult to get
this 1-up without Yoshi) and grab the life. Continue right, get a
Starman, and get lots of lives here.

Secret Exit:
After defeating all those enemies, drop down and hit the block to make
Mario a balloon. Go left, and use the key in the keyhole to get the
secret exit.

Normal Exit:
Just continue right, the exit isn't much farther.

====================
=Forest Ghost House=
====================

Head right, and watch out for ghosts and the big boo. Continue right to
the door. When continuing right, you will find a switch. Grab it, and
go all the way right. Step on it, and go into the door.

Normal Exit:
Go into the first door you see.

Fake Exit:
Go into the second door you find.

======================
=Forest of Illusion 2=
======================

Follow the path, and be careful of those water spike guys. When you get
about halfway through the level or so and there is a yellow block in
the lower left corner.

Secret Exit:
Go through the wall to the left of this block, and here is the exit.

Normal Exit:
Just continue to the right, and the goal is waiting for you.

====================
=Blue Switch Palace=
====================

Go right, and collect a couple coins there. Now step on both switches,
and quickly go up and grab all the coins. Now just go into the pipe to
the switch.

======================
=Forest of Illusion 3=
======================

Just go right until you find a charging chuck.

Secret Exit:
When you find him, the green pipe near him you can enter. Destroy the
blocks and use the key.

Normal Exit:
Just head right and the goal is there.

======================
=Forest of Illusion 4=
======================

Grab the life, and then shoot Likatu and ride the cloud as long as you
can. Then, when he comes back, ride him again.

Secret Exit:
Land on the pipe, and go in. Another way is to time your jump off of
the jumping Koopa to the right onto the pipe.

Normal Exit:
Just keep heading right to get to the goal.

*Glitch*
You can stay in the cloud forever if you go up as high as you can, so
you can fly through the whole level.

====================
=Forest Secret Area=
====================

Extremely straightforward. Just stay on the platforms, and at the end
if you have enough things on the screen you will get 3 lives.

=================
=Forest Fortress=
=================

Watch out for the pistons and grinders. Time your moves so either won't
hit you. In the next room, you need to be careful of lava and yet more
blades. If you are cape Mario and you are good at flying, go above the
red door and fly above the fireballs to the right with lots of 1-ups.
Now go into the door. Use the same strategy you did last time, and
you've beaten this level.

=========================
=Castle #5: Roy's Castle=
=========================

Stay on the moving platform, and watch out for fireballs. Keep on it,
and watch out for the brown spikes. When you get to a switch, step on
it and grab the life. Now carefully jump from block to block here to
the boss. This boss is very easy, just stomp him three times in a row,
one after the other.

================================
= World 6: Chocolate Island    =
================================

====================
=Chocolate Island 1=
====================

Simple level. There are a couple pipes that shoot you out of the big
one. The last one you will need to hold both the A and B buttons to get
to the other side, where the goal is.

===================
=Choco-Ghost House=
===================

Go right, and watch out for the pits and the ghost likatu. Go into the
door, and jump off the boo blocks to get to the door. To do this, make
them follow you near the door, and face them to turn them to blocks.
The door leads to the goal.

====================
=Chocolate Island 2=
====================

This level shouldn't pose any trouble.

For Exit 1:
Go into the pipe, and finish this area with 250 or more seconds left on
the timer.

For Exit 2: Have a little bit less than 250 seconds on the timer before
finishing the area you go into from the pipe.

====================
=Chocolate Island 3=
====================

Pretty straight forward. Just follow the moving platforms to the end of
the level.

Fake Exit: Just go up the vine.

Real Exit: Fly under the exit to the right for the real goal, or jump
off of Yoshi to get to the right of it.

====================
=Chocolate Fortress=
====================

This level is pure skill, so a walkthrough here wouldn't do much good.
Time your jumps very carefully, and have patience. It really helps to
have a cape too. When you get to the end, you know how to defeat the
boss.

====================
=Chocolate Island 4=
====================

Be careful on the platforms, because if you fall down you will die.
When you can go down after a dragon coin, go down and get the lives. Go
right, and hit the third yellow block from the left for a switch. Hit
it, and go into the pipe. Get the switch here, and fall all the way
down. Now fly up to the 2nd level for 3 lives, and go in the pipe (you
can get the other items if you want). Now go right to the goal.

====================
=Chocolate Island 5=
====================

Not a difficult stage. Just go right until you find a changing power up
block, then eat it when it is a Starman, and blaze through the level.
At the midway gate, jump across moving pipes to the goal.

===========================
=Castle #6: Wendy's Castle=
===========================

Finally, a challenge. This level ranks up as one of the hardest stages
in the game. One word of advice: Take your steps slow and carefully!
Watch out for those killer spikes! They will kill you if they squish
you head on. It's better to get hit by the blades than to die. When you
get to a bunch of blocks, jump around the first one clockwise, and if
you did it right a 1-up will pop up. Keep going, and you come to spikes
that are extremely quick. If you make it, there's a save point. Now,
this next part is a lot easier. Just wait for the right time to jump on
platforms and make it all the way to the boss door. Wendy isn't too
bad, but you do have to worry about two fireballs this time. You should
know how to beat this boss, as she is very like the 3rd boss, lemming.

==================
=Chocolate Secret=
==================

Get all the way right while dodging charging chucks. When you enter the
pipe, just hold the down button on the slopes, and then enter the pipe.
Here, you must go right as quickly as you can across falling yellow
platforms. You will just barely make it across before frying. The pipe
leads to the goal.

===================
=Sunken Ghost Ship=
===================

This level Yoshi can actually come to. Go into the yellow pipe to the
right, and take your time here as many ghosts appear. When you finally
make it to the other side, go into the pipe. Get the star, and try to
land on the platform to the right that has another Starman in it. Fall
to the water on the right, and quickly go down and get the two 1-ups
and then swim back up. Grab that ball to finish the stage.

=============================
= World 7: Valley of Bowser =
=============================

====================
=Valley of Bowser 1=
====================

The fastest way through this level is to follow this pattern through
the maze: Up, down, up, and go all the way down from here and watch out
for charging chucks. Now just follow the path down and right to the
goal.

====================
=Valley of Bowser 2=
====================

Exit #1: Go right all the way to the pipe. The block has wings in it,
which can only be used if you have Yoshi. Go up, and get all the stuff
here and fall down to finish the level.

Exit #2: This time ignore the wings, and if you have Yoshi, you must
ignore him, as you can't do this with him. Take your time between
moving or you will be squished. When you get to the other side and the
pipe, watch out as this floor goes up. When you get past here, fly over
the left wall over to the left where the key and keyhole is.

Exit #3: This one is pointless, but to get to it just continue right
from exit #2.

=================
=Valley Fortress=
=================

Probably the hardest stage in the game. First, have two capes (one in
reserve.) When you start, race to the green block and wait to continue
right. The next part you have to be quick. The next part you have to be
ultra quick, take your time to move over at the right time. When you
make it to the end you know how to defeat the reznors. Your reward is
being able to go at the back door, which allows you to start near the
end of bowser's castle.

====================
=Valley Ghost House=
====================

Start by going into the first door all the way to the right. Hit the
switch, and race right as fast as you can.

Exit #1:
Go into the second door from the right.

Exit #2:
Go into the last door. Grab the switch, and go right to a block. Hit
it, and make a little stairway to the top. Don't make it too low, or it
won't be high enough. Don't make it too high, either. If you are caped
you can fly up, and crouch while falling back down then rapidly jump to
get in. If not, after making the coin stairway, step on the switch and
go up to the key and keyhole.

==========================
=Castle #7 Larry's Castle=
==========================

If you are excellent in flying, fly around the whole level to the
right. If not, just ride the block right. Fall down the pit down below,
and get the stuff. Try to stay caped through the level. Here are those
magician enemies, so watch out. If you are caped, you can destroy the
blocks and not have to wait for the magician guys to do it for you.
Once over to the right, the boss awaits. Larry is just like the first
boss you fought, only with three fireballs on the screen this time.

====================
=Valley of Bowser 3=
====================

Not a very challenging stage. The blocks indicate how long they move
before they fall down. Example: 4's last for four seconds. When you
find two yellow pipes, you can enter the bottom. After this part have
some more blocks (not all time ones though) and banzai bills coming at
you. After this is the goal.

====================
=Valley of Bowser 4=
====================

Take your time, and watch out for digging chucks. The pipe after a
series of platforms and lava you can go into for an ice area. Later on,
you can get Yoshi.

Secret Exit: Keep Yoshi to the end. Eat the key, and go into the
keyhole with it in your mouth.

Normal Exit: Just head right to the goal.

=================
=Bowser's Castle=
=================

Front Door:
Room #1:
Fairly hard, you must dodge fireballs and pistons at the same time.
Extremely hard without gotten all of the switch palaces.

Room #2:
This is one of the easiest. Just get into the background, and you can't
be hurt except from the Koopas. You can even gain a life from them all.

Room #3:
Not very difficult, but it is a maze. At the upper left corner is a
hidden 1-up.

Room #4:
Not tough. Just follow the blocks to the other side.

From any of the rooms, you will appear to the next four.

Room #5:
Run for your life as soon as the first spike goes up to the other side.

Room #6:
An underwater area with many skeletons and spikes and ball and chains.
Not a recommended area to do, as it's long and fairly difficult.

Room #7:
You have to dodge many silver and jumping gold Bowser statues. Fairly
hard.

Room #8:
A room filled with charging chucks. This room isn't too hard,
especially if you are caped.

Note: The front door one ends up here after the other rooms, and the
back door entrance starts here.

Head right after hitting the switch to help you see, using the mecha
Koopas to defeat enemies along the way.

Bowser strategy:
Wait until he shoots two mecha Koopas, and try to throw them up so that
it bonks him on the head with them. After you do this twice, he runs
away. Stand in between flames, and then the princess will give you a
mushroom. Now Bowser shoots a couple of bowling balls that you must
either jump over or spin jump around. Then he fires two more mecha
Koopas, which you know what to do with. More flames, and another
mushroom comes. Now he is really angry. He starts pounding into the
ground, which will hurt you. He occasionally will fire mecha Koopas,
which you must use to hit him quickly before he finishes you off. Two
more hits and you've won the game!

==============
= Star World =
==============

Note that the normal exits for the most part here do nothing, but I
will cover them anyway.

==============
=Star World 1=
==============

This has to be the easiest level in the whole game.

Secret Exit:

Just go all the way to the right, spin jump, and Mario does all the
work for you and you will appear next to the keyhole and the key.

Normal Exit:
Just bust away all the bricks and go all the way to the bottom of the
stage, then go to the pipe to the right and get to the goal.

==============
=Star World 2=
==============

Another extremely easy stage. Grab the Starman and the baby Yoshi, then
race right and hit the block to get another Starman. Eat a few enemies
to get a full-grown blue Yoshi, the best of them all.

Secret Exit:
When you see the pipe, fall down a bit and go along the bottom area
until you get all the way right. Eat the key, then go into the keyhole
to beat the level.

Normal Exit:
Just go into the pipe to get to the normal exit.

==============
=Star World 3=
==============

Yet another very small and easy stage.

Normal Exit:
Just head right for the goal.

Secret Exit:
Jump on the switch, and if you have Yoshi, jump off and throw a block
at likatu, then jump back on. Go up the blocks and jump on the cloud.
Fly up, and go left for the key, and right for the keyhole.

==============
=Star World 4=
==============

The secret exit is very easy with blue Yoshi, and if you don't have him
you will either have to have gotten many of the switch palaces or be
cape Mario. Nothing much to explain except that once you get to the
pipe where a Koopa is kicking a shell, you have two ways to go
depending whether you want to get one or the other exit.

Secret Exit:
Fly down (remember it is much easier with blue Yoshi) and time your
spit so that the shell hits the block to reveal the key.

Normal Exit:
Keep going right, jumping over the gaps and platforms along the way to
the goal.

==============
=Star World 5=
==============

In this level you actually want to get both exits.

Secret Exit:
If you haven't beaten all the switch palaces yet, you must use blue
Yoshi and fly up to the upper right corner of the level. First you must
fly through a lot of the level. Make sure you have a green Koopa in
your mouth, then spit it out, and eat it again to get enough time to
fly all the way right to the key and keyhole.

Normal Exit:
Do what you did for the secret exit, except keep going right and
continue going right. You will eventually find the goal.

To get to the Special World, go the star road in the center.

=================
= Special World =
=================

If you are bored and want to listen to cool music, let the game stand
still for a while on this world map. Eventually it will start making a
remix of super Mario brothers 1 music.

=================
=Stage 1: Gnarly=
=================

Go up the vines, and grab the switch in the left yellow block. Carry it
up above, and at the big drop step on it. Fall right and onto the
blocks and go into the pipe. Get the coins and lives to the right, and
jump up. Step on the gray switch, then step on one of the others. Grab
the other with you, and step on it as the other is about to run out
(but continue right) and defeat the fly hammer brother. Go right to the
goal.

=========
=Tubular=
=========

This is no doubt the hardest level in the game. Step on the switch to
the right, fall onto the spring, and become balloon Mario. Now go
right, and get the topmost right block for more air. Dodge the Koopas
and plants, and continue. In this part, you must get under the chuck
and hit the block under him for more air. Now just fly right to the
end. Sound easy? Well try it and you'll see why it's so hard.

==========
=Way Cool=
==========

Get on, and get the third switch you see. Hit the next one too, and go
into the yellow pipe at the end of the ride. Now, if you didn't use the
pipe you will have to go through this hard part to the right. If you
did, you will have Yoshi, and the block has wings in it. Get all the
coins, and fall into the pit to finish the stage.

=========
=Awesome=
=========

Another hard level. Make sure you have Yoshi. Save the switch, eat it
to bring it with you and spit it out a lot so you won't swallow it.
When you get to coins in the air, use it. Get the Starman, and race. If
you are falling in the pit, jump off of Yoshi to save yourself. Try to
save this toward the end, because it is nearly impossible to jump this
far. To the right is the goal.

========
=Groovy=
========

Just head right until you find a Starman. Get as far as you can with
this, and you will be near the goal. It takes great skill to be able to
get all the coins from the cloud. Past the huge pipe is the goal, not
far away.

=======
=Mondo=
=======

Wait for the water to rise and come down, then go right and defeat the
flying hammer brother. Just go right, and don't bother to get
everything unless you want to. Watch out for those hammer brothers, as
they are everywhere. You should do fine. At the end is a pipe, which
leads to the goal.


============
=Outrageous=
============

This level should seem familiar. Use your same tactics here, only there
are fire snakes and bullets going everywhere. Believe it or not, Yoshi
can eat the flames. About halfway through, you must bring a spring with
you to a very tall pipe. The end is pretty hard, you must quickly get
on the hammer brother's block and jump to the goal before you get too
badly hurt by the cannons.

=======
=Funky=
=======

This level isn't too bad. Make sure you have Yoshi though. Those green
apples give you 20 extra seconds. In the music block area, the upper
right most has a Starman. Race as fast as you can, and then a bit more
to the right you will find an interesting thing. At the end coins in
form of letters spell "YOU ARE A SUPER PLAYER!!" and then the end of
the level. Congratulations! Your reward you are asking? Go into that
star road to find out!

If you get 100 points then you get to play a bonus level!

Star
They make Mario invincible.

3-Up Moon
They will give Mario three extra lives.

Jumping Board
Time it right and you can do a super high jump.

Yoshi's Wings
Yoshi can fly if you take these when Mario's riding Yoshi.

Feather
Make Mario Caped Mario

Mushroom
Make Mario Super Mario

Flower
Make Mario Fire Mario.

Jump Block
You can bounce of these blocks and sometimes throughout items.

Switch Block
This block turns certain objects coins and vice-versa.

Message Block
This gives you hints and advice during the game.

Egg
Yoshi will come out of here and if you already have Yoshi a 1-up
Mushroom will come out.

1-Up Mushroom
These mushrooms will give you an extra life.

Berry
Yoshi can swallow these they count as one coin.

Coins
If you collect 100 coins you will get an extra life.

Dragon Coins
Gather 5 of these in one course and you will get an extra life. They
also count as regular coins.

Power Balloon
Mario's body will swell up when he has these, which will allow him to
drift through the sky for a fixed amount of time.

Prize Block
Hit this from beneath to get a coin or item. If a enemy is on top of
these when you hit it, it will cause damage.

Rotating Block
Hit this from beneath and it will rotate for a fixed amount of time. If
an enemy is on top of these when you hit it, it will cause damage. But
be careful enemies can drop through rotating blocks.

Grab Block
You can hold and throw this block to kill enemies or hit prize blocks.

Keys
If you see a keyhole then you know there's a key somewhere. Quickly
find it and it will lead you either to a different part of the level a
secret level or even a bonus level.
Bonus Block
If you get 30 coins in one course, punch it to get an extra 1-up
mushroom.

Exclamation Blocks
You need to fill these in with the switch palaces, but when you do you
can get great items out of them or they might be stairs to awesome
levels.

=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

Here's a list of basic enemies you will face.

Koopa:
The same old Koopas are back again. Everything seems bleak when these
characters appear! If you jump on a Koopa in this game, it pops out of
its shell. And what's worse is that an unshelled will eventually fill
its empty shell and climb back to start all over again. BEWARE! If
Koopa climbs into a yellow shell he'll become invincible!

Super Koopa:
A Koopa that can fly once it has put on the magic cape. It looks like
these guys might give Caped Mario some tough aerial combat. But look at
the bright side...if you jump on one that's wearing a flashing cape,
you'll get a cape feather.

Jumpin' Piranha Plant:
These are a tropical plant version of the Volcano Plant! Be careful;
they come madly whirling out of the pipes and can be very tough.

Goomba:
Jump on it to make it roll. You can also hold it or throw it.

Monty Mole:
This is a mole that bursts out of the ground. There's even bigger ones
underground.

Boo Buddies And The Big Boo:
You may remember the Boo Buddies from Super Mario Brothers 3. This time
there's a whole heard of them! And amongst them there's a huge spook
called The Big Boo. But don't worry, if you look at them, they act shy
and turn away. Cute, aren't they? But watch it...they're dangerous!

Eeries:
This is a dinosaur spook that roams the haunted house. It comes after
you with its pale face and ohhhhh, what a ghastly spook it is!

Rip Van Fish:
This little fellow is always taking a nap, but when Mario comes along,
he wakes up, and sets off in hot pursuit. Whatever you do, don't let
Rip touch Mario!

Urchin:
This is a great giant urchin drifting in the sea. It doesn't move very
fast, so if you swim by carefully, they should be no problem. However,
it's probably really painful if you get stung.

Rex:
As one would expect, you could only meet this kind of enemy in dinosaur
land, and there are lots of them too. You have to stomp on Rex twice to
defeat him. Rex has wings, but I don't think he can fly.

Mini-Rhino And Dino Rhino:
These are dragons from Chocolate Island. Jump on Dino-Rhino and it
becomes Mini-Rhino. Watch out they breathe fire.

Bob-omb:
These explode and scatter stars after a set time. Some of the Bob-ombs
use parachutes to drop from the sky. These little guys are a real
blast.

Thwomp:
A nasty stone ghost that guards the castles and fortresses for the
Koopas. If Mario comes close, Thwomp will try to crush him. The trouble
is, if you pass it, you can't go on.

Wiggler:
A caterpillar that lives in the forest. Normally Wiggler is very quiet,
but once jumped on, Wiggler turns red and gets extremely angry. If
possible, treat wiggler with respect.

Magikoopa:
This is one of the tortoise sorcerers. The strange of light that shoot
from the wand are able to change blocks into enemies. On top of this,
Magikoopa can appear and disappear in an instant. A tough customer to
deal with!

Sumo Brother:
When this strange little fellow stomps its foot, lightning strikes, and
turns whatever it hits into flames, BEWARE! Sumo Brother will even
attack you with a karate chop!

Chargin' Chuck:
These All-Stars always seem to bar Mario's way just when he's within
sight of the goal. They use a variety of bull-headed attacks, so you'll
really have a tough time checking Chargin' Chuck.

A multi player game is much easier than a 1-player game. You can
exchange lives too. Here's how.
If you press L or R at the map screen, the screen on the right will
appear. This screen also appears if one of the players finishes the
game. When this appears, you can give some of your Marios (or Luigis)
to the other player.

When you're only using one controller, press B to give one of Luigi's
lives to Mario; press A to give one of Mario's lives to Luigi.

When you're using two controllers, player 2 (with controller 2) can
press B to give one of Luigi's lives to Mario and Y to give one of
Mario's lives to Luigi. Press START to return to the original screen.

 ______________________
|How to save your game.|
When you clear areas like a castle, fortress or haunted house, the
following choices will appear on the map screen:
*Continue and Save
*Continue Without Save
If you choose to continue and save, the route up that point will be
saved in the Save Slot you selected has been saved, it doesn't matter
if you switch the POWER switch OFF, because it is saved on the Game
Pak. If you want to end the game in the same status as you started,
select CONTINUE WITHOUT SAVE and then continue with the game. (Your
extra Marios will not be saved.)

When the game is over, the following choices will appear on the map
screen:
*Continue
*End
If you select "End" you'll return to the Title Screen. If you select
"Continue," you'll begin on the course immediately after the last saved
point.

When all three save slots have been used, you can delete the data in
one on the slots by selecting "Delete Saved Route" at the Title Screen.
And after selecting and restarting a save slot, you can choose to play
the game as a 1-player game or a 2-player game. (The number displayed
in the save slot is the number of areas you've found up to the point
when you saved.)
 ____________
|Losing Lives|
When you lose all your lives the game is over.

You lose one life:
*When Small Mario is touched or bitten by an enemy.
*When Mario falls into a hole.
*When Mario does not reach the goal before the timer reaches zero.
*When Mario gets pushed off the screen (in the automatic scrolling
areas).

If you are Fire Mario, Caped Mario or Super Mario, being touched or
bitten by an enemy will transform you back to regular Mario.

At the start of the game press START and the save slots for Mario A,
Mario B, and Mario C will appear.
Use SELECT to choose one of the slots and also whether it is a 1-player
game or 2-player game. Then press START to start the game. The game
consists of map screens and action screens.

MAP SCREEN:
Top left: Mario's current status.
Top: Current course.
Somewhere on map: Mario's location.

The game begins at Yoshi's house. Move Mario (or Luigi) by using the
Directional Pad. At first, Mario can only go left or right from Yoshi's
House. However, once it Mario has cleared some of the areas he will be
able to move farther along. No go for it!
If you wish to see the rest of the map press the START button and the
Directional Pad to scroll the screen. Press the Start button again to
return to where you were. (NOTE: This can't be done in world one but
can be done in later worlds.)
Some points on the map are red. These areas have a normal goal and a
special goal (or secret keyhole). If you find the goal, a new route
will appear on the map. Many of these new rotes can appear as a
shortcut.

ACTION SCREEN:
Top left: Number of lives.
Top left next to number of live: Number of Dragon Coins you have
collected so far on that course.
Top left next to number of Dragon Coins: Number of points.
Top center: Stored item. (Which you can get by collecting another item,
you can use this by pressing the SELECT button or the item
automatically drops when an enemy hits you.)
Top right: Number of coins.
Top right below number of coins: Score.
Top right next to stored item: Timer.

Press B or Y while on the map to enter an area. If you can get Mario to
the end of the goal safely, the area will be cleared. Once an area is
cleared, you can return there as many as you wish (except for castles
and fortresses, which can only be cleared once). If you go into an area
that has already been cleared, you can return to the map screen by
pressing START then SELECT.

Version: .1 - 5/14/01
This is the first and probably last version of this great Mario game.

Version: .2 - 6/20/01
We got rid of that ugly ASCII art, we also re-formatted parts of the
guide. This will be the last update.

Version: .3 - 3/20/02
Our last version of this guide, major reformatting done. Enjoy the
guide!

Version: .4 - 5/14/02
Okay, we swear this will be the last version of this guide; we had to
do a major reformat job though. Oh, by the way, today is this guide's
anniversary, it's been a whole year since the first version of this
guide was sent in, we appreciate all the positive feedback we have seen
from our readers, and we hope we can produce more guides in the future
that will help people as much as this guide has.

Version: Final - 1/6/03
Okay, last version, we promise! We just needed to do a format change.
