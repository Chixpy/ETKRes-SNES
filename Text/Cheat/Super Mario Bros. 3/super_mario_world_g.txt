                               ----------------
===============================================================================

Hello and welcome to the Super Mario World FAQ/Walkthrough. Within this 
document I will tell you just about all there is to this game, including how
to complete the game, get all 96 levels and use all of Mario's moves to their
full extent. I hope that this will help you in one way or another. 

This is perhaps my all time favourite platform game, and by far the best Mario.
After the awesome NES Mario games, Mario returned as a launch game for the
SNES, and wowed everyone with its great graphics and even better gameplay. This
game is very big, with 96 levels and 2 secret worlds to discover, and with
a new character, Yoshi, this game set new standards for platformers and remains
a firm favourite for many.

NOTE: If you are planning on printing this FAQ out, then head over to the
enemy listing if you want to print out images of the enemies to help you
recognising the enemies there. Thanks to Trace (Meowthnum1) on advising me to
do this.

 2.01. Story
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is the story of Super Mario World. Note that this is copied directly from
the manual and so are not my own words. Also thanks to
www.world-of-nintendo.com for having the manual online, as my manual is in the
loft somewhere and so I couldn't get the story directly from my own source.

-

After saving the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser and the rest of the Koopa's in
Super Mario 3, Mario and Luigi needed to recuperate from their adventures.
Together they agreed that the best place to vacation was a magical place
called Dinosaur Land.

But while Mario and Luigi reclined on the beach for a relaxing nap, Princess
Toadstool disappeared, apparently seized by evil forces. After searching for
hours for their missing friend, Mario and Luigi came upon an enormous egg in
the forest.

Suddenly the egg hatched, and out popped a young dinosaur named YOSHI, who
proceeded to tell Mario and Luigi a sad tale of how his dinosaur pals who
were sealed in similar eggs by a group of monsterous turtles.

"Monsterous turtles!," exclaimed Luigi. "Bowser and his bunch have
returned!" Mario slowly nodded his head in agreement and, along with Luigi
and Yoshi, set off across Dinosaur Land to find the Princess and to free
Yoshi's friends. As they began their journey, Yoshi handed Mario a beautiful
cape. "This may help you," Yoshi said. "Some say it has magical powers."

With a little luck (and help from a magic cape), our hearty crew can defeat
the seven worlds of Bowser's Krazy Koopa Kritters. Many locations are
well-hidden so explore everywhere and try everything. Not all locations have
to be explored to rescue the dinosaurs and save Princess Toadstool, but
there are many "starry" treasures to be found in far-reaching places. You'll
need to search all areas to find out what kinds of treasure are there... in
Super Mario World.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 2.02. Characters 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are the characters that are in the game, some playable, some not.

-----
Mario
-----

The main man, he returns for another great adventure! With his brother, Luigi,
he sets out to get Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser and to rescue
the dinosaurs (who are Yoshi's friends) from the Koopa Kids in the seven
castles in Dinosaur Land. Can he hack it?

-----
Luigi
-----

Mario's green wearing brother, he tags along on Mario's adventure to be of aid.
You play as him if you are the second player in a two player game. Sort of the
rejected hero of the game. Poor guy.

------------------
Princess Toadstool
------------------

She gets kidnapped while on her holiday in Dinosaur Land by Bowser (again).
Mario and the Princess are probably in love or something. THAT's why Mario is
rescuing her. Or it's for a ransom.

-----
Yoshi
-----

The long-tongued dinosaur's debut, he helps Mario on his quest, as his seven
friends are captured along with Princess Toadstool. Mario can ride him and with
his moves, he will be of great use during the game. More green than Luigi.
Has more games than Luigi. More popular than Luigi.


----------
Koopa Kids
----------

The Koopa Kids each have one of Yoshi's friends captured in an egg within
the seven castles across Dinosaur Land. Defeat them to rescue the dinos!

------
Bowser
------

The main baddie of the Mario games, he returns and kidnaps Princess Toadstool
again. But where in Dinosaur Land is he...?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 2.03. Basics
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

If you have ever played a 2D Mario game, then you should know the score here,
but there are some new features. You start on a map, where you can move around
to different levels (only the ones either side of Yoshi's House at first).
Pressing B or Y on a level makes you enter the level. The aim of every level is
to reach the end goal within the time limit, where once you have completed the
level you will open up a new path on the map to more level/s. You can re-enter
the levels you have completed if you wish. Some levels (as seen on the map)
are red, which means that they have a normal and secret exit (more about that
later though). Also on the map, pressing Start means that you can view the
entire map. Use the D-Pad to look around it, and when you are done press
Start again to return to where you were. Note that you cannot do that in the
first world, Yoshi's Island.

-----------
Midway Gate
-----------

Half way through most (if not all) levels is a Midway Gate. This is a 
checkpoint, and breaking the tape here means that if you die after this point
you start here, as opposed to starting the entire level again. Also if you are
small Mario, going through the gate means that you become Super Mario. Sweet. 

-------------------
Goal and Bonus Game
-------------------

At the end of each level is a giant gate with a moving tape. If you enter the
gate, you complete the level. If you complete the level while riding Yoshi, you
get to start the next level with him. Also, breaking the tape means that you
can earn stars. The higher the tape is, the more stars you get. Stars are
carried on across levels, and when you reach 100 stars you play a Bonus Game.
The Bonus Game is played similar to Tic-Tac-Toe. The boxes are changing
pictures. When hit from underneath, the picture stays the same. Getting a row
of the same picture earns you a 1-Up Green Mushroom.

---------------
Goal Item Bonus
---------------

When you travel through the Goal at the level's exit, you can receive a bonus
according to what status Mario is in, and what powerup he has reserved in the
Item Stock. Here is a chart of what you can get -

                ITEM STOCK POWERUP
          +-----------------------------+
          |     |Empty|Mushr|FireF|Feath|
          |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
          |Mini |  M  |  1  |  M  |  M  |          M  =  Mushroom
  MARIO'S |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   FORM   |Super|  M  |  1  |  M  |  M  |          F  =  Fire Flower
          |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
          |Fire |  F  |  F  |  1  |  F  |          C  =  Cape Feather
          |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
          |Cape |  C  |  C  |  C  |  1  |          1  =  1-Up Green Mushroom
          +-----------------------------+

Also, if you take a baby Yoshi or a Key through the exit with you, you will
get a 1-Up Green Mushroom. A big thanks to http://www.classicgaming.com/tmk/
for all the information on the Goal Item Bonus's.

--------------
Switch Palaces
--------------

During that game, you will bound to come across blocks that are nothing but
coloured dotted lines. There are four different colours of these; Yellow, Red,
Blue and Green. At four different switch palaces, you can activate these dotted
blocks into ! blocks permanently. At a yellow switch palace, you change the
yellow dotted blocks into yellow ! blocks, at the red switch palace you change
the red dotted blocks into red ! blocks etc. The switch palaces, apart from
Yellow, are well hidden and require searching for. They are of use during the
game, as the red and blue blocks fill up certain gaps to make them shorter and
the yellow and green blocks give you powerups at times when you will most
probably need them.

-----------------
Defeating enemies
-----------------

You will encounter a large range of enemies during the adventure, and so Mario
has to defeat them in some way. Some enemies, such as the Koopa, can be
defeated when jumped on. Mario, when he has collected the fire flower, can
throw fireballs at them, or you can throw items (like a koopa shell). Some
cannot be defeated however. Yoshi can also eat some enemies too. During the
walkthrough it will say how to defeat certain enemies as you meet them, and
also at the enemy listing towards in the end of the guide.

-----
Coins
-----

Golden Coins are littered around in the levels in the game. These are either
hovering in the air or in certain blocks (an enemy defeated by a fireball also
leaves a coin). When you collect 100 of these coins, you get an extra life.

------------
Dragon Coins
------------

Within most levels, there are 5 Dragon Coins. Collecting all these earns you
an extra life. Some level's even have 6, and collecting the 6th will get you
another life on top of the one you got for getting five. Collecting a Dragon
Coin also adds one to your normal coin total also.

-----
Lives
-----

Like most platform games, you have lives. Losing all of your lives means its
Game Over. You can earn more lives however, by collecting the 1-Up Green
Mushroom's, or getting 100 coins or 5 Dragon Coins. You can lose lives by when
touching an enemy (Small Mario only), falling in a hole or the time runs out.

------
Blocks
------

The good old block. There are different types of blocks throughout the game
that do different things. To use it, hit it from underneath.

 /------\   
 |  ?   |  - This block contains Items, such as coins and powerups.
 |      |
 \------/

 /------\   
 | |  | |  - This block when hit usually rotates and so can be passed through.
 |      |    They can also be holding an item. Also, spin jumping on these as
 \------/    Super Mario from above destroys them.

 /------\   
 | \  / |  - This block is brown in colour, and means that it has been used
 |      |    and has no use apart from being stepped on.
 \------/

 +------+
 |      |  - These are empty blocks. You can make them full by activating their
 |      |    colour at the corresponding Switch Palace.
 +------+

 /------\
 |  !   |  - These are blocks that have been activated by going to a Switch
 |      |    Palace. These are the same as the ? blocks.
 \------/

 /------\
 |  *   |  - This is a block that's green, and has a big white star in. If you
 |      |    hit it and you have 30 or above coins, you get a 1-Up green
 \------/    mushroom. If you haven't got that many coins, you don't.

 +-------+
 |. /-\ .|  - These when hit give you information.
 | |+++| |
 |. \-/ .|
 +-------+

 |------|  - These blocks are transparent with power-ups inside them, which
 | /    |    alternate every second. Hitting the block releases it, and it
 |/    /|    keeps alternating until you collect it. It changes from the
 |------|    Mushroom, Fire Flower, Feather Cape, to Starman, then repeats.

 /------\ - This block, of which is white and has a black musical note on, is
 |   |  |   invincible. You can hit it underneath to make it jump up (to hit
 |  0|  |   things above) as many times as you like, and they are quite bouncy
 \------/   too. They sometimes hold items.

----------
Item Stock
----------

At the top of the screen is a blue box outline. This is the item stock. When
you get a powerup that is the same or less powerful than the one you have
currently, it gets stored in the item stock automatically. When you lose
your power, the item drops from the box where Mario can collect it. Also
pressing Select drops the item from the Item Stock. For more information about
the power ups and their effects, go to section 2.05 Power-ups.

-----
Items
-----

These are items that Mario can collect or use. To collect, touch the item.

1-Up Green Mushroom
Gives Mario an extra life. These are usually found in mini-games, hidden or
hard to get blocks or from certain requirements.

3-Up Moon
Gives Mario three extra lives. These are very well hidden and are hard to get.

Starman
Makes Mario invincible for a short period of time. You can plough through
enemies and defeat them by just touching them (and get a chain of eight to
get a 1-Up). However falling into gaps and lava will still kill Mario though.

Yoshi Egg
Yoshi hatches out of these. If you already have Yoshi with you, then a 1-Up
Green Mushroom will appear from it instead.

Berry
These are on hedges, and are for feeding Yoshi. After Yoshi has had 10 reds, he
will produce a Red Mushroom. Eating two pink berries means he will poop out
a cloud that throws coins and goods down onto the area. If you then collect
eight of these goodies you will get a 1-Up Green Mushroom thrown at you. Nice!

Power Balloon
A balloon with P on it - makes Mario inflate and float for a short period of
time. Often needed to get to hidden or hard to reach areas and goodies.

Wings
When riding Yoshi, go into this item to give Yoshi Wings, which will warp to
a secret area. Completing this area takes you back to the map, but the level
will not be complete.

Key
Hold this key, and find a keyhole. Put the two together and you will unlock
the level's secret exit. More details of this can be found at 'Key and Keyhole'
at the end of the section.

--------
Switches
--------

There are three types of switches; A Blue P-Switch, a Silver P-Switch and
a Switch Palace switch. They are all activated by being jumped on. A Blue
P-Switch turns coins into brown used blocks for a short period of time, a
Silver P-Switch turns ANY nearby enemies into Silver coins, and a Switch Palace
Switch turns all the transparent blocks into ! blocks (of that colour) through
out Dinosaur Land.

----------------
Saving your game
----------------

You can only save your game when you have completed a castle, fortress,
haunted house or switch palace, where you will be given the chance to. Note
that it will only save your progress in the game, and not how many lives you
have got or what status Mario is in. Note that if you replay a ghost house
you are still prompted to save after you complete it, so this is good if
you want to save after doing a level or two and you haven't or cannot get to
a save position.

-------------
2-Player Game
-------------

When you have selected what game save you want to play on the main menu, you
get the choice if you want to play a 1 or 2 player game. If you play a 2 player
game, Player 1 gets to play a Mario, whereas Player 2 gets to play as Luigi.
If you can either play with one controller and switch every turn, or have
a controller each to play with. It is played as each player takes it in turns
to play through the levels. Note that if one player has gone through a midway
gate, the other player will start there also.

Pressing L and R on the map screen enables you to give lives to one another.
If you are playing with just one controller, pressing A gives a life from Mario
to Luigi, and pressing B gives a life from Luigi to Mario. With two controllers
its the same apart from instead of pressing A you press Y on the second
controller. When you are done, press Start.

-----
Yoshi
-----

Yoshi is found in eggs in the levels (which are often found in blocks). When
Yoshi has hatched, Mario can ride him by jumping on top of him. Using Yoshi's
tongue, he can eat enemies and spit them out into something different, of
which depends on the enemy that has been eaten. He can also eat berries. To
eat things, press X or Y, and to spit it out (when his mouth is full) pressing
X or Y again. For example, eating a green shell means that he spits out a green
shell, eating a red shell means he spits out fireballs, eating a yellow shell
will create sand cloud when hitting the floor, and eating a blue shell means he
can fly.

When Yoshi is injured, Mario jumps off and Yoshi's runs away. You can catch up
and jump back on it and carry on, however when Yoshi falls down a hole he
disappears until you find another egg. Also note that when you find a Yoshi egg
and Yoshi is already present, a 1-Up Green Mushroom will appear from the egg.
If you end a level with Yoshi present, then he carries onto the next stage.
Yoshi cannot enter fortresses, castles or ghost houses.

There are also different coloured Yoshi's to be found, which are little until
they are fed enemies, which makes them grow into normal Yoshi size. These have
different abilities according to their colour, and are the same when you eat
the coloured shell as normal Yoshi. They do these abilities regardless of what
shell is in their mouth; Red Yoshi spits fireballs, Yellow Yoshi makes sand
clouds and Blue Yoshi can fly for a short amount of time.

---------------
Key and Keyhole
---------------

These are, well, the key to unlocking the secret levels within the game. On the
map if a level is red in colour, then it has a normal and secret exit. The
secret exit unlocks another path, and the Key and Keyhole within the level
does this. Pick up the key and simply walk into the keyhole to access the
secret exit.

Moves
-----

Jump [B]
Pressing B makes Mario jump. Holding B after jumping on an enemy makes Mario
jump up higher.

Running [D-PAD + Y]
Pressing on the D-Pad makes Mario move, and holding Y when moving makes Mario
run.

Spin Jump [A]
Pressing A makes Mario spin jump. This is good for defeating tougher enemies
that you come across, and for smashing rotating blocks from above. The downside
is that you don't jump as high as you do with a normal jump.

Run Jump [D-PAD + Y, B]
Make Mario run in a direction, and when his arms are out to the side jump
to make Mario jump higher than he normally would. With a cape on, this makes
him soar into the sky.

Yoshi High Jump [RIDING YOSHI, B, A]
When riding Yoshi, jump normally (B) then press A to dismount to jump quite
high into the air. This is useful for when you need to make very high jumps,
or if you are falling to your doom you can jump up to safety (Yoshi will bite
the bullet though).

Holding an item [HOLD Y]
Stand next to an item and press and hold Y. As long as you hold Y you hold the
item, meaning you can run around and also swim. Let go of Y to drop the item.
Pressing a direction on the D-Pad when letting go throws the item.

Swimming [D-PAD + B]
In water, using the D-Pad and B (or A) you can swim. To get out of the water,
at the surface press Up on the D-Pad and B (or A).

Crouch [DOWN]
Pressing Down on the D-Pad makes Mario crouch, which is good for dodging enemy
fire or the enemy themselves. Crouching on a pipe sometimes makes Mario travel
down it.

Climbing onto a Fence / Rope [UP]
At a fence or rope, jump to it then press Up to hang onto it. You can punch the
fence by pressing the Y button, where you can knock enemies off on the other
side.

Opening doors [Y]
Pressing Y at a door opens it, and Mario travels through it. This also applys
to the doors when you are climbing fences.

Flying and using the Cape [CAPE FEATHER REQUIRED]
Run and jump to be propelled into the air; see section 2.05 Power-ups for the
details on the flying itself.

Throwing fireballs [FIRE FLOWER REQUIRED]
Press Y to throw a fireball ahead of you. See section 2.05 Power-ups for more
details on this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 2.05. Power-ups 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Mario can collect certain items during his adventure to power-up his status
and give him new abilities. Below is a chart of what Mario needs and what
he becomes when collecting a certain powerup, and after is the power-ups and
different status' explained.

                     ----------Cape Feather-----------

---------
Power-Ups
---------

Mushroom
This turns Small Mario into Super Mario.

Fire Flower
This turns Mario (Small or Super) into Fire Mario.

Cape Feather
This turns Mario (Small or Super) into Caped Mario.

-----------
Small Mario
-----------

This is the default Mario status. You start as Small Mario, and you will 
probably die as Small Mario (seeing as one touch of an enemy or something
harmful means you lose a life). In this state, it is advised you collected
a powerup to gain better abilities. You cannot use the spin jump to destroy the 
rotating blocks also.

-----------
Super Mario
-----------

This is the mostly preferred status. When you collect a Mushroom you turn into
Super Mario (if you are Small Mario, otherwise you might get the mushroom
stored in the Item Stock). Super Mario can jump and hit better, and can also
use the spin jump to destroy the rotating blocks. He is also better visually
than Small Mario, which looks like a crushed can.

----------
Fire Mario
----------

Same as Super Mario, apart from a more redish appearance and the ability to
shoot fireballs at will. To become Fire Mario, collect the Fire Flower.
Pressing Y fires a fireball, which can defeat certain enemies.

-----------
Caped Mario
-----------

My favourite, Caped Mario, is Super Mario but with a cape, thus having the
power to fly. To become Caped Mario, collect the Cape Feather. Flying is
quite tricky at first and takes some practice, so be sure to do so. To get into
the air, make sure you have some run way ahead of you, and run. When Mario's 
arms at out to the sides, press Jump to soar high into the air. To stay in the
air, just press the opposite to the direction you are going when you are
dropping downward. For example, when flying to right, press left when you are
falling to go up again. Doing this means you can stay in the air for some time.
To descend, hold Y to descend slowly. Or, to do it quicker and to smash
into the ground, press Y and Down. Smashing into the ground means that nearby
enemies will be defeated or hurt, but is somewhat risky if you are doing it
from far up as you could drop into a hole.

If you get injured (eg. touched by an enemy) you revert back to Small Mario,
and if you are injured again you loose a life. If you have an item in the item
stock, then that automatically falls when you are injured too.

                                3. WALKTHROUGH
                              ------------------
===============================================================================

This is the walkthrough and is the main feature of this FAQ.

• Most level's are split into paragraphs. They are split mostly when you reach
  the midway checkpoint, or when the paragraph is too big (cos nobody likes 
  reading from big paragraphs, right?)

• If a level has a secret exit, then that is explained after the level's
  normal walkthrough.

• All levels feature the ways to get all five (or more) Dragon Coins that are
  in it, or otherwise stated (say if they are hard to get and are not worth
  bothering with).

• If you want to save before tackling a hard level or if you are on few lives
  and you have done several levels without saving, then go back and replay a
  ghost house so you can save your game at the end of it.

• The levels order in the area sections are normal level's first (the ones you
  come across if you are only doing the main walkthrough) followed by secret
  levels in the area.

Yoshi's House
-------------

The cute, if a little bare house of Yoshi. Jump into the information box from
underneath to discover that Yoshi is not in. Apart from that there is nothing
of interest here (later with Yoshi you can eat the berries) so exit back to the
map by walking to one of the sides. Now on the map, goto the level to the left,
Yoshi's Island 1.

----------------
Yoshi's Island 1
----------------

When the koopa slides down the bank and stops on the ground, jump on him.
Go right, on the diagonal platform, and jump into the first Dragon Coin, then
duck as you land to avoid the giant bullet bill. Proceed right, ignore the
dinosaur, and hit the flying block to get a mushroom. Ignore the dinos, over
the pipe, jump onto and go across the diagonal platforms, into the second
Dragon Coin. Run right, so at the hedge to make a mushroom appear from out of 
it. Jump onto the pipe (make sure the piranha plant is not present mind) and 
onto the yellow blocks covering a pipe. If you are Super Mario, spin jump to 
clear these blocks and go down the pipe, otherwise move on. In the pipe, 
collect the coins, clear the blocks with the spin jump again and collect the 
third Dragon Coin, then enter the pipe. You will now be thrown out next to the 
checkpoint, so go through the tape.

Right, ignore the dotted box (you will deal with these in a second) and read
the information block if you wish. Ignore the dino, and jump up to the first
platform to dodge the three oncoming dinos, then go up the other two and grab
the forth Dragon Coin at the top. Travel down the slide, into the ditch and 
duck to avoid the giant bullet bill. You now notice a red shell on the floor, 
so pick it up (X or Y) and throw it up at the yellow block above you (UP and
let go of X or Y). A 1-up green mushroom comes out of the yellow block, to
get it quickly run right, over the gap, duck in the ditch and jump over the
next gap as it falls. Jump over the dino, and jump onto the middle block, then
into the ? block to receive a powerup (fire flower if you are Super Mario,
mushroom if you are small mario). Head right. Ignore (or fireball :P) the next
two dinos, and jump onto the platform to dodge yet another giant bullet bill
(if you wanna get cocky, jump on him as he goes to the left of you). Watch
the pipe for a piranha plant, and kill the dino after it, then collect the
last Dragon Coin to get yourself a 1-Up. Now is the end of the level, and a 
charging chuck. Get used to these guys, as they are at the end of quite a
few levels. Bounce off him to gain height for the exit.

--------------------
Yellow Switch Palace
--------------------

Welcome to your first Switch Palace!

There are blocks in the game that are nothing but coloured dotted lines.
There are four different colours of these; Yellow, Red, Blue and Green. At
four different switch palaces, you can activate these dotted blocks into !
blocks permanently. At a yellow switch palace, you change the yellow dotted
blocks into yellow ! blocks, at the red switch palace you change the red
dotted blocks into red ! blocks etc. The switch palaces, apart from Yellow,
are hidden and require searching for. They are of use during the game, as they
create blocks that make gaps shorter and give you powerups at times when you
will most probably need them.

So as you can see, they are of great use. Anyways, in the palace is a blue
P-Switch. Jump on it, to make the room filled with coins for a short period. So
quickly go crazy and collect as many as you can (you can get 2 1-Up's easily).
When you are done, travel through the pipe at the bottom right of the area.
Next screen, run right and jump on the giant yellow switch. You work here is
now done, and you get the opportunity to save. Save and continue. Travel
back and now goto the level that was to the right of Yoshi's House, Yoshi's
Island 2.

----------------
Yoshi's Island 2
----------------

Go right and pick up the red shell that is on the ground, then jump onto the
higher ledge. There is a line of koopa's ahead, so throw the shell at them
to clear the lot and to get a 1-Up for clearing eight enemies in a row (run
along with the shell to be sure it gets them all). Run off the ledge and
collect the mushroom out of the newly created ! block, and go on to another
two blocks. Hit the second one to unleash Yoshi for the first time. After his
little talk, jump on him. Go right, eat the red koopa and collect the first
Dragon Coin that is above. Onwards is another koopa, kill him and collect the
second Dragon Coin that's above. Go up the steps, watch out for the charging 
chuck at the top and jump off the ledge to collect the another Yoshi Coin. Bowl 
through the checkpoint.

Over the yellow pipes, and hit the three blocks. In one of these is another
Yoshi egg; if you have Yoshi though, a 1-Up green mushroom pops out instead.
The next ledges area, you will meet some moles. You will tell if they appear
and you can see the dirt in the ledges moving about, so simply stand above
so when they jump out they hit underneath you for a quick kill. To the right
of the ledges area are two blocks; hit the second one to make a vine appear 
from it. Dismount off Yoshi and climb this vine to reach a set of clouds
and Dragon Coin No. 4. Go back down and ride Yoshi again, then go right and 
grab the fifth Dragon Coin that is above. Pop the block to grab a mushroom, 
then onwards to a blue pipe, which you can travel down. In this cave area there
are flying blocks far up; to hit them, either grab the blue blocks in the
middle of the area and throw them up or if you still have Yoshi, jump then
dismount to get enough height to hit them that way. They contain mostly coins,
and one contains a 1-Up green mushroom. When you are done, exit through the 
pipe right. When you appear from the grey pipe, go right to the yellow blocks
that surround the P-Switch. Hit the block underneath to make it drop down, and
jump on it to make the coins turn into blocks. Jump onto these blocks and exit.

----------------
Yoshi's Island 3
----------------

Jump up the ledges, then right to the wooden platform. This moves in a circle
movement, so let it go round once to get the coins and jump off at the right
ledge. The next part the yellow blocks expand from 1 block to 5 blocks, then
back again, so watch out. As long as you activated the ! blocks in the yellow
switch palace, you shouldn't worry about falling as the ! with stop you.
Collect the first Dragon Coin, onto the ledge, to the wooden platform and jump
off at the next ledge. Hit the second block to get Yoshi, then make you way
across the moving platforms to the next green ledge. Eat the koopa, and drop
off the platform to land on a yellow pipe below, and enter it. In the cave
activate the P-Switch and across the newly formed blocks, getting the second
Dragon Coin at the end. Exit through the green pipe, and then head right to the
checkpoint.

Jump/eat the approaching koopa and collect the third Dragon Coin, and right to
the set of yellow blocks where you jump on, then to the ledge. Jump onto the
moving platform, then to the next ledge, then onto the moving wooden platform.
Jump off at the expanding yellow blocks (aim to land in the middle to be safe)
and go across the other ones to get the forth Dragon Coin. Onto the ledge, then
across more platforms to the ledge with a star block above. If you have 30
coins and above, you get an extra life from this block. Head across the two
wooden platforms, and collect the fifth and final Dragon Coin by the sign. Now
simply head right to the exit.

----------------
Yoshi's Island 4
----------------

Go right and drop the ledge to the floating bit of land and the levels first
Dragon Coin. Jump onto the block to the right, and run and jump to the second
Dragon Coin that's in the air. Go across the two floating platforms and down
the blue pipe. Go right, and you will encounter a Pokey. If you still have
Yoshi from another level, you can eat it one segment at a time. If you are on
your tod then he will be smaller and can be jumped over. Keep going right where
you will encounter a few more of these, and at the end a pipe to exit. When you
exit, go left and avoid the shell for now, and collect the third Dragon Coin
that is above a floating platform. Now grab the koopa shell and throw it up at
the block high up on the left to drop the P-Switch. Activate the switch, then
hit the block to the right to get a starman (makes you invisible for a bit) and
go onto the blocks that have formed. Collect the forth Dragon Coin as you go
and bowl into the koopa's to kill them in your state. Keep going right over the
floating platforms (watch out for the spikey things, but if you are still
invincible you should be alright) until you reach the fifth Dragon Coin. Go
right, across the last two platforms and into the green pipe to the exit area.

----------------
#1 Iggy's Castle
----------------

Read the information block if you want, and jump and press Up to climb onto
the fence. Go right, dodging the koopa's that are on your side as you go
and punch (X) the ones that are on the other side. Go right unto you reach
a P-Switch with blocks above them. The P-Switch does nothing so ignore it;
and the middle block has a mushroom. Carry on going right on the fence.
Watch out when going over the lava for a fireball, and later the squares are
doors when hit allows you to go on the other side of the fence, however doing
so has little point. At the end, hit the information block if you want and
touch the tape in the checkpoint. Enter the door.

The screen now moves automatically, and there are giant crushers that come from
the ceiling. For the all of them, stay on the far left to avoid. You will
come across a flying block (contains a mushroom) and an expanding / contracting
yellow block along the way. Enter the red door at the end to fight the boss
and owner of the castle, Iggy.

BOSS: IGGY
This battle takes place on a platform that tilts left and right, and you have
to hit Iggy into the lava either side of the area. He will attack by throwing
fireballs, of which are easy to avoid. Jumping on Iggy will make him move
down the side its tilting. So, when it is tilting one side, jump on him
once or twice to make him go to one end, leave him when it tilts to the other
side, and then hit him off when it reverts back to the first side again.
Well done! You have done the games first castle. After the sequence, you
will go back to the map. Head onwards to the next area, Donut Plains.

Now you are introduced to the secret levels. If it has a secret exit, it will
be revealed at the end of the level's walkthrough. The walkthroughs to these
secret levels are found at the end of this areas normal level walkthroughs.

--------------
Donut Plains 1
--------------

Head right, and jump on the super koopa that approaches. Collect the cape
feather powerup that he drops to become Caped Mario (allowing you to fly).
Head up the ledges while avoiding the super koopa's and grab the first Dragon 
Coin that is at the top. Drop off the ledge, and run right to make a mushroom 
come from the hedge. Go to the charging chuck just ahead, spin on the spot (X) 
next to him to kill him. Spinning your cape in this manner is useful for 
killing alot of enemies that you will come across. Go right, past the ledge,
jump up to the higher ground and spin at the flower. Jump onto the ledge to the
right, avoid the super koopa and jump off to collect the second Dragon Coin. 
Go right and travel up the blue upside down pipe. Here you can gain lives by
hitting the three blocks in the correct order, then you move onto the next set
and keep going till you reach the pipe at the top, where you exit. Note that
these are random, and so I cannot tell you which ones to pick. When you 
exit, enter the pipe to the left of you. Here is a place to try out flying with
the cape. Collect the cape feather and read what the information box has to
say, then run up the side of the pipe and fly away (notes on flying in the
2.05. Power-ups section). There are LOADS of coins in air, and on the ground
also, so mess about here for it a bit (the levels timer still counts down
though). When you are done, exit through the pipe to the far right of the
area.

Go right, over the gap and up the two step like ledges. The block here holds
a Yoshi egg. Right is a pit with two charging chucks throwing balls across
it; hitting the block fourth from the left makes a vine grow, which leads to
the clouds and the third Dragon Coin. However doing this is a bit of a risk,
as avoid the football things that the chucks throw is hard work, so its upto
you if you wanna go and do it. Anyways, use the blocks to go across
the pit and onward. Collect the third Yoshi Coin, and drop down the ledge and
hit the block under the charging chuck to dispose of him. The set of ledges to
the right all have a super koopa on each ledge coming your way, so watch out
for them (duck on the ground; or eat one with Yoshi to give you some room).
Go right and collect the forth Yoshi Coin by the pipe, and then use the
ledges to go up and over the pipe. Head right, ignore the dotted green blocks
for now, and head to the exit (mind the charging chuck though). Note that
the other Dragon Coin is on clouds in the middle of the level

SECRET EXIT - Unlocks 'Donut Secret 1'
There are two ways of doing this; the normal way is to go to the green switch
palace to make the dotted lined blocks into full blocks, and return to this
level and run up them at the end, where you will reach a key and hole. Pick
up the key and put it into the hole. The other way is to fly to this point.
Find a nice runway in the level, and with the cape equipped fly to the end
and over the pipe that blocks the way and drop in, and put the key in the hole.
Although the flying way means that you can unlock the level on your first run
here, its tricky to pull off.

--------------
Donut Plains 2
--------------

This levels camera moves automatically and so Mario has to navigate around it.
At the start, go to the blocks and get as many coins as you can (why not?)
and the mushroom for the ! block (if you have activated it). Avoid the baddies,
and when you reach the place with the yellow rock, stand there and don't wait
otherwise you will get crushed. Collect the first Dragon Coin. When it goes
down, hit the ? block and go to the right of the yellow rock here. For a while
now you keep getting yellow rock columns pushing up; just keep going and 
avoid the bats. Be sure to collect the second Dragon Coin on the way and the
third one when the path gets sorter vertically. When the yellow rock dips from
the ceiling here don't panic. Collect the fourth Dragon Coin before the last
yellow rock, and get on it when it comes down. Then when it goes up again,
jump right to collect the fifth and final Dragon Coin. Go over the pipe,
and into the green pipe to reach the outside and the exit.

SECRET EXIT - Unlocks 'Green Switch Palace'
Play the level until you get to the part where there are just columns of the
yellow rock rising vertically. You may notice the pipes coming from the
ceiling. When you reach the second green one, you can travel into it, so do so.
In this new area where the screen doesn't move (woohoo) hit the block, and go
right. Avoid or kill the charging chuck (watch for his footballs) and move
onwards to the yellow blocks. Go right, and you use the spin jump to smash the
blocks that enclose the blue koopa shell. Pick it up, and throw it up at the
further most block to the right of the blocks to the left. This will make a
vine appear from it. Climb the blocks, up the vine, and pickup the key and run
into the keyhole.

-----------------
Donut Ghost House
-----------------

Go right, but keep on the move and don't jump too high otherwise the ghosts
from above will swoop down and hit you. At the end is a door, enter it.
The ghost's here, when you have your back turned to them, will chase you, but
if you face them they will stay still, so keep this in mind. Go up the stairs,
and into the door. You will appear below, go left and hit the yellow block
to make a P-Switch appear. Jump from under the stairs and go and pick up the
switch, and go through the door again. Hit the block again, this time to
make a vine appear. Climb it, and enter the door. You will reach the exit.

SECRET EXIT - Unlocks 'Top Secret Area'
Before going into this level, be sure that Mario is Caped, and also have
a cape feather in the item stock in case. Start the level, and go right and
stop at the gap. Now run left and fly up to the top left corner of the
level, where there is a gap in the ceiling. Run right, and drop down to
four blocks and a door. The blocks all have 1-Up Green Mushrooms and then enter
the door and exit here.

--------------
Donut Plains 3
--------------

Go right, onto the one of the move platforms and jump off to the ledge. Go
onto the wooden platform and another grey one (with a Dragon Coin above) and 
onto the next ledge. If you have Yoshi, you can eat this blue koopa and fly
about for a short length of time. Go right, dodging the onslaught of koopa's,
and destroy the first few yellow blocks with a spin jump and hit the fourth one
on the right from underneath to make a vine appear. Take the right ledge up and
climb the vine to reach an area with coins and the second Dragon Coin. Now
drop the edge, back to the main level (if you left Yoshi behind and still
want to ride him, then go back down the vine and across some moving platforms
to this point). Jump onto the platform that's right, and hit the block to
change the route. Change it again at the next block, and jump to get the third
Dragon Coin. The platform will fall by the checkpoint, so run through the tape.

Jump onto the platform right, but at a time so the black enemy doesn't run
into you, then jump off to the moving platforms. At the height of this, jump
off to the higher platform on the right which follows another route, until
you reach the forth Dragon Coin and a pipe, of which you can access. This
is another bonus game to get lives, and when you are done exit at the top
to appear further in the level. Go back a little to a moving platform and
travel on it to get the fifth Dragon Coin that is at the bottom, then carry
on going right again. Jump on another moving platform, be wary of the black
enemy, and off onto the platform, which follows a route to the exit.

--------------
Donut Plains 4
--------------

Head right, and try and prevent the koopa from getting into the yellow shell.
If he gets in, he goes invincible, so then quickly climb onto the pipe to
avoid him. Run and jump to the higher ledge to get the first Dragon Coin.
Drop off heading right, over the yellow pipe, and onto the cool extending
green pipe. Jump onto the next pipe, at a time to avoid the piranha plant that
comes from it. Enter the pipe. This area consists of more extending pipes,
so just make your way across them to the far end while avoiding the flying
koopas. Enter the pipe at the end to return to the main level. Go right
and hit the bottom of the floating platform to knock the hammer throwing
baddy off, and either use the platform or running up the side to get up the
next ledge. To get a 1-Up here, jump on the first koopa and throw the shell
right to make it bounce around and go into the enemies. Down the slopes and
hit the blocks to get coins and a powerup, and hit the right set to make
them rotate, where you can get through and carry on. Enter the next pipe to
reach an underground area. Avoid the koopas and at the gap, jump onto them
so you make it across the gap and to collect the third Dragon Coin. Exit, to
be thrown out into the checkpoint.

Right, over the gap and hit the block to get Yoshi. The next hole has the
level's forth Dragon coin, and go right to you reach a new block. Hit it at
the right time to get the power-up you want. Hit the enemy here on the platform
from underneath again, and use the platform to continue. Head right over
some jagged landscape while avoiding or killing the gombas that are parachuting
in or are on the ground. At the next gap, hit the platform bound enemy from
beneath and use the platform to get across the gap and into the exit.

------------------
#2 Morton's Castle
------------------

As per usual, go right. Avoid the jumping blocks, and travel up the stairs
while avoiding the ball and chains that are swinging. Enter the door at the
top. Go left (for a change), to meet a falling block. It will only fall when
you approach it, and move by it when it goes back up. Carry on going to the
top and another door. Go up the platforms when they appear into view, and 
at the top on the left one. Jump right, and when the rock goes left hit the
blocks to get some coins and a powerup. Stand on the blocks until a rock
in the right wall appears. Jump onto this and then head left and up the gap in
the stone blocks quickly. Jump to the right, and wait until you can head up to
the koopa skeleton and springboard. Jump on the skeleton to put it out
of action briefly, and position the springboard so its under the left gap.
At the right time jump on the board while holding jump down to go up and
land on the right. Wait until stair like platforms appear from the left, travel
up them and hit the rotating blocks to get up and out. Jump on the skeleton,
and when its clear use the grey blocks to make your way up quickly before
you get crushed. Head left and up, and jump on the middle block. Wait, then
go onto the above block, up and right quickly to reach an area with a lot
of grey blocks with yellow spikes on them. Head across the stone columns left
to the slightly taller ones, and onto a left platform when it appears, then
up to the boss door.

BOSS: MORTON
To hurt Morton, simply jump on his head. He will walk left, up the wall and
drop from the ceiling where ever you are standing. When he lands you are
immobilised for a second. So the tactic is when he is about to come over you
and fall, jump out of the way and then jump on him. He will speed up when
he gets hit, and after three bops to the noggin he's done for. Easy, no?
You can also use fireballs to hurt Morton if you are Fire Mario also.
Anyways, now you have now unlocked the path to the Vanilla Dome. But first,
the walkthroughs to the secret levels within the Donut Plains.

-------------------
Green Switch Palace
-------------------

When you begin, pick up the koopa shell and hit the P-Switch nearby. Now drop
down when the koopa is on the left, and throw it at him. The shell will go left
and bounce off the wall, then right into the other koopas to get a 1-Up. 
However make sure that you run along with the shell at the top so that it
doesn't disappear off the screen and break the chain. When you are done, enter
the pipe at the top right of the area. Now simply run right and jump onto the
giant green switch. Now throughout dinosaur land all the dotted green blocks
have become full ! green blocks. Yay for the green blocks! ;)

---------------
Top Secret Area
---------------

This area is a place to restock on power-ups or Yoshi. It simply consists of
five ? blocks; the left two are Mushrooms or Fire Flowers, the centre block
is Yoshi, and the right two blocks are mushrooms or Cape Feathers. To exit,
just go out of either side of the area. You can enter this area as many times
as you need, and I would recommend checking this place out before tackling
harder levels or for things that require these powerups. Also, to get as many
lives are you want, get Yoshi, then exit and re-enter. Hit the Yoshi block
again and you get a 1-Up Green Mushroom (seeming as you have Yoshi on you) and
this can be repeated as many times as you like. A great area that I'm sure you
will be using a lot.

--------------
Donut Secret 1
--------------

An underwater level... cool, no? The controls here are pretty much the same
as on land, pressing jump will make you swim. Touching the fish here will
hurt you, so don't get too close. To kill a fish, either throw a fireball,
throw a block or spin your cape near them. Anyways, the walkthrough.
Go right, and avoid the sleeping fish at the bottom, otherwise you will wake it
up. Swim right, and go around the rock until you reach some blocks. Go under
them and hit them to kill the fish above, and also collect the fire flower
that is from one of these blocks. Don't forget the first Dragon Coin here too.
Go round the bottom of the blocks and right, then up the pipe. You will come
out to some dry land. Head right and hit the ? block to make a P-Balloon be
released, and grab it to inflate and start rising. Go left, and you will
come across a platform when you are about to deflate. Hit the block here for
another P-Balloon, so carry on going up. At the very top, grab the Dragon Coin
while still rising and land onto one of the blocks. Jump to next block, and
then jump off to the right to collect another Dragon Coin. You will now fall
down to the bottom again, so exit via the pipe on the right. 

When you appear underwater again, go down into the gap and get the Dragon Coin
(the level's forth) and proceed right. The block below has a power-up, and if
timed correctly you can kill the sleeping fish when you hit it. Go right, under
the two fish. To get the Dragon Coin here, either kill the fish or go round
the other side to avoid it, then move the block and grab it. Now simply keep
going right. At the P-Switch, you can unlock the secret exit (see the secret
exit at the end for more details). From now on is just dodging fish and making
your way through the rock formations to the exit (be sure to collect the
sixth Dragon Coin on the way there). This will unlock a path the Donut Ghost
House.

SECRET EXIT - Unlocks 'Donut Secret House'
When you reach the P-Switch in this level, pick it up and carry on in the level
until you get to a row of brown blocks and a ? block. Activate the switch here,
then hit the ? block to release a key. Pick up the key and slam it into the
nearby keyhole. Score!

------------------
Donut Secret House
------------------

Go right, up the stairs, and drop down to the next level when there is a gap
in the circle of ghosts. Drop down again and go right when the gap is present.
Duck in the ghost that is coming towards you, and head right to the P-Switch
and the Big Boo. These are the same as the normal Boo's, apart from that they
are, in fact, bigger. Activate the P-Switch and grab the springboard that
just dropped down, place it by the Big Boo and propel yourself over him. Head
right and enter the door when you reach it.

Heading left now, hit the block to get a powerup, and onward. Jump or go under
the boo, and go through the circle of ghosts when the gap is there. Hitting
the block here gives you coins, then carry on left when you are done. Collect
the coins in a door frame shape here, and go over the yellow blocks to the 
left. Hit the information box to learn about the Star World. Go past the two
Boo's to the end. Don't enter the door, as it will take you back to the
previous area. Grab the P-Switch from above, and go back right to the yellow
blocks. Activate it, and enter the blue door that appears on the ledge next
to the yellow blocks. Here is the normal exit, and can save the game and move
onto Donut Secret 2. (and take a sneak peak at the final area of the game..)
SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Star Road 1'
Play the level until you get to the P-Switch and the yellow blocks. Grab
the P-Switch and head back right, then activate it by the yellow blocks.
Now stand where the normal door is (on the ? blocks that have just formed)
and hit the middle block above to make a vine appear. Scale up it and go right
through the secret door (get there before the P-Switch has warn out or it
will not be there). You will be taken to a mini-boss; Big Boo. To harm him,
grab a block from below you and throw it at him (its easier to be underneath
him and throw it upwards). Once you have hit him, he will turn transparent.
Keep looking towards the Boo's so they don't attack you, and get yourself
underneath Big Boo so when he reappears you can attack again. After a total
of three hits, you win, and you unlock the warp to the Star Road.

--------------
Donut Secret 2
--------------

This cave level is icy, thus it will be slippy so have this in mind when
playing. It might be best if you have a cape and also a feather in reserve, as
many jumps in this level are tricky and its easier if you float down after
jumping for safety (also you can fly most of the level to the green pipe). 
When you start, go to the right of the block and jump on the Koopa.
Throw his shell against the block to make a line of coins appear, of which
is controllable with the D-Pad. Head up the ledges and grab the Dragon Coin at
the top, and move onward. Jump on the springboard so you hit the block above
to make the vine appear. Move the springboard to the left or right so you
can jump onto the block and up the vine. The block here contains a starman;
so grab it as it comes out to the right, collecting the Dragon Coin as you go
and then drop to the right, as straight down is a hole. Right, up the ledges
collecting the third Dragon Coin as you go, onto the next ledge and drop down
to get the forth Dragon Coin. Over the gap, over several more ledges up to
the diagonal slide. Travel down, and onto the first pipe (even the pipes
are slippy!). Go across the next two, minding that piranha plants emerge from
them and that you will slide quite bad when you land. It helps to be caped here
(if possible). When you reach the ledge after the pipes, go up the green pipe
to the outside. Hit the ? block for a P-Balloon and simply use it to
float over to the pipe at the end. If you miss it, just make your way across
the platforms and pipes. Enter the pipe to return to the cave. 

Go left and get the Yoshi Coin, and head right as normal. Hit the block for a
coin, and jump on the Koopa and hit his shell to the right to kill a group of
enemies that were tailing behind him. Go up the slope, and jump onto the top of
the line of Koopas to get an easy 1-Up, and hold right (or even better float
with the cape) so you land below the pipe, then go right to the exit. If you
think that killing the Koopa's and then landing on the ledge might be difficult
you can simply go above the pipe. When you complete the level, you unlock a
path back to the Donut Plains, to Donut Plains 3.

NOTE: Vanilla Secret 2 and 3, and Vanilla Fortress are on the Main Overworld,
to the left of 'The Twin Bridges' area.

--------------
Vanilla Dome 1
--------------

Go down the steps and jump over the red enemy that is climbing up. Go right,
avoiding the bats, and hit the flying block up the ledge to get a power-up.
Further on is a large amount of blocks. As many of the values and items within
them are hidden, here is an ASCII diagram of what they contain -

    S 
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXFXXXXXXX                           X = Empty Block
        X     X        X                           C = Coin
        X     X        X    X    X                 S = Shell

|                                    |

Note that there are several enemies in places, but putting them down on the
diagram would be useless as they move about and they are easily spotted. Also,
if you run across the bottom, more on the right half, a mushroom will appear.
Once you are done here, move onward. The block on the ground contains either
a mushroom or fire flower, is obtained by either hitting it side on with a cape
or by hitting it will the shell of a nearby enemy. Ignore the red dotted blocks
above you for now. Keep going right, over a few gaps and into a pipe to go to
a new area. Be sure the hit the block ahead and grab the starman that comes 
from it, and run across the yellow platform right as fast as you can before
it sinks. You will go through the enemies unharmed due to you being invincible,
and at the end jump to get the levels second Dragon Coin, then travel through
the pipe.

Run right and jump onto the platform ahead, where the checkpoint is located.
Drop down, and go right into a maze like area. Hit the blocks and go up and
right. If you are small Mario then head through the passage ahead and get the
Dragon Coin, otherwise you have to go via the bottom. Hit the ? block after
for a mushroom or fire flower, and use the blocks as a means of getting over
the gap. At the pipes, get onto the second one along and jump on the flying
koopa to get to the third pipe, and also the Dragon Coin that is above. Jump
to the steep slope, and get up it by running and jumping while climbing it. 
Onward, fall to the bottom passage, move the shell and block out of the way
and collect the Dragon Coin at the end, then go back and use the rotating
blocks to get up and out. Pick up the blue shell, jump right over the gap
and throw it at the Chuck ahead. Exit the level. 

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Vanilla Secret 1'
Play the level until you reach the red dotted blocks. If you have activated
the Red Switch Palace then climb up the blocks here and hit the block, then
climb the vine that appears out of it to get to the key and keyhole. If you
haven't, and the blocks are dotted, then you can use Yoshi to help you get up
by jumping then dismounting to gain a lot of height (enough to hit the block
and to get above it when done again).

--------------
Vanilla Dome 2
--------------

After dropping into the drink, head right to dry land and jump on the fish
that's washed up. Head right into the water, and hit the ? blocks just above
the surface (these contain coins and a mushroom/fire flower power-up). Swim
down and right, ignore the fish, and hit the block at the other end then climb
up the vine that comes from it. Jump off to the right, and keep going until
you drop down where an arrow is (with the levels first Dragon Coin). Back into
more water, go right between the fish, and hit the blocks (the left and middle
blocks hold coins, whereas the right on has a mushroom/feather). Carry on right
into the small passage. The block here has a mushroom/fire flower powerup;
collect it if you want. Now you have two choices based on what status Mario
is in...

If you are any Mario...
Jump onto the block and jump up the right ledge, then the left edge while
getting the Dragon Coin. Now run and jump right so you get up the steep slope.
A charging chuck will run through the yellow blocks, jump over him when he
approaches you and carry on right. Enter the midway checkpoint and jump over
the charging chuck that comes through the yellow blocks. Go right, but watch
out as he will give chase. Hit the block here and collect the powerup you
want by touching it at the right moment. Slide down this slope (press down) 
to get the third Dragon Coin and hit the P-Switch to get through the wall of
blocks. Avoid the charging chuck, and hit the block here, of which contains
either a mushroom or fire flower. Go right to the green pipe, where the
path the main walkthrough continues below the other choice.

If you are Small Mario or Caped Mario only...
Carry on swimming right until you get to land again and yellow blocks. As soon
as you get near the yellow blocks, a charging chuck will bomb towards you, so
quickly jump left to avoid him, where he will go into the water. Swim right
to the blocks again now it is safe; if you are Small Mario jump and go above
the blocks, if you are Caped Mario use your cape to rotate the blocks to
let you through. Head right over some jagged landscape, and grab one of the
shells of these enemies here and throw it up when you are under the Charging
Chuck to get rid of him, then go to the above ledge. This block contains
either a mushroom or fire flower. Go right to the green pipe, where the
path the main walkthrough continues below.

At the green pipe, jump to the ledge that's right and collect the Dragon Coin,
then go back and access the pipe, to an icy cave. Remember that here you slide
about a lot, so watch your speed otherwise you will not stop in time. Go right
and over the two pools of water, then stop at the block (otherwise you will
slide into some enemies) and hit the ? block several times to get some coins.
Jump onto the midair rock when the red enemy is at the bottom, then proceed up
the pipe after. As soon as you appear back in the cave, go left or right to
avoid the bats that swoop down. Proceed right; hit the block several times
for several coins, and run under the ledge with the charging chuck on (and
marvel at the way he duplicates himself; the Mario World's Agent Smith
perhaps?) and either jump or go under the next rock and into the exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Red Switch Palace'
Go to where you where the choice is in the walkthrough, and take the 'any
Mario' route (where you jump on the block from the water, up the right ledge
then left to the P-Switch). Go onto the left ledge, and keep going until
you get to a P-Switch that is resting on a mass of brown used blocks. Pick up
the P-Switch and go through the left line of coins and activate it (make sure
you are not standing on the mass of brown blocks). Go left, across the first
gap and down second one (so you go down the first gap on the left). Collect
the Dragon Coin, and go out of the water and right, and pick up the Key. Take
either the left or right route in the water down below to the keyhole.

-------------------
Vanilla Ghost House
-------------------

Jump over or duck under the bottom of the two ghosts that are coming your way, 
then go right. At the circle of ghosts, go underneath the ledge to get a
Dragon Coin and go above the ledge and hit the block to get a power-up. Go
right and make your way across the short ledges, and keep an eye on the Boo's
so that they don't creep up behind you. One of the higher ledges has the
second Dragon Coin; and keep going until you reach some lines of yellow blocks
and a Big Boo. None of the blocks here contain anything; so go either above
or below the Big Boo and move on. At the next block, collect the powerup inside
and lore the Big Boo on the right towards you by turning away, then as it
is close to the block, face him and use the block to jump over him. Go up
these ledges and wait at the top until there is a break in the circle of ghosts
ahead, then slide down the stairs. Face right to keep the Boo there at bay;
hit the block several times for coins, and just the block above to help you 
get the Dragon Coin. When you are done, go right and enter the door.

Go right and avoid the green bubble. As you can probably imagine, touching
these bubbles hurts, so avoid contact with them. Its best to avoid them by
jumping over them (Small Mario might have trouble doing this) or ducking or
going underneath them. Anyway, keep on moving right avoiding them until
you reach three yellow blocks; hit the middle one and grab the P-Switch that
comes from it. Carry on going right, past the door and collect the forth
Dragon Coin and the coins that are in a door shape. Now activate the P-Switch
then enter the blue door on the right. Exit.

--------------
Vanilla Dome 3
--------------

Go down and board the raft made of skulls, which will sail right. When you
see eyes appear in the lava, get ready to jump as a dinosaur will appear
underneath you in a second or two. Hit the blocks (containing coins) and
another lava bound dino, jump off the raft when it falls down the gap.
Jump on the yellow pipe and hit the block above to get a powerup, then go up
the other pipes, minding the piranha plants that jump from them. Slide down the
steep bank, collect the Dragon Coin, board the raft and hit the flying block
for a coin. Avoid the three dinos that jump at you from the lava and jump off
then the raft falls down that gap at the end of the lava. Go right to the pipes
and jump on the side of the left pipe to make a block appear, which you use to
get up. The block in the middle contains a powerup, and continue right to
another raft. Jump off at the blocks and collect the Dragon Coin in front of 
you, then go past the pipes ahead while watching out for the plants that
come from them. Jump on the raft then onto the rock above, follow it along
(ignore the block) and drop onto it at the other side, and then jump onto the
yellow pipe. Up and right and run up the side of the pipe, and time your
jump down so you land on the shell (stopping it) then tag the tape in the
checkpoint.

Use the shell and hit it upward and the block above to get Yoshi. Get out
of between the pipes and board yet another raft to the right. Keep jumping
to avoid the dinos in the lava as per usual. At the drop, jump onto the rock
ahead, and jump to collect the Dragon Coin when the raft is at a position so
you can land on it. Jump off the raft when it disappears. Go right, over the
pipes while avoiding the red enemies, then over more gaps (collect the 
Dragon Coin on the way) and collect the powerup from the lone block ahead. 
Board another raft, jumping on the rock and keep up with the raft as it goes
under you. Watch out for the plants coming from the pipes here, and jump back
onto the raft on the other side. When the raft reaches the end of the lava,
jump into the exit to end the level.

--------------
Vanilla Dome 4
--------------

This level has Bullet Bills that come from the sides throughout, so keep on
your toes. Jump down to the next ledge, then left and down again, and go right
and grab the Dragon Coin as you jump over the gap. Jump onto the end of the
springy green thing that's above and hold jump to get propelled high; so go
over the tall white column. Head right onto the ledge, and get this koopas
shell and throw it at the flying koopa that you will meet next. Go down the
bottom here if you want the mushroom; then go back up to the top and move
onward. Drop down below, up the two columns leading up. Keep going right over
the ledges, get the level's second Dragon Coin over the springy beams and use
the one by the next column to continue. Jump on the used block and hit the
block above to get a powerup, and move onward right, past the Koopa, over the
next column, under the two flying koopas and use the springy beams at the
column when they are over to the left. Go right, and bounce off the flying
Koopa to go through the checkpoints tape that is located high up.

When you fall, dispose of the Koopa, and go right past the first pipe (mind
the piranha plant that jumps from it) and down the second pipe to a cave area.
Board the raft, and either jump or duck the blocks that meet your path, and
grab the third Dragon Coin when you jump off at the end. Enter the pipe to
return to the level above. Go right, down the bottom of the two columns to
get the Dragon Coin, and carry on to the exit, collecting the final Dragon Coin
as you go.

-----------------
#3 Lemmy's Castle
-----------------

Run to the right straight away to avoid the magicians magic. When he fires from
underneath the blocks and hits one of them, it creates a gap and a yellow
Koopa. Use the gap to reach the below. If you are a big Mario and you use the
spinning jump to destroy blocks, then you will go through the blocks below
afterwards and will die, so I would advise for the magician here to create the
gap for you. Grab the Koopa's shell and when he appears, throw it at him, or
simply jump on this head to kill him for a short while. Go right and hit the
block to get a power up. At the next part, use either the yellow blocks or
panels on the water to get across. When you reach the P-Switch that is
resting on a block above, get on the blocks underneath it and hit the block
below the P-Switch, activate, and using the higher blocks right, enter the
door that is on the used blocks quickly. This is surprisingly difficult; as
the Magician seems to destroy several blocks here when he arrives again, and
its difficult to make the jumps as it is (as Small Mario it's near impossible).
Otherwise, before activating the P-Switch, take some of the side coins away
to get to the door easier. If you do make it, then you will go to the midway
checkpoint and an extra life as an extra reward; and continue the walkthrough
at the next paragraph. Not making it through the door, carry on, over several
pools of lava and up to the door.

Go right and drop down when the rock has risen out of the lava, then go right
as it sinks. Jump on the skeleton to stop it for a short amount of time, 
and go right when it has risen enough and onto the next ledge. Essentially,
just keep moving onward, using your judgement on when to carry on when they
blocks have rose or sank far enough, and jump on the skeletons on the way.
At the end is a green ! block (if it was activated at the green switch palace
that is) containing a feather, and the red boss door. Enter here to face Lemmy.

BOSS: LEMMY
Here, you are in an area with pipes. Every few seconds, three things pop out
of the pipes at the same time; the boss, and two fakes. Hitting the boss means
you hurt him, and hitting a fake means they pop back in and do it again at
different points. Hitting the boss three times means he will fall through the
bottom into the lava below, and you win. The only thing that you should look
out for is a fireball that bounces around the area; just keep an eye on it
as you look out for the boss. This shouldn't be too difficult.

-----------------
Red Switch Palace
-----------------

Hit the P-Switch in front of you and quickly jump onto the blocks that just
formed ahead of you, keep jumping across them going right. The invisible Koopa
will now follow you underneath and go through several other Koopa's, and give 
you an extra life (eight baddies in a row). Stay on the last set of blocks
until the time runs out, where you will drop down but the Koopa will be
trapped, meaning your safe. Head through the pipe now, and is usual, run right
and jump on the giant red switch. Now all the dotted red blocks in Dinosaur
Land will become red ! blocks. Yay! (...)

----------------
Vanilla Secret 1
----------------

In this level, you have to head upward instead of the usual heading right all
the time. It's OK, you can calm down now. Anyways, take the ledges to the 
right upwards, then go left onto a rock in the air, and jump left again to
a set of ledges with two ? blocks at the top (the left containing a coin, and
the right containing a cape feather). Now jump on the flying Koopa on the right
and bounce off to get to the springy beams, and bounce yourself to the top.
Jump up the ledges the above you and hit the block several times to get coins.
Drop down the right to collect the Dragon Coin, then jump onto the pipe and
get rid of the Koopa. Hit the middle block and climb the vine that appears from
it. Avoid the flying Koopa on the way up, and jump off to get the Dragon Coin
that's to the right, then climb back up onto the left ledge. Get rid of the
flying Koopa, hit the block and go up the vine, and jump off to the left. Carry
on left, jump over the gap and jump down left to collect the level's third
Dragon Coin. Get back up via the springy beams, then go right over the gap
and up the ledges in the centre to top. Ignore the springboard for now and
jump to the blocks on the right, where you can get two coins and a cape
feather. Go back to the springboard, and jump up when gap appears in the
Koopas. If you having trouble with this, then try moving the springboard to
one of the sides and when the Koopas have gone to either side they leave a gap
there for a few seconds, making it easy to jump. When you get up, grab the
springboard to the right and carry up the ledges that are left; go right
at the pipe and on the midair rock, use the springboard to get the Dragon Coin
in the air, and take it to further right (on a lower ledge) for another one
above and the fifth and final Dragon Coin. Go back and on the pipe, using the
springy beams upward and right into the pipe. Simply run right quickly (to
avoid the Charging Chuck) and into the exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Star Road 2'
Follow the walkthrough as above until you get to the springboard. There are
now two ways to unlock the secret exit. The first and proper way is to unlock
the blue ! blocks (at the Forest of Illusion), which changes the empty blocks
somewhere to the left of the springboard to blue ! blocks. You take the 
springboard on top of these and use it up to the pipe above. The other way,
which can be done before getting to the blue switch palace, is to be caped, and
run across under the set of ledges where the springboard is and fly up to the
top right corner. When you enter the pipe, head up and right, dodge the 
Chuck and his football fire and head into the goal.

Vanilla Secret 2
----------------

As per usual, go right. Just walk under the two jumping Koopa's that are 
coming your way, then over the gap and get Yoshi from the block. Eat the
Koopas as you go, and save a shell to spit at the green ! block on the ground
that is a little further on (earning you a cape feather). Carry onward, getting
a Dragon Coin. Keep going over the jagged landscape, eating and jumping on the
jumping Koopas as you go. Eventually you get to a gap and two pink pipes.
Get the Dragon Coin that is in the middle of these, then go right to the
checkpoint.

Use the slanted ledge upward, and you will be welcomed with an onslaught of
parachuting Bob-ombs that will stay with you the rest of the level. Down the
hill, and jump / eat the enemy that's hiding in the pipe. Hit the third 
musical note block from the left to get a cape feather. Carry on right over
the green pipe, eat or jump over the spiked baddies that are coming your way
and jump onto the used block over the gap and hit the block above several times
to get a limited supply of coins (and also to get a Dragon Coin). Next, jump
onto the yellow blocks, then run and jump over the pit of spiked enemies. Run
and jump over the gap, up the green pipe, hit the baddie in the pipe after
and travel down it to a cave area. Simply activate the P-Switch and run left
across the bridge of used blocks, collect the coins as you go by jumping, and
get the forth Dragon Coin at the end, and head up the pipe. You will be thrown
out that slanted pipe that you travelled up not long ago, landing on a higher
ledge. Run and jump into the exit that's right.

1-UP TRICK
Here is a great trick for getting loads of 1-Ups. Play the level to the half
way checkpoint, then continue onward until you reach the pit full of Spiny's.
Hit the second rotating block (from the left) for a silver P-Switch. Grab it
and head back to before the halfway marker, and inbetween the two purple
pipes. Use the P-Switch, then collect the coins from the pipes then run back
left and collect the horde of silver coins from the transformed koopa's,
earning you a stack of lives. You can then exit the level and redo this as many
times as you like! Thanks to Alex Penismen and Rolf Karllson for contibuting
this!

----------------
Vanilla Secret 3
----------------

Jump onto one of the dolphins right, and make your way across the other three
and jump off onto the higher ledge. Hit the block to get a power-up (mushroom
or a cape feather) then jump off and grab the Dragon Coin. Right, and jump
across the oncoming of dolphins to the next platform, and get the second 
Dragon Coin. Note that from now on a pukka fish will be in the water following
Mario, so watch out and don't enter the water if you can help it. Now jump onto
a dolphin that's right, onto the one that jumping  vertically. A dolphin will
take you off this one, and hit the block to get a powerup, then go right to the
next ledge. Go right across more dolphins, and be sure to go through the
checkpoint on the way.

Keep going to the next ledge that is high up (use the vertical jumping dolphin
that is next to it). Jump to the next ledge via the two dolphins; be sure to
grab the Dragon Coin on the way. Wait here until some dolphins come from the
left, and jump on one when they do. Now just stay on while you are going right,
and through the coins shaped into arrows (jump out of the water when the
dolphin dips in the drink). At the end, get the Dragon Coin and into the pipe.
You will exit at the exit in sight, and the fifth and final Dragon Coin above
you.

----------------
Vanilla Fortress
----------------

You enter via a pipe to an underwater section. Looks like someone left the taps
on, eh? Swim right, and go past the ball and chain, and the next on at the top.
Now the route splits, according to the Mario that you are...

Small Mario only...
You can walk along the bottom under the set of spikes, and into the pipe.
Here, head right and over then under the two fish. When you come to the open
area, make the block drop, then as it rises swim onward. Hit the block here
to get a powerup. Now you can either swim upward; where you will face ball
and chains with fish, or you can go right, where you face those falling blocks
and the odd ball and chain, and some enemies. The top route is easier I think,
but none of the routes are long or that challenging and they come together
again anyways. When they do, go right and in the middle of the two ball and
chains, then carry on down the passage to a yellow ! block and the red boss
door.

Any Mario...
Go right on the higher passage and past the ball and chain. At the spikes, stay
below the ceiling to avoid the fish, then grab the power up from the block
afterwards. Carry on, where you will come to a ceiling laden with spikes. The
brown ones will fall off, and shake briefly before doing so. I would provoke
the spike by swimming under it for a brief moment then moving out its path
while it falls. As you go right also stay from the floor due to the enemies
there, so stay somewhere in the middle. After this, enter the pipe. Go right,
over the baddies and past the falling rock (make sure it falls first, then
go over it as it rises). Head right and in the middle of the two ball and
chains, then carry on down the passage to a yellow ! block and the red boss
door.

BOSS: REZNOR
You are faced against four dinosaurs on rotating platforms, of which spit
fireballs your way. To kill them, hit the platform from underneath. When you
have hit all four off the platforms, the boss is over. But (a big but) is the
ground is slowly disappearing, so you must be hasty in doing this. Hit one
off as you start, and when the ground is no long under where you can hit the
dino's from below, you may have to jump onto one of the rotating platforms.
The fireballs are easy enough to dodge, and if you do this fast enough it isn't
that tough. A good idea is to knock one off, jump on his platform and take out
the others as it rotates round.

Save your game now, and a bridge formed to the right, and you can play 'Butter
Bridge 1'. This is the end of the Vanilla Dome secret levels, and the
walkthrough for this level is in the next section.

------------------
Cheese Bridge Area
------------------

Run to the right, get the powerup from the block and jump onto the platform.
Jump over the chainsaw, onto the next platform above, jump over another
chainsaw and onto the platform above that one. Ride on it for a while, collect
the coins when you come to them, and watch out for a chainsaw when it comes.
Hit the block for a powerup, and shortly after grab the Dragon Coin. Keep
riding and jumping over the chainsaws, and eventually you reach a straight
line, and when the line ends, jump onto the checkpoint to the right.

Hit the block to release a set of wings. These are only used if you have Yoshi;
if you do collect them and you will be transported to a bonus area (see after
this paragraph for more information about this), otherwise ignore them. Jump on
to the rope (jump to it and press Up), and jump off at the platform. Jump right
to the next platform, hit the block to get a powerup, then get the Yoshi Coin
to the right and then head down the pipe. In this area, bullet bills will come
from each corner of the screen towards Mario every so often; when this happens,
jump straight upward and then down again (you can still jump on them to dispose
of them mind). Anyways, just make you way across the platforms and head up the
pipe at the other end. Back above, go right and climb onto the big rope. Now
you have to climb the rope to avoid the chainsaws. First of all, head up to the
top, then the middle, then to the top again and get the Dragon Coin. The rope
will then come to an end and just simply jump into the exit.

YOSHI BONUS AREA
To get here, collect the wings from the block after the midway checkpoint while
riding on Yoshi. You will fly upward into a bonus area. Pressing the jump
button makes Yoshi fly. When you start, head up to the top right and collect
the Dragon Coin (mind the black enemy mind) and wait until the screen goes
right, and collect another Dragon Coin. Head through the group of blocks
and enemies as the screen moves up and right, and through another group as it
goes down and left. When it goes up again, there are two Dragon Coins that are
surrounded by blocks; eat the enemy that's here, then enter from the left and
grab the coins, and exit out the top. Follow the screen as it does down, and
when you see the arrow made of blocks pointing down, drop down there to finish.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Soda Lake'
This is one of the hardest and annoying secret exits in the game. If you have
played the level as normal, you may have noticed that there wasn't any sign of
a secret exit. That's because it's BEHIND the normal exit! You cannot go
over it by flying; as its on a ledge, you have to go under it. There are two
ways of going under, via flying across the level then dipping under the exit
and up (of which is amazing hard) and the other way, is using Yoshi. Fly
across the level on Yoshi, then get to where the platforms just by the normal
exit are. I would advise to fly from the strip before the yellow pipe,
and then fly from there to the exit - you may dip into the chainsaws, if that
happens then land on top of them to bump onward a little. When you get there,
then jump right under the normal exit and float until you are past it, then
dismount from Yoshi so you jump up onto the ledge above (Yoshi has to bite the
bullet sadly). Now head right, collect the 3-Up Moon from the higher ledge
and go into the secret exit.

---------------
Cookie Mountain
---------------

Jump on the Koopa and the mole as they come your way, then head up the ledge
and jump over the gap and onto the blocks. Dispose of the enemy here (NOT by
jumping, but by fireball, cape spin, object or Yoshi) that is on the
blocks. Hit the highest and lone block to get a mushroom / cape feather, then
head below and hit all the blocks, which contain coins. Head right over the
gap, and to the sloped ledges area. Hit the Koopas as they come, and go on the
left most slope and grab the Dragon Coin. Head off down to the ground again,
and then collect the red shell that's to the right, and keep holding it. Head
up the slopes again and onto the right ledge, then throw it right at the
mole. Follow the shell down the ledges, and if the shell hits all the moles 
here you earn an extra life. Go right under the pipe and jump over the gap, 
then dodge the onslaught of moles as they appear from the ground and the mound.
Now go right over the blue pipe and the gap, where you will see a line of
musical note blocks above, with two enemies above. He fires down lightning
bolts, which creates large amounts of fire on the ground. Jump from the higher
ground to below the left one (while getting the Dragon Coin) to get rid of that
one, then dodge the other one and go ahead. Jump on the green pipe and
go through the checkpoint above.

Run right, and watch out for the moles that come from the ground and the wall;
and stand on the yellow blocks after till they have cleared away more. Dispose
of the remaining moles, then hit the third block from the left then climb the
vine. Get the Dragon Coin at the top, and jump off to the left onto the ledge
and hit the block to get a 1-Up green mushroom. Go back to the vine and the
blocks, then go down the dark blue pipe that's right. You will drop down into
some water; go left, and when you come to the Pukka fish, go underneath
(jumping over the first is OK, but both is not possible). Try not to go too
low to die, but more than enough to miss them. At the end is a ledge and pipe.
Up this pipe and you will appear in the sky. Jump onto the clouds that are
right, and run across it to make a 1-Up green mushroom to pop out. Jump off at
the end and you will appear in the level (near the checkpoint), so carry on
to where the blue pipe was and carry on.

Go right and if you have activated the red switch palace, walk over the gap
and hit the ? block to get Yoshi. Jump on the ledges right and get the
Dragon Coin from the top, and go right. Eat the pink berry off the hedge, over
the gap, then eat another pink berry to make Yoshi poo out a cloud. Eat
a powerup of your choice from the block on the ground, and head over the grey
pipes after. You will come to two gaps; if you have activated the correct
switch palaces you can walk over them, otherwise you have to jump. After is 
a set of ? blocks with those enemies who fire lightning; hit them from 
underneath then raid the blocks to get coins (the third from the left at the
bottom has a mushroom / cape feather). Head right; watch out for the jumping
chuck, and jump onto the block (contains a coin if you hit it), over the pipe
and into the exit to complete the level.

------------------
#4 Lugwig's Castle
------------------

Go right, then drop down and either jump on or cape spin the enemy here. Avoid
the ball and chain that's to the right, and use the stone blocks upward. Right,
and make your way through the mass of balls and chains, and then collect the
mushroom at the end and enter the door. Here, the ceiling will fall so leg it
left, over several lava pits (don't jump too high otherwise you will hit the
ceiling or a fireball) and hit the switch block to make the ceiling rise. Now
ignore the baddies and go right, over another two pits of lava and run left
while the ceiling comes down again, and if you make it in time you get to the
end in one piece. Take a breather and enter the door. 

Jump up and climb the fence upward and to the right. Head down the passage and
hit the block there for a powerup (mushroom / cape feather). Once collected,
head back to the fence and upward. You will have to jump from fence to fence
on the way up, and avoid the Koopa's as you go. Keep to the left, and at the
top is the red boss door, where you will face Lugwig.

BOSS: LUGWIG
This boss is not a problem to take down. He will start firing fireballs at
you; these are easy to avoid, so dodge them then jump on him. He will now
go into his shell and chase you, jump over him as he comes your way and keep
doing that until he stops, where he will do this weird summersault, then land,
and repeat the process (he will start firing fireballs again). Jump on him
three times to finish him off. You can also use fireballs to hurt Lugwig if 
you are Fire Mario. Save your game, then head into the next section, the
Forest of Illusion.

---------
Soda Lake
---------

An underwater level, this. Swim right, and above the black box to avoid the 
bullets that is releases. Go right, avoid the fish and hit the block to get a
powerup. When the coast is clear, head down and right. When you get to the
Dragon Coin that is in-between the black boxes, collect it then move out of the
way before you are hit, then quickly go by. Go above the school of fish that 
approach, then quickly go past the next two boxes, get the Dragon Coin, and
carry on right. Avoid the fish, and go up. Down the gap is a Dragon Coin, but
collect it while no bullets are approaching from the right. Go back up, and
carry on right; when you reach the two black boxes that are parallel to each
other, it's easier to go underneath the bottom one as you can go under the
bullet more. Right, then over the rock, collect the Dragon Coin, and right. Go
under the next box, and get the Dragon Coin (the fifth and final) above the
next box. When the line of four fish comes towards you, swim above them, and
carry on. After some more fish dodging and box avoiding, you will finally
reach a green pipe; enter it to go the land above and the exit. This then
unlocks a path to Star Road 3.

---------------
Butter Bridge 1
---------------

The camera in this level moves automatically, so keep up or be crushed. :P
Head right, and jump onto the small platform. This then goes down and the 
next one moves up, somewhat like a pulley system, so keep jumping on the spot
or jump between the two to keep at a reasonably equal level. Another one is
after, which a flying Koopa in the middle, so jump on the Koopa to dispose of
him. Jump onto the platform, get the Dragon Coin then jump quickly before the
platform falls, onto another pulley system. Use the platform to the other
side of the pulley, and jump onto the Koopa to collect the Dragon Coin and to
get onto the next log platform. Jump onto the left pulley and stay there so
that you can reach the Dragon Coin's height, then jump to the right side. If
you have activated the red switch palace then just jump onto the blocks here;
otherwise you are in for a hard time of jumping from Koopa to Koopa to
reach the log platform. Jump across several pulley systems, and on the end on
stay on the right as the screen pulls down. Get the Dragon Coin on the left
before moving on, then go right a set of yellow blocks. Go onto the log
platform underneath and hit the ? block to get a powerup, then hit the yellow
blocks to make them rotate, and use it to get up. Head right onto the left
pulley, and jump on the Koopa to the right pulley. Jump onto the platform below
grab the final Dragon Coin that's to the left quick and onto the wooden log
platform and kill some of the flying Koopas that come your way, and get down
to the bottom right when you can. Jump over the pipe and hit the block here if
you have 30 coins or above to get an extra life. Now travel into the pipe, and
jump into the exit.

---------------
Butter Bridge 2
---------------

Go right and jump on the Koopa that is swooping down towards you, then do
that same with the next one, and collect the cape feather that it leaves
behind. Go right over the two gaps, and get the shell and throw it up at the
block above to get a powerup. Head right, over the small gaps and jump onto one
of the flying Koopas to get to the Dragon Coin in the air. Onward, and run to
avoid the Koopas kicking the shells towards you and watch out for the flying 
Koopas also. After three or so of the Koopas above, there are two at the
end by the gap; jump onto a flying Koopa to get up there so you can grab
the level's second Dragon Coin. Head right over the gap and go through the
checkpoint.

Go right over several ledges and kill/avoid some of the Koopas on the way.
Hit the green ! block when you get to it to get a cape feather (if you have
activated it). Ignore the first pipe below, and head right a little then
access the second pipe. Either take the platform or the rope to get to get
coins and to get to the pipe on the other side (climbing onto the rope will
mean that you will get a Dragon Coin). Enter the pipe and go through the
waves of flying Koopa and keep going across the log platforms; when you get
to the Dragon Coin near the bottom of the screen, get it by jumping on a
Koopa when it flies underneath it (although this is risky; so ignore it if I 
was you). Now go right over a platform or two and enter the level's exit.

Forest Of Illusion 1
--------------------

Go right, and jump over and ignore the Wiggler. Jumping on Wrigger only makes
it more mad and dangerous. Jump over the gap, get rid of the red Koopa, and
hit the ? block at the top for a powerup. Go right over several gaps, and kill
the Koopas while you are there. Jump up to the higher ledge and hit the block
for a Yoshi egg. Eat the enemies in this area and go right to the springboard;
jump on it here and eat the pink berry at the top. Jump down and over the gap,
and hit the yellow block to release a 1-Up mushroom. Hit a block around it
while the mushroom is over it to knock it out, and jump over the gap while the
mushroom is dropping to collect it. Jump or eat the three Wigglers, and 
go ahead and jump into the midway checkpoint.

Dispose of the Koopa and get the powerup of your choice from the block. Onward
and watch out as enemies pop out of the blocks above. At the section of
wooden beams, use the Koopa's shells as a means of getting rid of the Wrigger's
here. When you drop off the end, this block contains a P-Balloon, which is
needed to get the secret exit (see below). Over the gap, and the two Wriggers,
jump onto the green pipe and hit the enemy off the moving platform. Jump onto
this platform and off onto the higher ledge, then jump into the exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Forest Ghost House'
Play the level until you get off the wooden beam section (see above) and hit
the ? block at the end to get a P-Balloon. Grab this and inflate, then go left
under the beam section that you just covered. Go over the flying Koopa, and 
hover over the keyhole until you return to normal. Now simply hit the ? block,
grab the Key and enter the Keyhole.

1-UP TRICK
Get to the halfway checkpoint then go ahead to the item's block, and collect
the starman that comes from it. Now quickly go right and touch all the enemies
that burst from the blocks and those on the ground, as continue right and
touch as many enemies as you can until the starman wears off. You can get 16
lives easily. Exit the level and redo this method to get loads of lives
easily. Thanks to Entor for contributing this tip!

--------------------
Forest of Illusion 2
--------------------

Another underwater level (¬_¬). Swim right and hit the green ! block to get a 
cape feather (if you have activated it) then go to down the right passage.
Wait until the fish have cleared, then go over or under the first spiked enemy,
and when the next one is at the top, go under it and around the passage.
Retreat the dodge the triangular school of fish, and head up with the spiked
enemy is to the right. At the top, grab the block to the right and throw it
at the spiked enemy that's left so you can get the Dragon Coin that it is
guarding. Go right and up when the spiked enemy is at the bottom, then drift
down, minding out for the spiked enemies that are circling the pieces of
square rock. At the bottom, head right then up (minding the fish) and hit the
? block at the top to get a powerup. At the spilt (either down or right) go
down to the very bottom, and go right, where there is a Dragon Coin at the end
of the passage. Go back up to the split and now go right, and make sure that
the two spiked enemies are at the bottom. Collect the Dragon Coin that's right,
and by the time you have done this the two spiked enemies would be at the top,
so you can go underneath them and right (thus avoiding the fish that follows).

Right, go over the two spiked baddies and go up and right past several square
rocks until you reach a passage. Get the Dragon Coin from the bottom alcove
when the spiked enemy is at the top, and carry on past the next one. Follow
the passage avoiding the spiked baddies, and go down to the very bottom, and
hit the yellow block for a mushroom. Note that to the left here is the
key and keyhole (you can head through the wall) that unlocks the secret exit.
Go right, and keep to the bottom to avoid the sleeping fish that are falling
from the top. When the ledge rises, go to the middle and swim to the exit at
the end. You can get the fifth Dragon Coin from one of the alcoves at the top,
but you would awaken the fish, which means its very much suicide.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Blue Switch Palace'
See the walkthrough to see where it is from the start. Otherwise, from the
exit, head back left and follow along the bottom. At the other end is a yellow
! block; head left through the wall where the key and keyhole is located.

--------------------
Forest of Illusion 3
--------------------

Head right, and ignore the bob-omb that is in the bubble, and go over the 
pipe and collect the levels first Dragon Coin. Jump on the Goomba and throw it
into the gap that's right, then jump over that same gap. Run past the two
bubbles and use the springboard to get over the pipe. Drop down, and jump on
then throw the Bob-omb to the right, and hit the ? block to get Yoshi. Ride,
then head down the pipe here to play the block minigame. When you exit, go
right and eat the baddies here, and collect the mushroom that comes down the
blocks. Jump onto these blocks and eat the pink berry at the top, and hit
the blocks to get some coins. Onward, jump over the gap and hit the bottom
block to make the shell hit the block above so that the springboard falls.
Take the springboard and put it next to the tall pipe that's right, and use it
to get over it. Collect the Dragon Coin in the air and jump over the gap, and
run past the yellow blocks to the midway checkpoint.

Use the block just next to the checkpoint to get the mushroom in the bubble
when it arrives, then jump over the gap. Onto the yellow pipe, then jump to
the other and collect the Dragon Coin in the air, and keep going right over
several gaps and such. At the green pipe and the blocks, hit the block next to
the pipe for some coins, and right to a mass of ? blocks (which also contain
coins), where you have to climb some of them to get a Yoshi Coin at the top.
Right, over the gap, to more revolving blocks. Hit a Goomba then throw it into
the charging chuck, and head onto the green pipe via the blocks. Here, the
exits split...

To - 'Forest Ghost House'
Drop down off the pipe and get the fifth Yoshi Coin, then go right over the
yellow pipe to finish. This then exits you to the 'Forest Ghost House'.

To - '#5 Roy's Castle'
Enter the green pipe to reach a small cave area. Smash the yellow blocks with
the spin jump (this can be done with any Mario sans Small Mario) and grab
the Key and poop it into the Keyhole. This will then unlock a path to
'#5 Roy's Castle', and the proper way to go to continue the game.

---------------
#5 Roy's Castle
---------------

Go right down the passage and drop down onto the blocks below that are above
the lava. They will then start moving on a path, and you have to stay on the
blocks while it does so. Be sure to grab the Yoshi Coin as it begins, and dodge
the fireballs that come your way too. After a while, the blocks then move
from a lava area to an area with spikes on the floor and ceiling. Collect the
Dragon Coins as you go, but watch out for the spikes that fall from the ceiling
at their positions. After this, the blocks will drop down into a gap, and at
this point you have to jump off to the ledge on the right. Go down and activate
the P-Switch (make sure that the spike above it drops first) then head right.
Wait until the fireballs come up then down first, then jump over the statue,
get the 1-Up Green Mushroom, and right to extending and contracting yellow
blocks. Hit the green ! block to get a cape feather, and make your way across
the rest, and to the red boss door.

BOSS: ROY
This is the same as the boss battle with Morton, except that the walls slowly
are closing in on the area. To hurt Roy, simply jump on his head. He will walk
left, up the wall and drop from the ceiling wherever you are standing. When he
lands you are immobilised for a second. So the tactic is when he is about to
come over you and fall, jump out of the way and then jump on him. He will speed
up when he gets hit, and after three bops to the noggin hes done for. You can
also use fireballs to hurt Roy if you are Fire Mario. After the somewhat
comical cut scene, you get the chance to save your game and you move onto
Chocolate Island.

------------------
Blue Switch Palace
------------------

This is the forth and final switch palace in the game. Avoid the P-Switch's
and collect all the coins that are in this area. Once you have done that,
activate the Silver P-Switch, and then the Blue P-Switch. Now collect all the
silver coins in the area (run back and forth as the enemies will regenerate).
Once the P-Switch's effects have gone, go to the far right and enter the pipe.
Run right as normal and jump onto the giant blue switch. Now all the blue
dotted blocks in Dinosaur Land will turn into blue ! blocks! ^_^

------------------
Forest Ghost House
------------------

Run to the right and go into the ditch and duck to avoid the ghost that's 
approaching (also face left to keep the Boo's at bay). After that, go right
and face away until the Big Boo is close enough, then jump back up to the ledge
and jump over the Big Boo and go onward. In the next open away, lure the
two Boo's on the right over to you then jump over them. Follow the linear, 
where you will reach an open area. Dodge the flying ghosts, and jump onto the
higher ledge and hit the ? blocks to get a coin, and a power up. Get the
Dragon Coin here also. Go right and through the door to a new area.

Keep on the move and jump low here to avoid the Boo's above. Go right and
hit the flying block for a powerup. Onward, over the short block walls
and hit the ? block to get a powerup and grab the Dragon Coin. Go over the gap
and you will see a Dragon Coin in the air by the ghosts; getting this might
mean you have to injured and lose your current status, so keep this in mind
(as Small Mario, its suicidal really). Keep going, and if you are Small Mario
go through the passage at the bottom and hit the yellow block for a 1-Up green
mushroom, then go back out and up via the top. Get the Dragon Coin, and go
and grab the P-Switch. Ignore the first ditch with the door, and instead
go after and break the line of coins. Hit the P-Switch and then go through
the hidden blue door that has now appeared in the far right corner.

You now appear in the first area; apart from that you are now above the passage
ways you traversed through before. Head up and left and keep going until
you reach a door; ignore that for now and go left for a little longer to get
the fifth and final Dragon Coin. Now go back to the right and enter the door
that leads to the Ghost House's exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Forest of Illusion 1'
Play the level until you get to above the first area. Go left like as you would
going to the first exit, but go past the first door and the Dragon Coin, where
you will reach another door. Enter here and get the 3-Up Moon, and the secret
exit.

--------------------
Forest of Illusion 4
--------------------

When you start, you will notice that a Lakitu is above, with a 1-Up green
mushroom on a fishing rod. You can collect this by simply jumping up to the
life; however when you do he throws spiked enemies at you in return, but there
is a way round this (sorta). Hit the Koopa ahead you and throw its shell at the 
Lakitu to dispose of him for a short while. Also you can use his cloud and fly
around for a bit.

Anyways, go right and dispose of the jumping Koopa, then use the blocks to
get over the gap. Hit the Koopa and grab his shell, then throw it underneath
the block with the mushroom resting upon it. This will make it fly over to the 
right where you can collect it in more safety. Jump right and collect the
Dragon Coin while you do so, and now get the mushroom. Hit the enemy in the
pipe, and carry on to the block with the changing powerups and get a powerup
of your choice. Go right over the gap and hit the block here for some coins,
and then go over the pipe. Get the Dragon Coin under the blocks, then raid
them for coins and a powerup. Go right over several pipes and use the extending
green pipe as a way of getting the Dragon Coin that is high up. Carry on
and when you get the midway checkpoint, use the pipe to the right of the ledge
to get up and activate it.

Head right, and go down the steps and go past the pipe in mid air (note that
the secret exit is there; see below for more details). Jump over the gap and
past the jumping Koopa. Over the three green pipes, and raid the blocks here
for coins and powerups. Seeming as the Lakitu is back (he usually is at this
point) use the blue shell here, or carry on where there is a large amount of
blocks to throw his way. Now simply carry on, collect the Dragon Coin as you
go and watch out for the Chuck on the way to the exit. Note that this exit
only sends you back to the 'Forest of Illusion 2'; the secret exit reveals
another route to the south (and eventually gets you to the Forest Fortress).

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Forest Secret Area'
Play the level as normal until you get to the midway checkpoint. From here,
head right and go down the steps and go past the pipe in mid air. Jump over
the gap and wait until the jumping Koopa goes to where the mid air pipe is,
and jump on him to gain height so you can land onto the pipe. Enter the pipe
and put the key and keyhole together.

1-UP TRICK
Start the level, grab the 1-Up Green Mushroom from the cloud Lakitu (so he
starts throwing Spiny's) and get the shell from the Koopa here and go onward
until you reach the ditch with the purple pipe on the right (after the gap).
Now throw the shell into the ditch (so it keeps bouncing from edge to edge) and
the Lakitu from the cloud and the one in the pipe on the right will throw
Spiny's at you; stay to the left of the ditch (on higher ground) and dodge the
Spiny's and you will knock up a high amount of points and lives. You can do
this until you have 99 lives (if you have the patience). Thanks to Alex
Penisman for contributing this tip!

------------------
Forest Secret Area
------------------

This level is basically about you on a platform, and flying to the right.
Well there are two platforms to choose from, and they cross paths every so
often, and the paths then take you to different things, such as a block or
a Dragon Coin. It's a short and very easy level too, so there is nothing to
sweat about here. When you begin, run to the right and jump onto one of the
platforms. Along the way you can collect coins and also you have to avoid
flying Koopas (which is easy enough). Here is a list of things that you can 
get according to the platform; when it says the cross over, if it UP then
the platform going up will get the following items after that crossover.

Start -         UP   = Nothing
                DOWN = Coins
1st Crossover - UP   = 1 Coin
                DOWN = Dragon Coin, Coins
2nd Crossover - UP   = Dragon Coin, Coins
                DOWN = ? Block, Coins
3rd Crossover - UP   = Coins
                DOWN = ? Block
4th Crossover - UP   = Dragon Coin
                DOWN = Coins
5th Crossover - UP   = Dragon Coin
                DOWN = Coins, Blue ! blocks and a yellow block (1-Up mushroom)
6th Crossover - UP   = Dragon Coin
                DOWN = Coins
7th Crossover - UP   = Level's exit; higher
                DOWN = Level's exit; lower

So use the list above to get the items you want during the level. Also, at the
end be sure that the green mushrooms beyond the exit are in sight if you want
to get bonus points and coins. Now a path unlocks to the next level, the Forest
Fortress.

---------------
Forest Fortress
---------------

The screen for the first area will move to the right automatically, and if you
don't keep up you will probably get crushed. This is very much the same like
the first Castle, where the giant crushers come from the ceiling; however
there are now spinning saws that are on set paths throughout. When you come
across them, quickly watch their pattern and direction then go past them. When
you begin, keep the left to avoid the first crusher, duck in the far right of
the next pit, and same again with the next pit, go right of the next crusher,
go either side of the next one, and to the right of the final one. Enter the
door to reach a new area.

Jump over the saw that came from the above ceiling, then go right over the
pit (after the two fireballs have jumped) and up the steps of ledges. Here,
with the pit of two saws in the ground, jump down to the right when they are
at the left so you run up the side before they get you. Hit the yellow ! block
for a mushroom, and over the pit afterwards (the order of the fireballs is the
right one then the left). At the next part, use either the stone blocks in the 
air or the ground (mind the saws; although they are somewhat easy to avoid)
and watch out for the fireballs as you go. You can wait for the fireballs
to jump then carry on if you wish to play safe. At the pit, jump across and
land on the ground, then go under the platform to avoid the above saw, then
left and up onto the platform to avoid the one coming along the ground. Go
the far right of the platform and wait until the saw falls and then jump right.
Do the same to make the next one fall down. You can if you want go up and hit
the ? block above for a powerup, but if its a mushroom then don't run after
it otherwise there is a high chance you will get caught by a saw. Afterwards,
there are two routes; run up the wall and below the line of stone blocks to
get to the boss door now, or jump onto the stone blocks and right. If you
take the boss door route, go to the boss strategy below.

If you take the route above the stone blocks, then make sure Mario is caped.
If not, get the powerup from the ? block at the top of the screen not long
back (Any Mario bar Small Mario, where you will get a mushroom). If you cannot
get a cape, turn back and go under the stone blocks and enter the boss door.
If you are, go onward. Go down off the ledge. From the left, run to the
right and fly over the giant lava pit to the right, and stay AT THE TOP all
the way across until you reach some yellow blocks, where it is safe to land.
If you don't stay at the top, fireballs will get your ass. This is kinda tough
to pull off, and you should be experienced in the art of flying. So what's the
reward? Well these yellow blocks each contain a 1-Up Green Mushroom. Nine
blocks, nine 1-Ups. Not bad, no? The boss door is here also. Enter.

BOSS: REZNOR
You are faced against four dinosaurs on rotating platforms, of which spit
fireballs your way. To kill them, hit the platform from underneath. When you
have hit all four off the platforms, the boss is over. But (a big but) is the
ground is slowly disappearing, so you must be hasty in doing this. Hit one
off as you start, and when the ground is no long under where you can hit the
dinos from below, you may have to jump onto one of the rotating platforms.
The fireballs are easy enough to dodge, and if you do this fast enough it isn't
that tough. A good idea is to knock one off, jump on his platform and take out
the others as it rotates round.

Once you have done the Forest Fortress, you unlock a path to the Star Road
and Star World 4. Now bowl onward to Chocolate Island. Ghahahaha. (?)

------------------
Chocolate Island 1
------------------

Go right and jump on the dinosaur twice to defeat him, and go right and kill
the small dinosaur that comes from the slopes. Use the slopes to get to the
ledge to the right, and run past the hedge to make a mushroom jump out. Slide
down the hill to kill the large dinosaur that's approaching. At the bottom,
kill the four or so dinosaurs and be sure the hit the flying block to get a
powerup (either a mushroom or a fire flower). Now keep going right, avoiding
or disposing of the dinosaurs as you, until you reach a yellow pipe. Collect 
the Dragon Coin next to the pipe and then enter it to be fired out of the
pipe to the right. When you land, use the springboard into the checkpoint and
over the gap. 

Go right and activate the P-Switch. Go over the pit via the used blocks that
have just formed, then up the slopes and collect the Dragon Coin at the top
of the ledge. Slide down the hill to kill several dinosaurs and get the powerup
from the flying block. Head right, jump over the gap and collect the third
Dragon Coin on the way, then hit the block to get Yoshi. Over the two yellow
pipes, and use the ! block to get to the Dragon Coin that's above it (if you
have activated the blue switch palace then get a powerup from hitting the
! block from under too). Go on and enter the second blue pipe that's right. Hit
the block to get a 1-Up mushroom, and use the dolphins as a means of getting to
the far right pipe back up to the normal level (don't touch the puffed fish in
the water on your way). When you exit, be sure to hold right and the jump
button to bounce off the flying Koopa, otherwise you will fall to your doom.
Use the springboard here to get more stars at the exit.

-----------------
Choco-Ghost House
-----------------

Go right, and jump over the moving gap and the two ghosts after it. Go right,
up the platform, then down again where you will be greeted by a pack of ghosts
and a moving platform. Go left back to the platform to dodge the ghosts, then
go forward again over the moving gap. Go past some more ghosts and another
moving gap, and up a higher level. At this point a ghost on a cloud will be
above you; don't jump too high or you might touch the flame on his fishing rod
of which leads to injury. Head to the right over and up sets of stairs until
you get to a high and low platform with a ? block. Take the lower route to
dodge the ghosts above, and hit the ? block for a powerup. Keep heading 
right now over more moving gaps and flying ghosts, until you come to the door
to the next area. (enter it!)

Now you will encounter a new sort of Boo. When you look at them, they are
blocks, which you can jump upon with safety. When you turn away, then are
Boo's and so will chase you until you run away far enough or face them again.

Go right and there will be three of these Block-Boo's ahead of you; You can
use them to get to the ? block above (contains a powerup) or you can jump onto
the block and then past them. Under the wall, and dodge the moving line of 
Boo's and go right. Now here at the top of the screen in the door that you
have to enter. There are two ways of doing this; if you are caped, then make
sure that no lines of ghosts are around and run and jump / fly up to the ledge.
If you aren't caped (which you most probably are) then keep going right to
the very end, where you will come across three Block-Boo's (and a block with
a 1-Up Green Mushroom). Lure these Block-Boo's back to where the door is, and
use them as a platform up to the ledge above and into the door, where you will
be at the exit.

------------------
Chocolate Island 2
------------------

Based on your time and coin amounts when you exit the areas, you will be taken
to different areas. I will explain how to get the normal and secret exits; as
usual, the normal is first.

The objective in this first area is to get the clear it as fast as you can. So
go right and up the ledges, and at the top, keep running right, dodging the
dinosaurs and collecting the Dragon Coins as you go. When you reach the far 
wall, drop down and enter the pipe at the bottom. As long as you got there
in some speed, you should enter an area with slopes.

In this area, just make your way right across the slopes while watching out for
the flying Koopas that wonder around them. You could bounce off from Koopa to
Koopa, and is possible to get yourself a 1-Up or two, although this is somewhat
tricky to pull off. Take your time here too; seeming as to enter the normal
exit route you have to exit this area at a time of 240 or under, where you
reach either an area with dinosaurs or mushrooms in bubbles. The dinosaur 
area just has dinosaurs that you have encountered in other Chocolate Island
levels, so make your way to the far right to the next area. In the mushrooms
in bubbles level, grab a few mushrooms for yourself and your Item Stock and
make your way to the pipe at the end. Both levels lead to the same area.

In the final area, jump onto the springboard and over the gap to the right.
Now quickly, jump up to the very top of the ledges and over the dinos to the
right, where the levels normal exit is located. This goes to 'Chocolate Island
3', the normal route; there is a secret exit, which can be found below.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Chocolate Secret'
Clear the first area as fast as you can, same with the sloped area afterwards
(see the normal exit walkthrough above if you want more details on this). If
you are fast enough, then you will enter an area with lots of Chucks. Avoid
their fire, and if you activated the Switch Palaces, use the blocks to get
past them and to the key and keyhole at the end to unlock the Chocolate Secret.
If you haven't unlocked all the switch palaces, then use the blocks that are
there, and well, you are in for a hard time.

------------------
Chocolate Island 3
------------------

Go right and jump onto the moving platform, then jump off at the ledge after-
wards. Jump on the next moving platform, and get off at the higher ledge to
get the Dragon Coin. Drop down, and go across three more moving platforms. 
At the ledge at the end, get off at the bottom (otherwise the top ledge, then
drop down right and left) and hit the ? block to get a powerup. Go right
onto a another few moving platforms. Stay on the second one for a while so
that you get the Dragon Coin at the bottom, then dispose of the Koopa in the
middle here and stay on the block until you can board the next platform. At
the top of this, jump up and enter the pipe above.

Jump off the pipe to the platform to the right, then board the moving platform
that's next to it. The platform will rotate round, and you can collect coins
that are in its path. Do it over and over again and stand in different places
(middle, far left, far right etc) to get a nice coin stash. When you are done,
jump off to the right and get the third Dragon Coin. Enter the pipe at the
far right. 

When you appear back to the normal level, you can if you want retreat back
and collect what you missed (only a powerup block and the midway point; in my
opinion its not worth the hassle) otherwise carry on going right. Go across the
moving platforms, and at the third one along, duck when you are going
underneath to avoid the enemy, and hit the block above to get a powerup (either
a mushroom or a cape feather). Jump to the next one, and collect the Dragon
Coin as you go. Go across some more, and hit the green ! block if you want for
a cape feather. When you get the final moving platform with the final Dragon
Coin, simply duck when you are going underneath to collect it. Jump off to
the right after wards, and hit the star block here (30 or more coins and you 
nab your self a 1-Up Green Mushroom). Now there are two exits here; one that
goes onward, and another that goes back to this level on the map (see the
map). See below on how to unlock them both.

To - 'Chocolate Fortress'
At the star block and the yellow block (containing the vine to the bad exit),
be sure that Mario is caped. Now run from the left of the ledge then to the
right, and jump after (or about under) the exit above and fly to the right
(watch out for the blue Koopa there too). Now carry on flying lowish to the
right, and you will come across a ledge with three blocks and another exit.
Raid the blocks for three 1-Up mushrooms, then enter the exit to go onward in
the game.

To - 'Chocolate Island 3'
To unlock this path back to this level (goes in circle on the map back to here)
then hit the yellow block that's next to the star block to make a vine appear.
Climb the vine, across the moving platform and into the exit. Now if you
haven't already, replay the level and unlock the better and proper route
onward that's above.

------------------
Chocolate Fortress
------------------

Go right (as usual) and jump between the two stakes when they are apart, and
through the next set when they have stopped moving. Jump (or walk over if you
have unlocked the red switch palace) the pit of brown lava (yes, brown) and
up the ledge when the stake is up and out of the way. Now jump across the
pit (when the stake is up), dispose of the skeleton Koopa, and hit the ?
block for a powerup (mushroom or cape feather). You may notice at this point
that fireballs start appearing; of which you have to dodge as you go. Go
right when the stake is up, and past the next two stakes when they are out
of the way. Jump down across the pit, and over the next gap to the alternating
stakes. Jump over these when the left one is lowering (as the right one at
this point is slow at rising o_0). Be sure that no fire balls are coming when
you do this though. Now go through three more stakes, and run right to the
midway checkpoint and the door to the next area.

Head right, and drop down here quickly and hold right to avoid the block that's
above to fall on you from above. Make the next one fall by standing next to
it and go past as its rising. Do the same with the next block, but move to the
left to avoid a small one jumping your way. Jump across when the small one is
on the right and the big block is rising, then carry on. Up the higher ledge,
and let the block fall and drop down the gap when its rising. Raid the blocks 
for coins and a powerup, then go right over the gap after letting the next
block drop. Drop and go past the next block (while avoiding the little jumping
one), then the same with the next one (of which is easier if you have activated
the red switch palace). At the pit of spikes, make the block drop down first,
then jump over it when it is at the bottom. The two sets of two small jumping
blocks will jump somewhat together, so they are easy enough to avoid. At the
next block, jump over the gap and under the block quickly. Do the same with
the next three blocks; jump underneath them then quickly out of there before
they fall. However the last two big blocks are stopped by ! blocks (if you
activated the correct switch palace) and the last one also has a small block
present, just make sure it jumps to the left first, then go to the middle as it
goes back, and right onward when it goes left again. Now hit the green ! block
for a cape feather, and through the boss door to face Reznor (as with every
other fortress in the game).

BOSS: REZNOR
You are faced against four dinosaurs on rotating platforms, of which spit
fireballs your way. To kill them, hit the platform from underneath. When you
have hit all four off the platforms, the boss is over. But (a big but) is the
ground is slowly disappearing, so you must be hasty in doing this. Hit one
off as you start, and when the ground is no long under where you can hit the
dinos from below, you may have to jump onto one of the rotating platforms.
The fireballs are easy enough to dodge, and if you do this fast enough it isn't
that tough. A good idea is to knock one off, jump on his platform and take out
the others as it rotates round.

------------------
Chocolate Island 4
------------------

Slide down the hill, and at the bottom, take the platform upward. Go over the
small hill, and drop down when there is a platform there. Take the platform
so that you go underneath the rock at the top right so you get the Dragon Coin.
Go right to another large area. At the bottom of this area is that brown lava
stuff, so don't fall. Wait at the ledge's edge until a platform is underneath
you, then drop down onto it, and go from platform to platform to the top right,
and jump off at the ledge. Now board another platform that goes down, and wait
when it stops for one to appear beneath you, and drop onto that. Go across 
some more to platforms to the right to get onto a grey flat one; jump off this 
quick before it falls then go up the hill to the right. Near the top, jump to
the left and collect the Dragon Coin that's located there. Carry on right, over
some jagged landscape, and jump over the gap at the end. Now if you have 
activated the blue ! blocks, then you can drop the ledge to the left and
walk across the blue ! blocks over the pit to the left to get three 1-Up Green
Mushrooms and a powerup from the yellow ! block. To get out of the pit, go
back left and use a platform up.

Go right, and ignore the used blocks below and jump onto the diagonal blocks
to the right and get the Dragon Coin. Now go back underneath the yellow blocks,
and hit the block third from the left to release a P-Switch. Activate the
P-Switch, and then go below where the used blocks where and enter the top
passage for a Dragon Coin, and the bottom one and enter the grey pipe. Here,
jump to the other side of the arrow and activate the P-Switch. Fall down, and
you will fall through lines of coins, with items in passages to the right. 
According to when the P-Switch wears out, you will land on a line of blocks
(that were coins) and collect the powerup on the right. To change the line,
either use a cape to slow your descent or after activating the P-Switch, wait
at the arrow and fall so you don't land at the very bottom. Here is a list
of items that are in the passages:

1st passage:  Coins
2nd passage:  Cape Feather
3rd passage:  Dragon Coin
4th passage:  1-Up Mushroom
5th passage:  Starman
6th passage:  Mushroom
7th passage:  Five 1-Up mushrooms
8th passage:  Cape feather
9th passage:  Fire Flower
10th passage: Coins
11th passage: Three 1-Up mushrooms
Ground:       Springboard

When you are done here, enter the pipe at the far right of the passage to exit
back to the normal level.

When you reappear, you can if you want retreat back to where the yellow blocks
and the pipe was, and redo the bonus area that you just tried. Otherwise carry
on. Jump to the rock that's right and hit the ? block for a powerup (mushroom/
fire flower). Drop down the right and jump over the pit of lava right. Carry
on right and past the Chuck on the pipe to the levels exit.

Go right, past all the used blocks containing the spiky shells to some
yellow blocks. Hit the lower middle block, and jump up to the higher ? block
to get a Yoshi egg. Move the P-Switch off the used blocks to the right (next
to the pipe) and activate it. Now enter the pipe, where you will play the
1-Up minigame. Exit when you are done to appear back in the level, and head
up the ledges to the midway checkpoint.

Jump across the extending green pipes to the right (get the Dragon Coin above
the second pipe) until you get to some yellow extending and contracting blocks.
Jump across these (aim for the middle each time) until you come across the
chuck on the pipe. Collect the Dragon Coin here if you want, but you might not
have got the others, so there isn't much point. Carry onwards, past three
more Charging Chucks to the exit. Easy (for a change ^_^).

-----------------
#6 Wendy's Castle
-----------------

Go right, past the skeleton, and wait until the giant stake drops down. When
it rises up, jump onto the second springboard up to the right ledge. Drop down,
and run right and duck in the ditch to avoid the oncoming saw. Carry on, and
jump over the next saw at the more open part of the passage, then run right and
jump onto the blocks over the lava pit, and to the other side after the
fireball has cleared. Run to the ditch and wait until the giant stakes drop,
and keep making your way right while avoiding the saws and keep stopping
between the giant stakes to prevent getting crushed. 

After this, you will come across some more saws in an open area. Jump onto the
first stone block, and go across the other stone blocks to the top right
passage when the saws are out of the way. Drop down at the end of the short
passage and hit the yellow ! block for a mushroom. Run past the first stake
when it is up, jump over the second and under the third quickly and carry on
right to the midway checkpoint and a door to the next area.

Go right and jump onto the platform when the Sparky is at the bottom, and hit
the yellow ! block for a mushroom. This is now very much like the third castle,
where the blocks move up and down at the same time and you have to use your
judgement on when to jump. It's not a tough area; just watch out for the Sparky
and big Sparky's that circle some of the platforms. When you get to the end,
hit the green ! block for a cape feather, and enter the red boss door to
face Wendy.

BOSS: WENDY
Remember the third castle's boss, Lemmy? With the pipes? Well its the same
here, expect that the pipes are all of the same size and that there are two
fireballs instead of one. Every few seconds, three things pop out of the pipes
at the same time; the boss, and two fakes. Hitting the boss means you hurt her,
and hitting a fake means they pop back in and do it again at different points.
Hitting the boss three times means she will fall through the bottom into the
lava below, and you win. Just keep an eye out for those two fireballs, and you
should be fine. Now a path unlocks to the next area; the 'Sunken Ghost Ship'.

----------------
Chocolate Secret
----------------

Jump onto the springboard in the middle of the pit of lava to get to the other
side. Go right up the passage, and hit the enemies as you go. When you exit to
an open area, jump out and go under the ledge the Chuck is on. Get on of the
shelled enemies and throw it upward at the Chuck, and do the same with the
other shelled enemy at the other Chuck on the higher ledge to the right. Go
up to the higher ledge, and slide down the hill and jump to the ledge that's 
right. Hit the ? block to get a powerup, then go past the Chuck and up the
pipe to the right of him.

Out of the cave, go right and across the floating platforms. Don't stay on them
long, as they fall. Also there enemy on the platform on the way, so either hit
or ignore him then go down the pipe at the end back to the cave area. Run and
jump to the rock above the Chuck right, then go into the midway checkpoint and
the pipe below. 

This small area is very fun. Slide down this hill (press Down) and you will
keep sliding downwards into enemies. You will gain a few 1-Up's on the way too,
and watch out for the occasional pit with piranha enemies inside. At the end,
enter the pipe. Go right up the step like ledges while watching out you don't
touch the enemies. Go across the yellow rock and to the other side, and keep
going right past more of those red enemies. After a while you will come across
another large pit of lava with yellow rocks in. Jump across all these rocks
very quickly to avoid getting sunk with them. At the other side, slide down
the hill and you will be greeted with a Charging Chuck. Hit the ? block for
a powerup, and onward past more Chucks, then to another pit of lava. Go across
the slanted yellow rocks before they sink, and get the Dragon Coin at the end.
Enter the pipe, which leads to the level's exit. On the Map, the path will
lead from out of the Valley of Bowser and to Castle #6.

 3.07. Sunken Ghost Ship
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Although this level doesn't really deserve its own area, it fits no where else
so, well, why not. Did you know that this ship is the same ship from Super
Mario Bros. 3 on the NES? Except more sunk? Well you do now.

Walkthrough
-----------

Swim to the right, and hit the ? block that's above the Bullet Bill machine to
get a powerup. Go up and right, then down after passing the crates, and enter
the yellow pipe to the right to go down inside the ship. Inside, swim up and
right while avoiding two passing ghosts. When you reach the crates, then
ghosts will appear from nowhere. You will see them just before they appear and
can hurt you, so then go into a position so that you don't touch them, and
go onward right. After a while some ghosts will come from the right, so watch
out for them, and carry on. When you see a normal Boo, then the ghosts that
appear from nowhere will stop. Keep an eye on the two Boo's here, and enter the
circle of Boo's when you can, and exit at the top. Enter the one to the right,
then exit below so you can enter the pipe. 

Now you will drop automatically and collect a Starman to make you invincible.
Keep falling and collect some items on the way. Stay to the middle and you
will land on a platform; renew your invincibility status here by hitting the
block and collecting the starman. Keep falling onward to the bottom, where
there is water and a island in the middle. Walk into the green circle with the
? on to complete the level, and to unlock the opening to the Valley of Bowser.

------------------
Valley of Bowser 1
------------------

Go right, and as long as you have activated the red switch palace, the giant
mole here will cause you no problems. Go up the ledge and watch out for the
Charging Chuck. Go right and drop down, and onward to the mass of blocks that
are blocking the passage. Take away two, and grab the third as the Charging 
Chuck smashes through them at you, then throw it at him. Carry on and hit a
block when the giant mole is on it to dispose of him. Collect the Dragon Coin
and retreat back, up and right. When you come to the hole, stand at the edge
and wait until the giant mole walks down it before continuing. At the bottom
of the step like hill onward, wait until the mole passes by and head up. At
the fork, go straight ahead, past the mole and get the Dragon Coin and the
end of the passage. Go back and now take the lower route, and then take the
higher of the two routes you are now presented with. Get past the giant mole
and jump to the passage opposite. When you reach the giant mole, retreat back
to the more open part of the passage and jump over him. Carry onward and take
the lower path of the next fork to get to the midway checkpoint, then go take
the upper path.

Get past the mole, and use the mole in the pit of piranha plants as a means of
crossing. Now head over gap (use the blue ! block below if you activated it)
to get a 3-Up Moon afterwards. Drop down the gap you just crossed, and go
right; drop down and take the higher or the two forks to get the third Dragon
Coin. You cannot exit via the gap above, but be sure to hit the invisible
blocks here as you will need to cross them later. Now go back and then up
(use the giant mole that drops down). You will come across three paths; take
the middle for a Dragon Coin, then go to the lower path. Follow the passage
and avoid the Charging Chucks that smashes through the yellow blocks. Jump
across the gap and go to the end to get the fifth and final Dragon Coin.
Retreat back to the gap you just crossed and drop down. You can, if you want,
hit the yellow block here and climb the vine that comes out of it to a pipe,
of which leads to a 1-Up minigame. However when you finish the game you come
out at a pipe under the midway gate. Otherwise, go right, past the giant mole
and mind the Charging Chuck that approaches through the blue blocks. Now
enter the pipe to the level's exit.

------------------
Valley of Bowser 2
------------------

Head right across the yellow rocks (mind the bats from above) until you get
to a ? block. If you can, grab the shell of the Koopa here and hold it, so
that the invincible shell from the top right will run into you and run into
you shell. If not, then just jump onto the ? block and carry on (its not worth
risking your life for a powerup from the block). Keep on going across more of
the yellow rocks, and you will reach a ! block with a mushroom inside. Above
the yellow block that's just to the left is a Dragon Coin, and to the right
on a higher ledge is the midway checkpoint.

*deep breath*

From the checkpoint, enter the pipe. The block ahead contains a pair of Yoshi
wings, which will take you to a Yoshi bonus area. Don't go right just yet; go
left up the ledges and at the far left of the top ledge, jump and you will hit
a block that's hidden (contains either a mushroom or a cape feather). Now go 
right to the yellow rock. Enter the passage at the bottom, and as it rises,
go as right as you can until you stop at the top. When it falls, stay where you
are so you can get the coins in the part below, and as it rises go right
through the above passage to the little opening at the top. When it falls, go
right and down, so you can get the Dragon Coin. When it rises again, go as
right as you can in this area (DON'T go down the passage yet) and when it falls
go down the passage to the pit half way across. As it rises, go right, up then
left to the Dragon Coin. Go right a little so when it drops you so straight
down to the ground and stay there when it rises. Go right at the top and as
it drops again, go down the passage to the pit halfway. When it rises go right
to the alcove at the top, and get the coins at the bottom at the drop. On the
rise, go as fast as you can to the second alcove that's right. When it drops,
go right so you are on the ground, and go right QUICKLY until the pipe is in
sight. Go up the vertical passage next to it, then right, and enter the pipe
as it goes downward. Phew.

As soon as you start, go right as quick as you can up the ledges to avoid the
rising yellow rock. Note that when you exit the passage, the yellow rock sticks
out. This is used for the secret exit (you jump on that, then up above the
screen and left). Use the moles for the next two pits to get across them, and
race across another yellow rock after. If you have activated the blue switch
palace then you are safe in the pit here, otherwise jump across to the passage
opposite or wait until the giant mole drops down. Now go right to the exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks 'Valley Fortress'
When you reach the level's third area (see the walkthrough's third paragraph)
head right when you appear to avoid the rising yellow rock. Now that when you
exit the passage, some the yellow rock sticks out. This is used for the secret
exit; you jump on that, then up above the screen and go left to a secret area,
where you will find the key and keyhole.

------------------
Valley Ghost House
------------------

Head right and get the powerup from the ? block, then jump over the gap and
get the Dragon Coin as you go. Keep going right over the gaps while staying
away from the green bubbles floating below until you get to the door at the
end, which will take you to a new area. A confusing area at that.

Well, the exit I can tell you off the bat, but I shall tell you the locations
of the other five Dragon Coins first. If you just wanna go to the exit, then
go to the next paragraph. Hit the block above you and activate the P-Switch,
and grab the Starman that falls. Run to the right, and collect a Dragon Coin
near the top on the way; keep going to a door at the end. Go left to the end
to get another Dragon Coin, then return to the door you just passed to return
to the previous area. Back at the P-Switch, activate then use a cape to fly up
to the one above; this is the hardest to get, and probably isn't worth your
time. The other one is; activate the P-Switch and go right this time. Ignore
the starman now, and go right as quick as you can to a passage with coins and
doors. If you can, get to the end of the passage so you can reach the fifth
and final door (and also a 1-Up Green Mushroom). Enter this fifth door,
activate the P-Switch and get the Dragon Coin on the right. Wait until the
P-Switch effect wears out and carry on right to the door and to return to the
previous area.

Now for the exit. Hit the block above to make the P-Switch fall, and activate.
Ignore the starman that falls and run right over the gaps till you reach
a passage with coins and doors. If you can, run to the very end; or at least
the forth door along. If you get to the end, a 1-Up Green Mushroom is awaiting
you. Enter the forth door from the left to reach the level's exit. The other
doors take to other areas that are pointless to visit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlocks '#7 Larry's Castle'
Play through the first area. At the second area (where you have the P-Switch
on the block above you) then hit the block and activate the P-Switch. Ignore
the starman that falls and run right over the gaps till you reach a passage
with coins and doors. Run to the very end; where a 1-Up Green Mushroom and a
door is awaiting you. Enter this door (which is the last one at the end).
Grab the P-Switch in front of you, and travel over the used blocks to the
other side, then go right and through the floor. Drop the P-Switch here. Drop
down the right and hit the ? block to make a trail of coins. Here's the low
down - the Key and Keyhole is at the top right corner, and you have to make a
trail of coins up there, and activate the P-Switch so you can travel up the
trail. Use the D-Pad to control the coin trail. Make it go up one or two blocks
then left, up, and then right while letting it go up every so often. Watch out
for the Boo's to the right as you do this. When its done, before you activate
the P-Switch, be sure that you are small Mario so you can fit in a hole up
there (hit a Boo or something to reduce your size). Hit the P-Switch and go
up the trail of coins, into the hole and put the Key and Keyhole together.

------------------
Valley of Bowser 3
------------------

Run underneath the pack of Koopas that are coming towards you (or jump onto
the first of the three and bounce over them) and hit the block on the higher
ledge to the right to get a powerup. Jump on the platform with the number 1 in;
after 1 second, it falls. Keep this in mind when using other platforms of this
type throughout the level. Go across two of these platforms, and jump off onto
the lower white column after. Onto the next one, and get the Dragon Coin on
the way, and keep going across more of these platforms. When you reach two
flying Koopas that are flying vertically up and down, bounce off the left one,
onto the right one, then onto the lower platform after. Get the Dragon Coin
and jump onto the platform above, and onto the white column before you slide
off. Jump onto the first platform here and get the Dragon Coin as you drop, 
then land on the 4 second platform below. Get onto the yellow pipe and play
the 1-Up minigame. Exit at the top when you are done to return to the level.

Use the springboard to the right upward into the midway checkpoint that's
above, and then move it to the right so you can hit the ? block. Use the
springboard to the right to land on one of the three platforms, and go across
the valley while avoiding the jumping Koopa's. At the other side, go down on
the platform and onto the 4 second platform. Take it and keep going to where
you can go onto either a higher and lower platform; take the lower to get the
Dragon Coin, and bounce off the giant Bullet Bill that approaches onto the
higher platforms that's left (eg. the 4 second one). Now keep taking the
platforms right (you may have to jump over some giant bullet bills on the way)
until you reach the level's exit.

------------------
Valley of Bowser 4
------------------

Head right and down under the rock with the Chuck on, and jump onto the
floating platform in the lava ahead, and run and jump off at the other end
quickly. Head up the hill and avoid the rocks on the way. Jump past the Chuck
at the top, hit the yellow ! block for a mushroom, and go across the three
platforms in the lava (mind the Koopa's; you may find it easier to jump on
them, however at the third Koopa you have to go underneath him). You can enter
the pipe here which will take you to an icy cave area, but it takes you back
to before the lava pit and all you can get is a cape feather out of it. Hit
the yellow block and climb the vine, then hit the ? block at the top to get
a Yoshi egg. Mount, then drop down the hole and hold right to avoid dropping 
into the lava below (the other way from the top; where you spin jump down the
yellow blocks only gets you a 1-Up green mushroom, of which is hard to obtain).
Go over the three platforms in the lava, and onto the ledge after (mind the
rocks coming from the Chuck above though). Now go right onto the platform in
the lava, and jump through the midway checkpoint.

When the coast is clear, go under the stone column and past the Chuck onto
a platform in the lava; then onto a yellow ! block. Hit the ? block above for
a powerup, then to the ledge. Go along the ground (so you are under the other
ledges) and head up the passage. Drop down onto the platform in the lava
when no rocks are falling, up the hill, and down the other side. Jump onto the
platform, and over the Chuck. Use the flying Koopa as a bouncing boost to the
platform after it, and jump to the next platform when no rocks are falling.
Carry on to the springboard on the block (if you have activated the blue switch
place, go onto the far right one to avoid the rocks). Jump onto the springboard
and past the Chuck onto a platform below it. Now go onward to the exit.

SECRET EXIT: Unlock 'Star World 5' and 'Front Door'
Play the level to the end and have Yoshi with you. Just before the exit is
the key and keyhole, except that the key is trapped in the hole. Make Yoshi
eat the key and just walk into the keyhole.

-----------------
#7 Larry's Castle
-----------------

Go right and board the blocks, of which start moving on a path. Keep up with
it. On the path are balls and chains that will cross your path; these are
easy enough to avoid. At one point, where you reach two used blocks, when
the blocks go straight up use these two blocks to keep up with 'em. When it
turns in at the top, jump on it again (also get the Dragon Coin on the right
quickly). Shortly after the path of blocks will go under another line of
blocks - just keep up with them and reboard at the other side, where it will
go along the top (pick up the Dragon Coin and mushroom from the ! block here).
Towards the end before the spiked passage, don't be worried that the blocks
go down just before it; they will come up again soon. Collect the third
Dragon Coin, and when the blocks go down, DON'T jump off to the door, but
stay on at the end. Why? Cos at the bottom is the midway checkpoint, two
Dragon Coins and a mushroom. :D Enter the door.

Go right and dispose of the two skeletons. Head towards the two stakes, and
you will be greeted with your good friend, the Magi-Koopa. Dispose of him
for now to stop him bothering you for a while, and go under the two stakes.
Get rid of the skeleton here, and wait until the Magi-Koopa reappears. Dodge
his attacks so that they hit the blocks so they create gaps you can go through.
Hit the block to get a powerup, then past some more stakes. You will come
across another wall of blocks, wait until the Magi-Koopa does his magic to
create a path, and go past the sets of stakes. Jump over the pit of lava,
and head over the yellow blocks and watch the stakes and fireballs on the way.
Keep going until you reach a green ! block (cape feather) and the red boss
door.

BOSS: LARRY
This is the same as the very first boss, but you have three fireballs that
appear from the lava below to add to the fun. This battle takes place on a
platform that tilts left and right, and you have to hit Larry into the lava
either side of the area. He will attack by throwing fireballs, of which are
easy to avoid. Jumping on Larry will make him move down the side its tilting.
So, when it is tilting one side, jump on him once or twice to make him go to
one end, leave him when it tilts to the other side, and then hit him off when
it reverts back to the first side again. You have now completed all the
castles! Just the final level now...

----------
Front Door
----------

This is it; the final level in the game (or the Back Door), where you will
face up to Bowser at last and get the Princess back. Let's book.

You start in a hallway, and you have four doors to choose from. Look at the
walkthroughs for all four below and decide what's best for you to take,
otherwise take one at random. I would advise that you take door number 2.

DOOR 1
This area consists of the screen moving automatically, with the giant crushers
too. As always, keep up or be crushed. If you have activated all the switch
palaces in the game, then this area will become a whole lot easier. Stay to the
left of the first crusher, left or FAR right with the second (use the block if
you activated it), and the left at the last one (or you if you are to the
right, enter the door before the crusher falls down).

DOOR 2
This area consists of fences that you have to climb. Jump up and hang onto the
fence, and head to the right to the far door. All you have to look out for
are Koopas on your side and fireballs. Quite easy.

DOOR 3
This area is different to what you have been used to throughout the 
adventure, but anyway.. you will meet Mecha-Koopa's here too. Just jump on
them to stop them temporally. When you start, go ahead a little and jump up
through the second panel at the top (it has a larger diamond pattern).
Jump up another here just to the left, and go right and up another one. Head
to the right until you drop down, then down the next one that's right, and
go right down again. Now just go right to the door.

DOOR 4
Go right and drop down onto grey block below, and jump off to the right ledge
after it moves. Jump onto the top block and drop down to the one underneath,
and simply go across the rest of the platforms to the door at the other side.
Just be sure that you avoid the Spark's and Big Spark as you go.

After you have completed one of the four levels, you are presented with another
hallway, with four more doors (numbered 5 to 8). Look at the walkthroughs for
all four below and decide what's best for you to take, otherwise take one at
random. I would advise that you take door number 5.

DOOR 5
Wait until the giant stakes drop down, and when they start rising and you can
start running, do so straight to the end. With some luck, you will make it to
the door without being crushed by the Thumps and the giant stakes. 

DOOR 6
A happy happy underwater section. Swim right and then up before the spikes 
appear from the right. Avoid the skeleton here and when the wall moves to the
right, swim up and hit the ? block for a powerup. Go up through the spiked
passage at the right time, and head through the mass of balls and chains.
Head through another spiked laden passage and enter the pipe.

DOOR 7
This area has statues of Bowser in your path. The grey ones simply spit fire-
balls, however the golden coloured ones will jump after you (touching these
equals injury). Just make your way across to the end where the door is.

DOOR 8
Jumping Chucks litter this area. When they shake, they are about to jump, so
stand next to them if you can. Go past the first two, and jump onto the block
and get hit the green ! block for a cape feather. Carry on to the higher ledge
just ahead and float across the other Chucks to the door.

After you have completed an area within doors 5 to 8, then you will come
across the next area (dark and not too taxing) before facing Bowser.
Go right, and hit the red ? block to activate the light above. Head up the 
steps, and jump on the black enemy at the top and then run and jump over the
lava pit at the bottom after it. Jump on the black enemy here, and jump on the
Mecha-Koopa on the higher ledge then use it to kill the next two enemies.
After a few more enemies, keep going right until you get to the red boss door.
Get ready... this is it. The boss solution is at the end of the section,
after the Back Door.

---------------
Valley Fortress
---------------

Head right quickly and stop at the green ! block to get a cape feather, and
wait until the giant stakes have fell then rose before progressing. At the
drop, aim to jump down and press right to land at the ledge safely (or simply
float down with the cape). Go right and watch out for the brown spikes that
drop from the ceiling, and also the skeleton baddies. After this, jump past
the giant stake after it has dropped and stay on the platform after until the
next has dropped. This where you will be faced with THREE in a row; of which
is very hard to get past. Start going when its rising and go like the wind
(don't float down if you still have the cape) and with some luck, you will
reach the other side. Jump to the platform over the lava and get the mushroom
from the yellow ! block, and go onward over two more platforms (watch out for
the fireballs in-between them). Now is another hard bit; the stakes here go
down at a quick speed, so you will need haste in jumping between platforms.
Run and jump when they are rising and be sure to monitor the fireballs patterns
to insure that you stay alive until the end, where you reach the red boss door.

BOSS: REZNOR
You are faced against four dinosaurs on rotating platforms, of which spit
fireballs your way. To kill them, hit the platform from underneath. When you
have hit all four off the platforms, the boss is over. But (a big but) is the
ground is slowly disappearing, so you must be hasty in doing this. Hit one
off as you start, and when the ground is no long under where you can hit the
dinos from below, you may have to jump onto one of the rotating platforms.
The fireballs are easy enough to dodge, and if you do this fast enough it isn't
that tough. A good idea is to knock one off, jump on his platform and take out
the others as it rotates round.

---------
Back Door
---------

The Back Door is the Front Door but without all the doors at the beginning,
and skips straight to the last area that's dark before fighting Bowser.
Go right, and hit the red ? block to activate the light above. Head up the 
steps, and jump on the black enemy at the top and then run and jump over the
lava pit at the bottom after it. Jump on the black enemy here, and jump on the
Mecha-Koopa on the higher ledge then use it to kill the next two enemies.
After a few more enemies, keep going right until you get to the red boss door.
Get ready...

FINAL BOSS: BOWSER
This boss has different waves of attacks, which all revolve around throwing
Mecha-Koopa's at Bowser to hurt him. He will throw down two Mecha-Koopa's
in the wave, so jump on one to flatten it and then pick up and throw it upwards
so it comes down onto Bowser himself. He will move around, so you may have to
throw it several times before you hit him. Once you have done a wave, then
he will disappear briefly and fire will rain down onto the area. Stand between
one of the flames failing, or avoid them all together. They will disappear
quickly, then the Princess will appear from the clown-mobile and throw down
the mushroom (you can have one in your item stock) and the next wave will
begin. Here are all the waves explained.

WAVE 1
He will simply swing from side to side in the area, and will throw down two
Mecha-Koopa's at some point. Jump on one (preferably at the side, as he doesn't
swoop down there) and throw it up so it lands on Bowser. Do the same to the
other one to start the next wave.

WAVE 2
He will hover above where Mario is, and will turn upside down and drop a large
ball onto the ground. It's best to stand still while Bowser is hovering and
when he starts turning upside down, run out of the way to dodge the ball,
then jump over it as it approaches you. After several balls have dropped
he will then throw two Mecha-Koopa's; jump on one and throw it upward, then do
the same to the other Mecha-Koopa.

WAVE 3
Bowser will bounce along the ground after Mario, and eventually throws out
a couple of Mecha-Koopa's. The bouncing is easy enough to dodge; just run under
Bowser when he starts going upward. It's harder when you are jumping then 
throwing the Mecha-Koopa's, as you have to be hasty. Try and jump and grab
them at the other end or away from Bowser and throw it when he approaches.
If you leave one crushed one on the ground and Bowser bounces on it, it will
disappear (but he will throw another in soon, so not to worry).

When you have defeated his last wave, then you are done; Bowser has been 
defeated! Now watch the ending and give your self a pat on back. Nice work.
But you are not done yet... you haven't got all 96 level's yet, right? Get
cracking!

 3.09. Star World
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The Star World is a secret area in the game that has five extra levels. It
also enables you to go from one area to another quickly due to the Star Road's,
and it unlocks another secret area. Here is how to get to each of the Star
World levels -

Star World 1 - Donut Secret House (Secret Exit)
Star World 2 - Vanilla Secret 1 (Secret Exit)
Star World 3 - Soda Lake
Star World 4 - Forest Fortress
Star World 5 - Valley of Bowser 4 (Secret Exit)

To go to the next Star World level, you have to exit via the secret exit to
unlock to the path to it. But to get all 96 levels, you have to complete the
level by the normal and secret exits. Happy trails, Hans.

Collect the mushroom and drop down onto the blocks below. Now seeming as the
level is just lots of blocks that you have to smash through, I think an ASCII
diagram is in order. One X = a block, and is accurate (apart from the spacing
after the blocks to save room on the diagram, and the enemies might be out of
place due to that they move about).

Enter the pipe at the bottom right corner to reach the level's exit. This just
completed the level... to actually carry onto the next path, then you have
to unlock the secret exit (see where the Key and Keyhole are on the map above).

------------
Star World 2
------------

An underwater level; the joy. Head up and right when you begin, and nab the
Starman that is sinking. At the bottom is a Yoshi egg, and will hatch. Grab
the baby Yoshi and swim into fish to make him eat them. After five fish, the
baby will grow into a big Blue Yoshi which you can ride on. Head right and in
and out of the sleeping fish (if you have invincible then you don't need to
worry about waking them up). Go over the school of fish in are in an arrow
shape, and go onward. The ? block has a coin, and wait here until the sleeping
fish to the right have sunk for a bit, then go over them and onward. Some of
them might carry on chasing you if you have woke some up, just go as quick as
you can and go round them if they get too close (or eat them if you have
Yoshi). Keep going, go under some more sleeping fish, and you will reach a
pipe. Enter it, and you will appear next to the level's exit.

SECRET EXIT
When you get the pipe at the end that leads to the normal exit, take the
passage underneath instead. At the end of the passage is a Key and Keyhole.

------------
Star World 3
------------

By far the easiest normal exit in the game. Run to the right, and its there.
No worries.

SECRET EXIT
Ignore the Yoshi and the silver P-Switch (they are not needed; although you
can grow Yoshi up and use him for a later level, or when the area is littered
with the spiky shells use the P-Switch for the silver coins) and head right
to where the diagonal line of blocks are. Pick up a block from below and
throw it up when the Lakitu is around the top of the diagonal line of blocks.
Go up the blocks and jump into the cloud that remains and head upward to
a new area. Hit the ? block on the left and carry it over to the Keyhole on
the right.

------------
Star World 4
------------

Before starting, the walkthrough is done that you grow the Yoshi at the start
and use him throughout, as it is easier if you play the level that way.
Head onto the higher ledge ahead, grab the baby Yoshi and jump onto the moving
platform and jump off onto the ledge afterwards. Eat the two Koopas here,
go across the next moving platform and eat the two Koopas on this ledge after.
Jump onto one of the lower ledges afterwards and eat a blue Koopa, and fly
under the line of flying Koopas just ahead, and hit the ? block after for
a snazzy powerup. Keep going onward over more ledges and moving platforms etc
until you reach a stone block area with an upside down pipe. Eat the red shell
here and throw fireballs at the shell and Koopa. Head past the two green pipes
(jump across the middle to avoid the Koopa's) and go onwards. After more of
the same you have come across, you will reach the level's exit.

SECRET EXIT
Play the level up to the point where you reach the stone block area with an
upside down pipe. Dismount off Yoshi, and grab the red shell. Head back left
and drop off the end onto the green ! blocks, and go right onto some red !
blocks (you need these both activated, by the way :P). Throw the shell at the
? block on the ground, then put the key in the keyhole.

------------
Star World 5
------------

Head right over the platforms, and jump between them with some haste due to
their falling tendencies. Use the Koopas to bounce off if it goes pear shaped.
When you get to the ledge with the P-Switch and ? block on, hit the ? block
to make a trail of coins appear. Control it so that it goes right, then down
to near the bottom of the screen and right until it stops. Hit the P-Switch now
and go across the trail. Avoid the flying Koopas, and hit the middle block of
the three yellow blocks to get a 1-Up mushroom. Carry on over some dropping
platforms, where you will come across a baby Yoshi. Grab it and use it to
eat up enemies that you come across. Go past the four pipes (you can get
enough enemies here to make baby Yoshi grow) and head across more dropping
platforms. Jump off the last one and hold right to land on the ledge, and eat
the red Koopa and spit out the fireballs at the two enemies ahead. Go up and
eat the enemies here, and head right to the level's normal exit.

SECRET EXIT
Play the level until you reach the P-Switch and ? block. Hit the block and
straight away press right so the trail goes right only. After the effect has
warn out, hit the P-Switch and head across the trail to the end, where there
are four yellow blocks. Hit the third across from the left and climb the vine
that appears from it. At the top, jump off and run right across the ! blocks
(if you have activated the correct coloured switch palaces) and you will
eventually come across the key and keyhole. Now head onto the new Star Road
on the hill to reach...

 3.10. Special
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These levels are very VERY hard (more so than others) and most have a bit that
will drive you mad as you try to do it. It lucky lets you save every two 
levels. I would advise to bring along a lot of lives with you (from the Top
Secret Area or something) before tackling them, cos you will waste through them
like buggery. Also, a cape feather on you and in stock help a lot, along with
Yoshi, so you can eat enemies as you go and drift down to make the jumps easier
with the cape.

Hit the information block to receive an encouraging message (well, sorta).
Bounce up the two bouncy bean things and hit the second block from the left.
Climb up the vine and hit the block at the top, and jump up and grab the
Dragon Coin. Drop down to the bottom and now hit the forth block from the left.
When you stop, get the Dragon Coin that's right, and also go left and hit the
block to get a P-Switch. Grab it and go right and up via the musical blocks.
Hit the block above for a powerup, then jump up to the used block that's left,
and head up and right over the wall. Activate the P-Switch here, and drop down
and hug the right most wall where you will stop on a ? block next to a pipe.
Enter the pipe, and go right to get three Dragon Coins, then run to the right
of the pipe to get three more lives. Run and jump up the ledge above and
activate a P-Switch, and grab the silver P-Switch. Go right past the pipe and
head across the ? blocks. Hit the enemy off the flying blocks and jump onto
them, then onto the ledge to the right. Now a Lakitu will appear above, and
throw down those spiky baddies. Use the silver P-Switch here to turn the
spinies into silver coins. When you are done, head into the exit that's right.

-------
Tubular
-------

Jump onto and past the Chuck ahead. Go past the next pipe (watch out for the
piranha) and run and jump into the Dragon Coin and over the chuck. Go over
the yellow pipes and activate the P-Switch. Now quickly drop down and left
onto the springboard, and hit the ? block and collect the P-Balloon that comes
from it. Float and get the Dragon Coin that's under the block, and go up
and collect the Dragon Coin above the Chuck on the block. Hit the ? block just
to the right and renew your inflatingness with the P-Balloon. Head through the
flying Koopas and collect the Dragon Coin that are between the volcano flowers
when the coast is clear. Go onward, past the yellow pipe and under the Chuck
so you can get another P-Balloon. Now watch out for footballs from the above
Chuck when getting it, cos unless you are prepared, one WILL hit you. I
recommend that you wait until one has been throw and gone, then hit the block
and get the P-Balloon. Hit the block that the Chuck above is resting on (for
safety sake, and for revenge) and go under the next to volcano flowers, and
onto the exit. Save.

--------
Way Cool
--------

Go right onto the platform, and it will begin moving. Hit the OFF button to
switch the path of the platform, and collect the Dragon Coin on the route.
Jump over the oncoming saw and hit the next switch to make the path go up.
Jump between the two enemies when they are opposite each other (one north one
south) and hit the ? block for a powerup. Ignore the next two switches and
carry on. Jump over the two enemies that are circling, get the Dragon Coin 
and jump over the saw. Hit the next switch, and at the end of the path jump up
to get the Dragon Coin above. After landing on a ledge, go right until you
reach a rope section (the ? block on the way contains wings for Yoshi). 

On the first two ropes when the enemies are getting near, jump upward then go
back onto the rope again. Jump onto a moving platform (again jump when the
enemy is getting near) and onto the next rope. Go down after the first enemy
path and get the Dragon Coin below the second, then go up again and onto the
circling platform after. After avoiding the enemy, jump off onto the ledge
after and then onto another rope. Avoid the first set stay high, then high,
low, high, low, the middle (through the two), and low through the last three.
Jump off and go through the exit.

-------
Awesome
-------

Head right over the invisible Koopa and onto the expanding yellow blocks to
safety (aim for the middle as always). Go right into the half pipe like area,
and dispose of the Rex. When you go to the right side a Koopa kicks a shell in;
either jump on the shell or get out of the half pipe and onward. In the next
half pipe, get rid of another two Rex's and get the Dragon Coin. Another Koopa
will kick a shell into this one too. Go into the next half pipe, and get the
powerup from the ? block in the middle, and get out to the right quick as an
invincible Koopa comes along. Kill the Rex, slide down the slope and jump over
the water and get the Dragon Coin on the way. Watch out for another shell,
and dispose of the Koopa that kicked it. Pick up the P-Switch just jump over
the water, then head right past plenty of Koopas and Rex's, where you will
reach an area with purple archways.

Activate the P-Switch then use the blocks to get to the ? block above to get a
Starman. If you get it then you can go plain sailing for a while. Watch out as
fish fly out from below for a while. Go over the gap and get the fire flower
and dispose of the Rex. Wait here until a giant Bullet Bill flies over your
head, then go onto the four blue blocks (get the Dragon Coin) and onto the next
purple archway platform. Go to the far edge and wait until the giant Bullet
Bill comes and goes, and jump onto the lone block. Get the Dragon Coin above
and jump right. Go across this ledge, and run and jump up to the tallish blue
pipe. If you are invincible this can be done easy, but if you are not, then you 
might have to watch out for the fish. Jump onto the next pipe, and then there
are two blocks ahead. I found it VERY hard to go across both, so what I did
was run and jump to the second one and then onto the purple archway platform
after. At this point, the fish stop coming up (phew), and if you are invincible
the wait here until it wears out. Jump onto the flying Koopa, into the fifth
and final Dragon Coin and onto a blue block. Jump onto the ledge to the right,
slide down the slope and into the exit to end the madness. Save (please).

------
Groovy
------

Get the shell from the Koopa and throw it at the ? block ahead on the ground
to get Yoshi. Get the Dragon Coin, and go right under the slopes to avoid the
Koopa sliding off. Eat the green Koopa and throw it ahead to get rid of the
three others after it, then go onward and eat the Pokey. Avoid the piranha
plant that comes from the hedge and jump over the gap onto the higher ledge
when the volcano plant above has spat out its fireball things. Get a powerup
from the block that you can and go onward. Head through a mass of Pokeys, and
get the Dragon Coin under the Volcano plant. Go past another Pokey and either
eat the bottom volcano plant or jump over it. Past a few more Pokeys and 
jump onto the pipe in the middle of the gap (when the plant is not present)
and get the Dragon Coin when you jump to the other side. At the ledges, eat one
of the Pokeys and travel upwards behind them, and onto the blue pipe. Go onto
the sloped ledge, and run and jump right so you bounce off the Chuck and
getting the Dragon Coin above him. Eat the Pokeys and volcano plant here and
get the fifth and final Dragon Coin. Now just head past the yellow pipes with
Chucks on and the exit is there. The Chucks are hard to pass, so if you have
Yoshi, go left so they stop throwing baseballs, then run and jump to near the
first one and dismount so you fly over the second Chuck and to the exit. 
Otherwise you will have to be very careful in passing them.

Mondo

Swim to the right, and go under or over the two fish. Hit the enemy off the
flying platform then jump on it, and onto the ledge with the coins on. Jump
to the yellow pipe when the plant is not there, and the water level will rise.
Go right and hit the ? block for a powerup, and go onto the blue pipe to the
right. Wait until the water level sinks to below ground level, and drop down
and hit the enemy off the flying platform, and jump onto it yourself. Jump
down and collect the Dragon Coin when the water level rises again, then go onto
the green pipe. Swim right and hit the highest of the three diagonal blocks
to get a Yoshi egg. Go right to the ledges, and get the Dragon Coin at the top.
Go onward to the two blue pipes, and enter the lower of the two.

Go right down the cloudy slope and collect the coins on the way. Get the Dragon
Coin at the bottom, and enter the pipe. Go right and keep going until you
reach two long lines of ? blocks. When the water level sinks, eat or jump on
the fish and get the Dragon Coin at the bottom. Raid the blocks to get coins
and a fire flower on the top row, and coins on the bottom row. Head right,
and take on the enemy on the flying platform (probably best when the water
level is low so you move there faster). Get the Dragon Coin here too, and head
to the higher ledge and enter the pipe to reach the level's exit. Save.

----------
Outrageous
----------

Note: This level is so much easier with Yoshi. So get him. The easiest way to
get a fresh Yoshi is to go back to 'Groovy', get the shell from the first Koopa
and throw it at the first block to get him. Then press Start then Select to
exit the level, then go and play this one. It's very tough, and Yoshi has his
uses here. Get a feather also. Or two.

Jump over the Wiggler and over the gap. Now you will come across jumping flames
which is your touch, you get hurt (like everything else nasty looking). They
will leave behind a small flame in their wake, so avoid these too. Its hard to
see them due to the trees in the foreground, so only jump to where you are sure
that there are no flames. Yoshi, thankfully, can eat the bigger jumping flames,
but he can be still injured by the smaller ones. Take your time. After a
Wiggler and a Dragon Coin, you will come across a ? block with a powerup in.
Watch out for the Bullet Bill machine to the right. Take the springboard that's
at the base, and use it to get onto the Bullet Bill machine that is after this
one. Wait until it is safe to jump down, and go past the next machine. Carry
on, get the Dragon Coin, a Wiggler and  a group of the machines to a pipe.
Watch out for the piranha plant from this and the machine that's right and get
the Dragon Coin when the flames after is are not in the way. Use the
springboard to get over the group of machines here. Drop down from the highest
one so you are in-between two of them and eat the Springboard to the left.
Go past the Wiggler and onto the machine after, and bounce off another Wiggler
over the two machines on top of another. Go over the gap and spit the spring-
board out at the base of the orange pipe, then go on top of the pipe.

Drop down and eat / avoid the two Wigglers, then head right and knock the
enemy of the moving platform. Board the moving platform and jump onto the pipe.
Drop down, and the yellow blocks here start exploding and enemies come from it,
as well as flames on the ground. If you have Yoshi eat the lot of them, other-
wise tread carefully. There is a Dragon Coin here too. Go over the first orange
pipe and watch out for the Wiggler here, and hit the ? block for a Yoshi egg.
Go onto the green pipe, then onto the higher ledge and off the other side.
There is another enemy on a moving platform here, so knock him off (mind the
Bullet Bill machine to the right though) and get onto it and then the tall blue
pipe. Drop down and watch out for the flame, hit the three ? blocks for coins
and a powerup. Head over the pipe, past another flame and Wriggler and another
pipe. Head right and over the bullet bill machine. Here is the fifth and final
Dragon Coin, a Wriggler and an enemy on a flying platform. I would get the
Dragon Coin and hit the enemy, and use the Wriggler to bounce upon to the 
platform. Now jump off the right to the levels exit. Congrats, you done
what's in my opinion the hardest level in the game!

-----
Funky
-----

Go right straight away to avoid the flames from the enemy above. When the plant
is not there, jump onto the pipe beyond the gap. Go past the flying Koopa and
under the rock block ledge above when the coast is clear. Jump over the gap
onto the Koopa, and use the shell that's left behind on the Koopa ahead. Go
over the gaps (get the Dragon Coin on the way) and get the shell from the Koopa
ahead to throw at the ? block above to get a Yoshi egg. Ignore him for now; we
will come get him later. Go right, and hit a ? block that the enemy is resting
on to dispose of him. Raid the blocks for coins, then jump up and go right.
Hit the first block to release a P-Switch, and hit the ? block to the right for
a powerup. Activate the P-Switch and go back to where Yoshi was, and as long
as you got egg from the block, he will be on the ground waiting. Clear the
Koopas here and run and jump right onto the ? blocks. Get rid of the enemy
above, then spin jump on the rotating yellow blocks to below. Get the Dragon
Coin to the left, and go right. Over the gap, and you will come across some
Chucks. Head past them, get the Dragon Coin on the way, and go over the two
sets of blue blocks.

Hit the enemy off the musical blocks, and go past the yellow block and ? block
(just has coins, and you are in a sort of rush). Go ahead and get the shell
from the Koopa and throw it at the Chuck after it. Go onward, past more Koopas,
hit another enemy off some blocks, and keep going. Get the forth Dragon Coin
when going across the gaps, but watch out for the Chuck on the ledge after.
Go right and drop down, past the Koopa and hit the ? block for a powerup. Past
another Koopa, and throw a blue block up to the flying block above to get a 
1-Up Green Mushroom. Go right and quickly up the ledges so you avoid the
Chuck's baseball fire, and then over the top one and right. Run right, and
you will go past coins that spell out 'YOU ARE A SUPER PLAYER !!', then you 
reach the level's exit. Save, then enter the final Star Road to reach a new
world...

Alternate World
---------------

***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***

So, what is this Alternate World then? Well for one, it isn't a new area. No
new levels or anything like that. Instead, the Dinosaur Land map has a
different colour pallet. This includes all the sub areas too, like the Vanilla
Dome and the Forest of Illusion. The levels themselves stay the same colours
however.

The only other difference is that three enemies change their appearances.
These are the Koopa, Jumping Piranha Plant, and the Bullet Bill; three regulars
in the Mario series. Here are the changes, both name and an image -

Koopa = Mask Koopa
http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special3.png

Jumping Piranha Plant = Jumping Pumpkin Plant
http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special1.png

Bullet Bill = Pidgit Bill
http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special2.png

That's about it. A worthy reward for completing the Secret area? Probably. It's
not bad; however you cannot change the colour scheme back to what it was, and
the enemies will stay the same too. Well, its better than the reward you get
for getting 120 shines in Super Mario Sunshine, right?

                  4. GETTING TO BOWSER'S CASTLE IN 11 LEVEL'S
                -----------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

There is a way to get to Bowser's Castle (well, the Front Door) in only 11
levels! (the 12th is the Front Door). This section will tell you how to get to
the Front Door in 11 levels and what routes to take. I would advise doing this
after completing a normal game, as some of the level's are hard to complete.
I will not put the walkthroughs here, as they are in the main walkthrough
already. This is a nice extra challenge for Mario masters to attempt.

Before we start, I would like to say a HUGE thanks to anomie, of whom
discovered how to get to Bowser's Castle as quick as this and gave me the
permission to report his findings in this section. Thank you!

These are the level's and exits you must complete -

• Yoshi's Island 2
• Yoshi's Island 3
• Yoshi's Island 4
• #1 Iggy's Castle
• Donut Plains 1 (Secret Exit)
• Donut Secret 1 (Secret Exit)
• Donut Secret House (Secret Exit)
• Star World 1 (Secret Exit)
• Star World 2 (Secret Exit)
• Star World 3 (Secret Exit)
• Star World 4 (Secret Exit)

Now take the Star Road after Star World 4 and before Star World 5 to reach
the Front Door, aka, Bowsers Castle.

                             5. 96 LEVEL CHECKLIST
                           -------------------------
===============================================================================

If you want to complete the game 100%, then you will have to complete all 96
levels. This means that you have to find and complete every exit there is,
normal and secret. It's hard to tell what exits that you have done, and so
I have created a checklist so you can see what level's exit's you have missed.
The Bowser's Castle levels, Front Door and Back Door, don't count on the list
as they don't save after you have completed them. The amount of level's that
you have completed can be found when you start the game and load your file.

                              --------------------
===============================================================================

This is a listing of all the enemies in Super Mario World, with a description,
an link to an image on the net, how to defeat them and possible variations.
They are all put into different categories, but remember that they are not
inclusive to that area, and may also pop up somewhere else.

Here are the links to the images. These link you to screenshots of the groups
of enemies, and if you are planning on printing out the FAQ, then you may, if
you wish, print off these pictures.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 6.01. Staple Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are enemies that appear in most areas (eg. Koopa's) and other enemies
that are normal and don't really fit into their own categories (such as Rex's,
Wrigglers, and Lakitu's).

-----
Koopa
-----

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple1.png
Description:   A turtle-like enemy with big eyes, and walks on two feet. Just
               walks about, picking fights with old people and other Koopas.
               The bread and butter of Mario games.
How to defeat: Jump onto the Koopa once to pop him out of his shell, and jump
               onto the Koopa itself to defeat him. You can use the shell to
               throw and guard yourself with. You can defeat a Koopa in one hit
               of the Spin Jump, and can be eaten by Yoshi. A fireball and cape
               spin kill too.
Variations:    There are four different colours; green, red, blue and yellow. A
               Blue Koopa tends to walk faster than the other colours. You can
               also get a Koopa without a shell which can become a normal Koopa
               when it finds a shell. If it finds a yellow shell, then it will
               become invincible. There are winged Koopas too, which can fly.
               Hitting one once will make them lose their wings, and become a
               normal Koopa. Also, when Yoshi eats the different colours of
               Koopa, different effects happen. Eating green will spit out a
               green shell, red spits out fireballs, yellow means when he jumps
               sand clouds appear, and blue means he can fly.

               The Koopa also undergoes a change in the Alternate World; it 
               becomes the 'Mask Koopa'. An image of the change is below -
               http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special3.png

-----------
Super Koopa
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple4.png
Description:   Koopa with no shell, but with a cape instead, thus  giving him
               the ability to fly. Tends to run and then fly off. So its like
               Superman, but without the outside briefs deal going on. 
How to defeat: A simple jump to the noggin will make him lose his cape, making
               him a naked (ahem) Koopa. A spin jump will kill one straight
               out, and Yoshi can eat them.
Variations:    Some have a flashing red cape, and when jumped on, release a
               cape feather. Nice.

---------------------
Jumping Piranha Plant
---------------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple4.png
Description:   Dwelling in the pipes, they jump out every so often and are
               harmful to touch.
How to defeat: Wait by the pipe until the plant has returned into the pipe, and
               proceed over it. If you stand on the pipe when the plant is
               inside, the plant will not come up and bite you in the ass, but
               will stay put in there. A fireball, cape spin will defeat it as
               well as Yoshi's eating powers.
Variations:    You may find one in a hedge, and some also spit out a fireball
               to the left and right mid jump.

               The Jumping Piranha Plant also undergoes a change in the
               Alternate World; it  becomes the 'Jumping Pumpkin Plant'. An
               image of the change is below -
               http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special1.png

-----------
Bullet Bill
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple3.png
Description:   A black bullet with an eye and arm, they fire from Bullet Bill
               machines (see image) and in certain levels appear from the
               sides of the screens. Harmful to touch at all sides bar the top.
How to defeat: Jump on top of it to defeat. Also can be cape spinned and eaten
               by Yoshi, otherwise avoid.
Variations:    Comes from machines or the sides of the screen.

               The Bullet Bill also undergoes a change in the Alternate World;
               it becomes the 'Pidgit Bill'. An image of the change is below -
               http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_special2.png

-----------
Banzai Bill
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple2.png
Description:   Bullet Bill, but MUCH bigger. Has a nice evil eyes and grin on
               him, hurts to touch on all sides but the top.
How to defeat: Jump onto the top. But due to its size, I would avoid by going
               onto a higher ledge or ducking in a ditch.

---
Rex
---

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple2.png
Description:   A purple dinosaur (and sorta looks like a dragon). Walks around,
               and is harmful to touch.
How to defeat: Jump upon the once the make him flattened and at half the size,
               and do it again to make him brown bread. Can be defeated with a
               swift spin jump and can be eaten by Yoshi.

----------
Dino-Torch
----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple1.png
Description:   A small green dinosaur that bowls around, and occasionally stops
               and spits fire either horizontally or vertically.
How to defeat: Jump on top of him to defeat. Also can be defeated by cape spin
               and can be eaten by Yoshi. When it opens its mouth, steer clear
               for now and attack or go past when it has stopped spitting fire.

----------
Dino-Rhino
----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple1.png
Description:   A larger version of the Dino-Torch, it is a green dinosaur about
               the size of Super Mario. Walks around, and is slower than the
               Dino-Torch.
How to defeat: Jump onto it once, and he turns into the Dino-Torch. Can be
               defeated straight away with a spin jump, and cape feather spin.
               A Dino-Rhino cannot be eaten by Yoshi; however jumping on him
               while you are on Yoshi will defeat him without reverting to his
               smaller form.

-------------
Volcano Lotus
-------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple4.png
Description:   A plant that rests on the ground. Fires four fireballs every so
               often; two to the left and two to the right which go up and
               drift downwards. Harmful to touch.
How to defeat: Cape spin will defeat it, and can also be eaten by Yoshi.

--------------
Chargin' Chuck
--------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple4.png
Description:   An American football player, usually hangs around near the
               level's exit. Charges towards Mario on sight, even though
               blocks. Has several variations.
How to defeat: Jumping on top makes him squashed for a brief moment, and
               another two bops to the head will take him down. Can be cape
               spun, but not eaten by Yoshi or fireballed. I would tend to
               avoid them whenever possible.
Variations:    They can also throw objects, such as a football and baseballs 
               (wrong sport, guys) which are frankly, annoying to avoid in many
               situations. Sometimes after you jump on or harm a Chuck that
               throws things, he will charge after you.

-----------------------------
Amazing Flyin' Hammer Brother
-----------------------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple4.png
Description:   Sits on flying platforms that swings from side to side, and
               throws hammers below him. Also has a long name.
How to defeat: Hit the flying platform from underneath to knock him off, and
               you can use the platform however you see fit. However the
               hammers injure if you touch them, so stay well away from them.
               You will be seeing a lot of these guys, so get used to defeating
               them.

------------
Sumo Brother
------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple3.png
Description:   Sits on blocks, and stamps onto the blocks to make a lightning
               blot rain down below and cause the ground to set alight for a
               short while.
How to defeat: Hit the block that it is resting on to defeat. You can touch the
               bolts as they come down, so as soon as he is about to stomp down
               a bolt, go and knock him off. The flame range is sorta large, so
               try and avoid it.

-----
Pokey
-----

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple3.png
Description:   A yellow standing caterpillar, which slowly moves. Has small
               spikes on him, and is in segments. Harmful to touch. Collects
               stamps.
How to defeat: If you are Mario, then Pokeys will only have three segments,
               allowing you to jump over him. You can take the segments away
               via throwing blocks or shells, but you may as well just avoid it
               and jump over the Pokey. If you are riding Yoshi, then its five
               segments tall and cannot be jumped over, so you have to eat it
               a segment at a time.
Variations:    If you are just Mario then you will encounter a Pokey with three
               segments, but with Yoshi its five segments.

----------
Monty Mole
----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple3.png
Description:   A small mole that comes from the ground and ledges, burrows up
               and chases Mario.
How to defeat: A good idea is that when you see it borrowing from the ground,
               stand above this point so when it pops up, it hits Mario from
               underneath and dies. Can be jumped on, cape spun, eaten and
               fireballed.

---------
Para-Bomb
---------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A Bob-omb that floats into the level via a parachute. When it
               lands, it loses the parachute and becomes a Bob-omb.
How to defeat: Avoiding it overall is the best option, as they tend to take
               their time floating down and also come in large numbers. It can
               still be eaten in the air. When it lands, it becomes a normal
               Bob-omb (see 'Bob-omb').

-----------
Para-Goomba
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A Goomba that floats into the level via a parachute. When it
               lands, it loses the parachute and becomes a Goomba.
How to defeat: Avoiding it overall is the best option, as they tend to take
               their time floating down and also come in large numbers. It can
               still be eaten in the air. When it lands, it becomes a normal
               Goomba (see 'Goomba').

------
Lakitu
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   This is a guy in a flying cloud, and throws down Spinys onto the
               level.
How to defeat: You could just avoid these guys and the Spinys they throw down,
               or you can stop the Lakitu temporarily. Throwing a block, shell
               or jumping on him from above will defeat him and he will
               reappear later on. In the mean time, you can jump into his cloud
               and fly around for a bit.

--------------
Fishin' Lakitu
--------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A Lakitu (guy in a flying cloud) with a fishing rod. The bait is
               an extra 1-Up green mushroom.
How to defeat: Its sorta up to you how to deal with this one. If you collect
               the 1-Up green mushroom, you get a life, but then he turns into
               a regular Lakitu. Otherwise, you can ignore the bait and carry
               on playing the level.

------
Goomba
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A mushroom round enemy with yellow feet and an angry face.
               Woddles around.
How to defeat: Jumping on him once means he turns upside down and can be picked
               up and thrown about. Throwing him at another enemy will kill
               him. You can also eat him with Yoshi, jump spun and cape spun
               him for instant death.

-------
Bob-omb
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A round black ball with eyes and white feet. Bomb. Walk's around
               and flashes, then explodes. Nice.
How to defeat: This is very much like the Goomba, but with exploding
               tendencies. Jump on him and you can grab him and throw him
               around. When it starts flashing, its gonna blow, so go slow
               motion and dive out of the way when the Bob-omb explodes for
               awesome effect. Otherwise, avoid.

Wiggler
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A yellow cheery caterpillar with a flower on top of its head.
               Just walks around.
How to defeat: The best way to deal with these guys is to either avoid them or
               get Yoshi to eat them. Jumping on them makes 'em mad, go red,
               and start running around chasing Mario, which is not a good
               thing.

-----
Spiny
-----

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple5.png
Description:   A turtle enemy with a spiky shell. Is thrown by the Lakitu.
How to defeat: Avoid. Simple as that, really. Yoshi can eat it though. Also, a
               silver P-Switch makes them turn into silver coins, which when
               you have collected enough, earn you lives.

 6.02. Cave Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are enemies that you will find in the cave areas of the game.

---------
Mega Mole
---------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_staple2.png
Description:   A giant version of the Monty Mole, wears shades and walks around
               and drops off cliffs like a lemming. The foo.
How to defeat: You cannot kill this mean beast believe it or not, but it does
               have its uses. It hurts to touch all sides bar the top, where
               you can sit and ride on merrily. This is helpful in later levels
               in the adventure.

---------
Spike Top
---------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_cave.png
Description:   A turtle like enemy with a single spike on its shell. Bright red
               in colour, and can walk on walls and ceilings.
How to defeat: Avoid this enemy, seeming as you can only defeat it when Yoshi
               eats it. They sometimes walk in groups, so watch out for that
               also.

--------
Swoopers
--------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_cave.png
Description:   Red and green coloured bats that swoop down from the ceilings
               towards Mario (hence the name).
How to defeat: Either avoid (they don't chase you; one swoop and they are not
               used again) or just jump on top of him. Can be fireballed, eaten
               by Yoshi, and cape spun.

------------
Buzzy Beetle
------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_cave.png
Description:   A blueish grey shelled enemy that just walks around.
How to defeat: The Koopa of the caves, jump onto the beetle once to make it
               pop into its shell, where you can do what you will. However, it
               will pop out again after a while, so keep an eye out for that.
               Also a jump spin kills it straight off the bat.

------
Blargg
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_cave.png
Description:   A dinosaur like monster that dwells in lava. You first see its
               eyes peering out of the lava, and a few seconds later it jumps
               out a little.
How to defeat: Jump over it after its eyes appear. Once you get the timing, you
               can jump over more with ease. I don't think it can be defeated;
               but it will not bother you again anyway.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 6.03. Ghost House Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are enemies that you will find in the Ghost Houses; all of which cannot
be defeated.

---
Boo
---

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   Your resident Mario ghost. Round, white, has a face. Look
               towards it and it remains still, and turn away and he chases
               you.
How to defeat: Cannot be defeated; just keep an eye on them and run past when
               you can. I think you can cape spin onto them and bounce off 
               unharmed also.
Variations:    In one ghost house, some Boo's when you face them turn into
               blocks which can be used to jump on.

-----------
Boo Buddies
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   A circle of Boo's that spin round. There is a gap in the circle,
               and they don't chase you either.
How to defeat: Don't touch the circle, and enter it when the gap is present.
               When you have done whatever in the circle, go to the other side
               and exit when the gap comes around.

-------
Big Boo
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   Just like a normal Boo, but much bigger. One of my favourite
               baddies in the game, bless him.
How to defeat: Like the Boo, when you face him he remains still, turn away and
               he gives chase. It's harder to go past him due to his size, so
               lure him in towards you or to a position so you can get past
               him.
Variations:    In one of the ghost houses, he is a boss.

-----------
Fishin' Boo
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   A ghost version of the Lakitu, its a ghost in a flying cloud
               and holds a fishing rod. The bait is a blue flame.
How to defeat: Avoid both the Boo and the flame, due to the fact that they
               hurt. Stay low and watch your jumps.

------
Eeries
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   Ghosts that wonder often in groups across the level. They
               either go straight or bob up and down.
How to defeat: Avoid them by either jumping, ducking, or going to a higher or
               lower platform.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 6.04. Underwater Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are enemies that you will find in the underwater areas of the game. These
are mostly hard to beat and avoid due to that they can swim fine underwater
(makes sense) and Mario is a slow swimmer. Great.

------
Blurps
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_underwater.png
Description:   Your staple fish. Is green and white in colour, often swims
               along with schools of the same kind.
How to defeat: Avoiding is best, but you can eat it with Yoshi, cape spin them
               or fireball if you want.

------------
Rip Van Fish
------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_underwater.png
Description:   Blue and white sleeping fish. They sleep until Mario gets close
               enough, then they wake up and chase. Fast.
How to defeat: Due to that they chase at a speed, I would avoid them the best
               you can. If you are chased, then go like the wind (underwater,
               yes, like the wind) and try and hide somewhere so that he gives
               up and falls back to sleep. Can be cape spun and eaten by Yoshi.

------------
Porcu-Puffer
------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_underwater.png
Description:   A large puffer fish that's blue and white in colour, big eyes,
               large red lips and spikes on his back. Swims at Mario alarmingly
               quickly.
How to defeat: These are annoying, and are found in levels where the water is
               somewhat shallow. Avoid stepping into the water at all times.
               I think you can throw an item its way to defeat it.

------
Urchin
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_underwater.png
Description:   A round purple enemy with a layer of spikes all round. They
               drift around maze like areas and get in the way.
How to defeat: Avoid, if you will. They don't pose much harm (unless you touch
               them) and although they can be defeated (throwing a block their
               way) there isn't much point unless they are doing your nut in.

-----------
Torpedo Ted
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_underwater.png
Description:   The underwater Bullet Bill; these are long block torpedoes with
               evil grins on their faces. They get fired from machines, and
               move quickly.
How to defeat: Only cropping up in one level, they pose a big threat. Avoid
               them if you can, but the torpedo's can be dropped on from above
               to stop them for good, until the next one. Avoid the machines
               that they come from the best you can.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 6.05. Castle and Fortress Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are enemies that you will find in the Castle and Fortress areas of the
game.

---------
Dry Bones
---------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A skeleton of a Koopa, they wonder around and throw bones
               Mario's way.
How to defeat: Jumping on him will make him turn into dust, but will pop back
               up again after a short while. The best way is to spin jump them,
               killing them instantly.

-----------
Bony Beetle
-----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A skeleton of a Buzzy Beetle, they walk around and
               occasionally stop to release spikes from their back.
How to defeat: Wait until the spikes on his back are not out, and jump on him
               to kill him.

------
Thwomp
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A large stone block with a unhappy face on. Falls down when
               Mario gets near, then slowly rises back up again.
How to defeat: Go near the Thwomp so he drops down, then head past as it is
               slowly rising up. Cannot be defeated.

------
Thwimp
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A smaller version of the Thwomp, these jump around from one spot
               to the other on the ground.
How to defeat: Watch where the Thwimp jumps to and from, and go past one point
               when its at the other. Cannot be defeated.

----------
Lil Sparky
----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A small ball of flame that circles a platform at a quick speed.
How to defeat: Cannot be defeated in any way, so you have to dodge it and go
               onward.

-------
Hothead
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle1.png
Description:   A giant version of the Lil Sparky, it circles a platform at a
               slow speed.
How to defeat: Cannot be defeated in any way, so you have to dodge it and go
               onward.

--------
Fishbone
--------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle2.png
Description:   skeleton fish that swim together in schools in the underwater
               areas of castles and fortresses.
How to defeat: Just be out of the way when the school swims by. They can be
               cape spun, but when you spin one you could get hit by another,
               so that's something perhaps not worth doing. So, avoid.

--------------
Ball 'N' Chain
--------------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle2.png
Description:   A grey, spiky ball on a chain that goes round in circles, and is
               harmful to touch in the ball area. (o_0)
How to defeat: When the ball is out of the way, that's your cue to go past. You
               can jump over the ball through the chain if you want however.
               Watch out for nearby Ball 'N' Chain's before jumping.

-------
Grinder
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle2.png
Description:   These are circular saws that travel along the ground. Harmful to
               touch, as you probably could have guessed already.
How to defeat: Just avoid by jumping over when it approaches you.

----------
MechaKoopa
----------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_castle3.png
Description:   Mechanical Koopa's that are green and red in colour. They
               wonder around aimlessly.
How to defeat: Jumping on its head will flatten it, and like the Bob-omb and 
               the Goomba, you can use it to throw at other enemies. After
               a while it will turn back and become normal again, so watch out
               for this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 6.06. Bosses
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These are the games bosses that you will come across during the course of the
game.

------
Reznor
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_reznor.png
Description:   The boss of all the fortress' across Dinosaur Land.
How to defeat: You are faced against four dinosaurs on rotating platforms, of 
               which spit fireballs your way. To kill them, hit the platform
               from underneath. When you have hit all four off the platforms,
               the boss is over. But (a big but) is the ground is slowly
               disappearing, so you must be hasty in doing this. Hit one off as
               you start, and when the ground is no long under where you can
               hit the dinos from below, you may have to jump onto one of the
               rotating platforms. The fireballs are easy enough to dodge, as 
               if you do this fast enough it isn't that tough. A good idea is
               to knock one off, jump on his platform and take out the others
               as it rotates round.

-------
Big Boo
-------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_ghosthouse.png
Description:   The boss of the Donut Secret House's Secret Exit.
How to defeat: To harm him, grab a block from below you and throw it at him
               (its easier to be underneath him and throw it upwards). Once you
               have hit him, he will turn transparent. Keep looking towards
               the Boo's so they don't attack you, and get yourself underneath
               Big Boo so when he reappears you can attack again. After a total
               of three hits, you win the battle.

----
Iggy
----

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_boss.png
Description:   The boss of the first castle.
How to defeat: This battle takes place on a platform that tilts left and right,
               and you have to hit Iggy into the lava either side of the area.
               He will attack by throwing fireballs, of which are easy to
               avoid. Jumping on Iggy will make him move down the side its
               tilting. So, when it is tilting one side, jump on him once or
               twice to make him go to one end, leave him when it tilts to the
               other side, and then hit him off when it reverts back to the
               first side again.

------
Morton
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_boss.png
Description:   The boss of the second castle.
How to defeat: To hurt Morton, simply jump on his head. He will walk left, up
               the wall and drop from the ceiling where ever you are standing.
               When he lands you are immobilised for a second. So the tactic is
               when he is about to come over you and fall, jump out of the way
               and then jump on him. He will speed up when he gets hit, and
               after three bops to the noggin he's done for. Easy, no? You can
               also use fireballs to hurt Morton if you are Fire Mario also.

-----
Lemmy
-----

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_boss.png
Description:   The boss of the third castle.
How to defeat: Here, you are in an area with pipes. Every few seconds, three
               things pop out of the pipes at the same time; the boss, and two
               fakes. Hitting the boss means you hurt him, and hitting a fake
               means they pop back in and do it again at different points.
               Hitting the boss three times means he will fall through the
               bottom into the lava below, and you win. The only thing that you
               should look out for is a fireball that bounces around the area;
               just keep an eye on it as you look out for the boss. This
               shouldn't be too difficult.

------
Lugwig
------

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_boss.png
Description:   The boss of the forth castle.
How to defeat: This boss is not a problem to take down. He will start firing
               fireballs at you; these are easy to avoid, so dodge them then 
               jump on him. He will now go into his shell and chase you, jump
               over him as he comes your way and keep doing that until he
               stops, where he will do this weird summersault, then land, and
               repeat the process (he will start firing fireballs again). Jump
               on him three times to finish him off. You can also use fireballs
               to hurt Lugwig if you are Fire Mario.

---
Roy
---

Image:         http://www.geocities.com/crazyreyn/smw_boss.png
Description:   The boss of the fifth castle.
How to defeat: This is the same as the boss battle with Morton, except that the
               walls slowly are closing in on the area. To hurt Roy, simply
               jump on his head. He will walk left, up the wall and drop from
               the ceiling wherever you are standing. When he lands you are
               immobilised for a second. So the tactic is when he is about to
