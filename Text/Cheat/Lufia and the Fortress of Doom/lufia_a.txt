========
WELCOME
========
Welcome to my guide for Lufia! I've played this game through quite a few
times and have really enjoyed it, so I thought I'd write a guide for it!
There are a couple of other Lufia guides available on the Net, but I plan
to make this guide the best Lufia guide out there! I hope you enjoy it as
much as I enjoyed writing it! Lufia is a SNES RPG made by Taito in 1993.
It has only been available where I live (Australia) for a couple of years
though. If you don't have this game, go out and get the emulated version
somewhere because this game should not be missed. The sequel Lufia 2 is
really great also, it's actually a prequel to the first Lufia. This is my
first attempt at writing a guide. Hopefully it will meet all of your
expectations out there. If you want to know how long it takes to finish,
it will end up taking the average player about 30 hours to finish. Okay
now on to the guide! Have fun!

LEVEL GUIDE
============
To go alongside of this guide, I will be creating another document which
will show each point in the game, and what your characters statistics should
be. This is very handy, mainly because if you are having trouble with the
enemies or bosses at a certain section of the game, you can check your
statistics against the ones laid out in my document. If your statistics are
lower, you should consider powering up your statistics to be close to the
ones in my level guide, which will make things a hell of a lot easier for you.
If you have this guide, but don't know where to find the Level Guide and are
looking for it, head on over to GAMEFAQS (www.gamefaqs.com) and you are sure
to find it there in addition to a lot of other great guides!


================
BRIEF STORYLINE
================
Below is the introduction to the game, which you see when you start a new game.

"Without warning, the island suddenly appeared in the sky. Four foul and wicked
beings claimed it for themselves. They possessed the frightening powers of
Chaos, Destruction, Terror, and Death. The people were horrified. They called
the evil ones "Sinistrals". The reign of Terror continued. The world masses
its warriors to battle their dark foes. But the Sinistrals were all powerful.
In desperation, the people called on their bravest fighters: Artea, Guy, Maxim,
and Selan. And so began the final battle..."


====================
THE MAIN CHARACTERS
====================

Hero (female) - You are a young Alekian knight, who has the blood of Maxim
running through your veins. You will become the greatest knight ever, perhaps
even surpassing the great Maxim yourself.

CAN HE USE MAGIC?: YES, he can use Healing Magic and Defensive Magic.

Lufia (female) - Lufia seemed to come out of nowhere nine years ago to Alekia, and
she immediately became friend with the Hero. Today, Lufia has an intense love for
the Hero and doesn't want to be parted from him.

CAN SHE USE MAGIC?: YES, she can use Offensive, Defensive and Healing
                    Magic.

ATP   DFP   STR   INT   AGL   MGR
---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---

==============
IN-GAME MENUS
==============
The in-game menus can be accessed by pressing the B Button. It is an important
aspect of the game, as it allows you to use items, equip new weapons and armour,
lets you view the statistics of your characters, lets you view each character's
magic skills, and lets you customize the game settings.

ITEMS - Lets you use your items
EQUIP - Lets you change your weapons and armour
MAGIC - Lets you view and use magic
MENU - Lets you alter game settings


ITEMS
------
>From within this menu, you can some of your items by moving the hand icon to the
item you want to use, and pressing the A Button once to select that item, moving
the hand icon to the character you want to use it on (depending on the item),
and then pressing A again to use it on that character.

EQUIP
------
When you click into this menu you will then have to select whose character's
equipment you want to view or change. Select the character by pressing A. You can
view each of your characters statistics (i.e. Attack Power (ATP), Defensive Power
(DFP), Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Agility (AGL) and Magic Resistance
(MGR). If you want to alter the character's equipment, move the hand icon to the
piece of equipment you want to change. Once selected, you must choose whether you
want to change the current equipment (EQUIP) or simply remove that equipment
(LIFT). If you select EQUIP, you will be shown a menu of the other pieces of
equipment that the character can also equip. Note that items in green cannot be
equipped by that character. Before you choose the new equipment, you can leave
the icon next to the new equipment to check against the statistics of that
character to see how he/she will change if you equip that character with the
new weapon/armour. The green number next to the equipment shows how many of
that equipment you own.

MAGIC
------
Once in this menu, you must select whose character's magic you want to use
or view. Once you have chosen a character, you will see that character's
magic listed. If you want to check what a certain spell does, move the
hand cursor next to the spell, then press X to see a description. Or if you
want to use a spell, move the hand cursor to that spell, then press A,
then select the character that you want to use it on. Spells that in the
colour gold cannot be used now. Just under each spell is two numbers. The
first number shows how many magic points (MP) this spell will use, and the
number in the brackets shows how many times you can use it, depending on
the amount of MP your character has.

MENU
-----
SCENARIO - This menu lists the important items you own (e.g. important
 keys, etc.)
COMBAT ORDER - This lets you change the order in which your characters will
 be placed in when in battle.
ITEM SORT - This lets you manually alter the positions of all of your items.
 An automatic sorter will have been helpful here :)
MAGIC SORT - ???
MESSAGE - This lets you toggle between different text speeds (SLOW, NORMAL,
 FAST)
MUSIC - This lets you toggle between STEREO and MONO sound
PLAYING TIME - This shows you how many hours and minutes you have been
 playing through this game

================
THE WALKTHROUGH
================
Throughout the entire guide, I will be revealing as little of the storyline
as possible so that you can get maximum enjoyment out of playing this game.
In addition to the essential quests during the game, I will also walk you
through the optional stuff which benefits your party. In buying weapons and
armour, I will display the cost price of that weapon/armour and by how much
it will benefit your party. Also, remember that as soon as you buy a weapon
or armour, make sure you equip it, so you can use it. Also when you equip
new stuff, make sure you sell your old stuff that you don't want anymore,
which will not only lighten your inventory, but also bring in more money.
One last thing: you will notice that the walkthrough is currently not
finished. This is because in addition to forwarding the release date of the
guide, it also gives me the opportunity to receive feedback from you so I
know what you think of the guide, which will give me ideas on how to improve
the guide for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this section of the game, do not open ANY treasure chests, because you
will be coming back to this place later on in the game and you will need
the items then much more. There are two signs in this first room. You can
read them if you want. They just talk about pressing the X button in the
menu against a spell to see what it does. It really doesn't matter if you
read it or not. Head up the path in the middle of the room. It leads to a
set of stairs going up. Go up these stairs which leads you to the next
floor. From here, go up the path and through the door. This next room is
very long and has a reflective floor. Go through this room and through the
door at the other end. Go down the path and go up the stairs. This next
room also has a reflective floor. Go up the FIRST set of stairs, not the
SECOND set yet, and go left and up the path until you reach a set of
stairs going down. Go down these stairs and go down and to the right until
you see a flashing blue pod. Step on this pod and everyone in your party
will have fully restored MP. Now go to the left of the room and up and
step on the blue flashing pod there and your party's HP will be restored.
Now exit the room the same way you entered. Continue down the path you
here and go up the SECOND set of stairs now and walk up along the blue
carpet. You will pass some pillars and four statues and come to a set of
stairs going up. Go up these stairs and up through the door that you come
to. You will come to a room with a path to the left and to the right and
a path going up which has a few glass steps next to two round structures.
Now start to go up the glass path and Daos will speak to you.
The characters try not to show fear and cross the path. Now step on the
flashing blue portal. In this next room, the first thing you should do is
heal all of your characters HP and MP. Just go into the menu and give a
Miracle to anybody who doesn't already have full HP and MP. Don't worry
you won't run out of Miracles! :) Now step up the steps ahead of you and
you will be challenged by each of the Sinistrals.

=========================================================================
                              BOSS: Gades
=========================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Thunder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This guy is extremely easy. It would be very difficult to die from him I
would imagine. The easiest and quickest way to beat this guy is simply
to have Selan using her Thunder magic against Gades, and for everybody
else to use physical attacks. It couldn't be simpler. If for some reason
you become low on HP, just use a Miracle on yourself and you'll be back
in business.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this easy fight, before you take even one more step, use Miracles
on anybody who doesn't have full HP and MP. Believe me, it is easier to
start a fight against another boss will full HP and MP than it is with
half energy. Now just step up to the next boss.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
                              BOSS: Amon
=========================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Thunder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This guy is a bit tougher than Gades, but he is still very easy. You will
probably not need to heal yourself during this fight again, but if your
HP goes below, say 200, then use a Miracle on yourself. The quickest
strategy is just to get Selan using her Thunder magic, and to get
everybody else simply to use their physical attacks. I severely doubt
that you will die from this fight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this fight, just heal everybody in your party again using Miracles
who hasn't already got full HP and MP. I doubt that anybody will have
full HP and MP at this stage though. Just step up to the next boss.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
                              BOSS: Erim
=========================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Nothing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again this boss is extremely easy. This chick deals more damage than
the other bosses so far, but it's nothing to get stressed about. If your
HP get below 300 then just heal using a Miracle. I suggest just using
physical attacks from all your characters against her, because she is
very strong against magic. However, if you do use magic against her, make
sure you stop when she casts Mirror, because if you keep using magic, her
Mirror will reflect that spell back on to you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the last time, before facing the next boss, heal all of your members
using a Miracle before facing the next boss. You've nearly defeated all
the Sinistrals! Now just step up to the last boss for the final fight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================================================================
                             BOSS: Daos
=========================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Thunder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daos is the toughest of the bunch, but he's still a walk in the park. But
I am almost certain that you will need to heal yourself during the course
of this fight. If anybody's HP gets below 350, get Maxim to cast Valor,
and you'll be set. Now, otherwise get Selan to cast Thunder, and everyone
else to use physical attacks, and Daos will be defeated in no time at
all! Easy stuff!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will now watch a lengthy cut-scene showing what happened after you
defeated the Sinistrals. After this, it will tell you that this actually
happened 90 years ago, and since then there were no troubles in the
world, until now ... The next scene shows the hero walk into the store
and talk with Roman (owner of the store) and then a young girl walks in
and calls herself Lufia. She then plays with the Hero, and now we go
another nine years in the future ...

ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: None
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will have a long talk with Lufia out in the flower garden and then
she agrees to make you some cinnamon pie and you walk back to the Inn so
she can cook it. You will overhear some knights talking about monsters
are starting to attack Sheran. You will run off when you hear this. When
you get control of your character again, go back to the inn and talk to
everyone in here, and then go up the stairs. In the room with one bed in
it, examine the cabinet here and you will get a Dress. Other stuff to do
in this town is to go to the weapons store and buy a Dagger (50G, +6 ATP).
Go to the Item shop next to the weapons store and buy 2 Potions (8G x 2),
2 Antidotes (6G x 2), 2 Sweet Waters (10G x 2) and an Arrow (2G). Now go
to the left to the Church and save your game. Next, go two houses to the
left of the church and examine the cabinet for a Revive item. Now go
down the stairs in the house. Follow the path and you'll see it leads to
the church. Open the treasure chest here for a Sweet Water item. Next,
go to the training room that you saw during the cut-scene which is in
the top left part of the town. Examine the cabinet in here for a Cloth
Helm (+2 DFP). Make sure you equip it. Now exit this house and walk
around to the other side of the house and examine the flower patch here
for a Power Potion. Use the Power Potion on yourself. After talking to
everybody here in the town, proceed up to the northern part of the town
and go into the Castle.

                            ALEKIA CASTLE
=========================================================================
ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: None
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talk to everyone here on the first floor of the castle. There are quite a
few items on this floor of the castle. Go to the top left room here with
the knight sitting down. After talking to him, open the treasure chest to
get an Arrow. Examine the right-most cabinet in the room to receive a
Revive item. Now go to the next room to the right with the woman in a
blue dress. Examine the second cabinet from the left to get a Swing Wing,
and examine the cabinet on the right to get an Escape. Now go up the
stairs to the next floor. There's not much to do on the second floor,
except talk to the couple of people here, and go to the top right room
with the 3 cabinets next to each other. Examine the middle one for a
Potion. Go to the room to the left of it and examine the dresser for
another Potion. No go up the stairs to the next floor. When you get to
this floor speak to the Princess (the closest person to you) and she
will give you 100G. Now go into the Princess' room at the top left of
this floor and examine the dresser at the left for a Stuffed Bear.
Now examine the right-hand cabinet for a Bracelet. Don't sell the
Bracelet because you will need to equip it later on. Now talk to the
King in the Throne room. After that, go to the top right hand side of
this floor and go down the stairs. Keep doing down the stairs until
you reach a room with 3 treasure chest. Open them and you will get a
Revive, an Antidote and a Sweet Water. Now go back up all the flights
of stairs again. Once you reach the top floor again, go back down
the stairs that you entered first to get to this floor. Keep going
down the stairs and out of the castle. Now leave Alekia. Soon you
should head to Chatam before going to Sheran.

ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: Madshroom, Big Newt, Jellyfish
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
At the start of walking around on the world map, you will find yourself
constantly having to restore your HP. But don't waste Potions on it.
Just keep powering up on all the enemies in this area until you reach
Level 3. But make sure you fight the enemies that are close to Alekia
because you will need to go to the shrine to the left of Alekia a few
times so don't go to far away. When you become low on HP, walk to the
small shrine area to the left of Alekia. In this shrine area, make your
way to an old man. After telling you what you should do next, he will
instantly restores all of your HP and MP. Keep coming to this old man
when you come to have low HP, because it saves using your precious
Items. But you will probably have to use the occasional Potion during
a fight because if you don't you will probably die. But just make sure
you keep a couple. When you feel you are readily powered up enough,
walk up the map, and you will soon see a small hut to the left. Enter
the town of Chatam.

ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: None
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
When you first enter Chatam, examine the first flower patch just under
you, and one of the flowers will give you a Great Potion. Use this
Potion on yourself. This is an Item store here that sells Potions,
Antidotes and Arrows. Buy some of these if you need them. If you have
any unwanted items here you should sell them. If you don't have enough
money to buy all the items you may want, then just return to the world
map and keep killing more enemies until you have enough money. In the
house in the top right corner of the town, if you examine the bookcase
you will get a Smoke Ball. Also if you want to, you can rest at the
inn. Now leave Chatam and head up the world map.

You should power up to at least Level 5 by the time you reach Sheran. Go up
the map past the cave entrance to your left, and you will come to a 2nd cave
entrance. Enter here. Follow the path and enter the door that you come to.

Inside this room open the 2 treasure chests to get a Potion and 200G. Now
exit the cave and go down the map and enter the cave entrance that you saw
first. Inside this cave take the right path and keep following it until you
can go no further. Examine the rough patch at the end of the path to get a
Revive. Go back to the start of the cave and follow the left path out of the
cave and enter the castle when you get back on to the world map.

You will see that monsters have basically destroyed the whole village of
Sheran. Just talk to everyone and enter the castle at the north end of town.
When you enter the castle, go into the room just up a bit and to the left.
Open the four treasure chests to receive four Potions. Now enter the room to
the right. Open the four treasure chests to receive an Antidote, Foul Water,
Sweet Water and Awaken. Now go up the stairs near the start of the room. On
this floor enter the room to the left. Examine the bookcase at the left for
Sweet Water, and the one in the middle for Foul Water. Enter the room to the
right. Open the chests to receive 2 Arrows and a Mid Arrow. The dresser
contains a Revive. There is nothing left to do in Sheran Castle, so if you
want to you can go back down all the stairs and leave Sheran and head out
towards Alekia again. Otherwise you can go up the stairs and see some
treasure chests in the throne room that you can't get to yet, because the
doors are locked. So if you looked at the chests you can't open, go back
down all the stairs and head for Alekia.

Once in Alekia head to the inn, and speak to Roman. After taking a break, go
up the stairs and talk to Lufia. Now go up to the part of town and into
Alekia Castle. In the top left room, speak to the Commander. He agrees to
organize a meeting about sending troops to Sheran next week! This really
annoys the Hero. Now go up the stairs to the next floor. There is nothing to
do on this floor so go up the stairs again to the next floor. On this floor,
speak to the Princess and she will ask her father to gather up troops right
away. Now leave the town of Alekia. As soon as you arrive on the world map,
Lufia comes out and stops you. She will talk herself into coming along with
you on your quest to Sheran. After Lufia joins your party equip her with the
Bracelet. If you already sold it don't worry, but she's better with it.
Return to Alekia and go the Armour store. Buy a Cloth (140G, +8 DFP) and
equip Lufia with it. Go to the weapons store and buy a Dagger (50G, +6 ATP)
and equip it to Lufia. Now go to the church and save your game. There's
nothing much else to do here in Alekia, except that some of the people in
the town and the castle will tell you something different now that you are
back with Lufia. Head out back to Sheran ....

On your way to Sheran, you can stop in at Chatam and speak to everyone here
and they will tell you that Lilah has gone into the Northwest cave. When you
go in the cave on your way to Sheran, you will see a man lying face down
along the left path. Speak to him and he will tell you that his sister Lilah
has gone to Sheran Castle. He also gives you the key to Sheran Castle so
that you can save her from the monsters. Continue going to Sheran. Once you
arrive at Sheran, go straight ahead to Sheran Castle. Head up and the stairs
and into the Throne Room. Unlock the doors to the left and right in this
room. In the room to the left, examine the switch at the top of the room and
the switch will lower. In the room at the right, open up the treasure chest
and you will receive 100 gold pieces. Now exit the throne room. Go around to
the left or to the right and enter the room that you come to. Go down the
two sets of stairs in the rooms that you come to. Now you will be in a room
that merges with the other path that you could have taken. In the middle of
this room is a set of stairs going down. Go down the stairs. You will then
come to another room with a set of stairs going down to the right. Go down
these stairs as well. You will come to a room with two cells. Walk up to
the cell on the left and you will find the people you were looking for. Go
into this cell room and examine the bookcase at the top of the room and
you will receive a Great Potion. Give the Great Potion to Lufia which will
increase her Strength. Now leave the cell room and go up the stairs the
way you came. Now keep going up the stairs that you just came down, and
eventually make your way out of Sheran Castle. As you leave Sheran Castle,
you will be confronted by none other than Gades the Evil Sinistral!

This is a one on one battle between the Hero and Gades. Don't worry you
can't win, because this guy does you like 500 damage per hit. It really
doesn't matter what you do, but don't waste items on him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Gades defeats you, Lufia will run on screen. After her talk with you,
you will be in Alekia again. Roman will take you into the inn for a talk
with you both. He asks what the hero plans to do now, and after finding out
he wants to speak with Lufia alone. He then tells Lufia that he thinks she
should go with the hero whenever he may go. She decides to go with him.
Immediately go back with Lufia to the inn and speak to Roman. He will let
you rest for free. Now head up back into Alekia Castle. Talk to everybody
in the castle. Go up to the second floor and go to the back rooms. Speak to
Lilah and she will go with you back to Chatam. Go up to the next floor and
speak to the Princess. She will talk to you about Gades. You can also speak
to the King for some praise :) There's nothing else for you to do here in
Alekia Castle, so make your way back out. There's nothing else to do in
Alekia either, so proceed to Chatam ...

As you try and cross the stream to get the right side of the town, Lilah
will see Danil her brother, and they will be reunited. They tell you about a
town called Treck which is to the southwest of Sheran. Finally the thank you
for all the help you've given them. There's nothing else to do but head for
Treck.

>From the moment you leave Chatam, you should start powering your characters
as much as you can. By the time I entered Treck, my main character was at
Level 8 and Lufia was at Level 7. Powering up to this level does take a fair
while however. The best place to power up is in the area around Treck. If
you can't find Treck, after Sheran head left and keep going and you will see
a whole hilly section of map. Go down and to the left from here and you will
probably walk over a desert-like place. Keep going down and left and you
will see a small port town right at the bottom. To power up quickly use Foul
Water. Once your characters are powered up enough, enter Treck.

Once in Treck, enter the house just to the left of the entrance. In here,
examine the bookshelf to receive a Hair Band(+2 DFP). Equip it to Lufia. Now
go upstairs and open the chest for a Dress. Go and rest at the Inn. Now go
to the weapon shop and buy a Club (120G, +9 ATP) and a Long Knife(180G,
+5 ATP). Equip the Club to the Hero and the Long Knife to Lufia. Now go next
door to the armour store, buy the Cloth Armour(240G, +4 DFP) and a Robe
(260G, +3 DFP). Equip the Cloth Armour to the Hero and the Robe to Lufia.
Examine the left bookshelf in between the weapon and armour shops for a
Power Gourd. Now enter the cave at the lower left hand side of Treck. Follow
the left path and open the two chests for a Smoke Ball and Arrows. Now go up
the forward path you will a stack of crates. Walk towards the bottom crate
on the second row of crates from the left. It is still more forward than the
crates to the left and right of it. Try to walk in between these two crates
and you see you can't. Examine and you will get a Swing Wing. Now try and
go left and you won't be able to. Examine and you will get an Escape. Talk
to the old man in here and buy one of each of the ciders. If you don't have
enough money go back out onto the world map and earn money by killing
enemies. Leave the cave and go back to the top left part of Treck and enter
the pub. Buy a Pear Cider from the man selling cider. Go to item store and
buy a few Antidotes, a couple of Arrows and about two Shrieks. If you have
any more money left I recommend spending it all on Potions. If you rather
saving your money you can, but when I play games, I usually like to have
as many Potions as possible. Save your game at the Church. Go down to the
port part of Treck and you will see an old man standing still at the bottom.
After speaking to him, you be asked to come to the East Cave. So leave Treck
and head east and enter the cave that you come to.

his cave is very straightforward. The chest in the lower-right hand corner
of the first room contains Cloth Shoes(+4 DFP). Equip these to the Hero. Go
down the stairs. In this room, walk to the locked red door at the end and
Ainea (the second girl) will unlock it for you. Go through the now open
door. In this room, open the treasure chest to receive a Swing Wing. Finally
exit at the top of the room. When you come out to the world map, enter the
house right next to you.

When you enter this area, walk ahead and enter the house that you come to.
It turns out that this is Guy's house. He is over 100 years old now and
certainly looks it. After you talk to him about Gades, he feels that he must
also do something about it, and dies of a heart attack. But he says that you
should head for Grenoble to meet someone who knows Artea, who can help you.
When you get control of your character, walk back over to where you buried
Guy and examine the sword sticking out of the ground and you will receive a
Short Sword. Equip it to the Hero. Now talk to Ainea again and she will tell
you where to find Grenoble. Now leave this area and head back to Treck.

The first thing you should do in Treck is stay at the Inn and save your game
at the Church. Now walk down to the ports and you will see a ship and two
men standing next to it. Talk to them and you will meet Aguro, commander of
the army at Lorbenia. Suddenly a ship comes and a bunch of Demon Lords
attack you!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


============================================================================
                           BOSS: Demon Lords
============================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Nothing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are four of these guys to contend with. These guys are generally
pretty easy, but they can be annoying when they want to be. The addition of
Aguro into your party is a big help for this fight. The Demon Lord attack
very frequently and mostly use Magic Mirror to reflect your magic attacks,
so I suggest just getting everyone to use physical attacks. You will

robably end up healing your characters a lot, and should get the Hero or
Lufia to cast Strong on one of your characters when their HP hits, say,
below 40. Aguro is particularly weak against their attacks, so make sure his
HP stays right up. It doesn't take long to kill them, and it's not too tough
so you should win without many problems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After beating them, go to the armour store and buy a Cloth Helm(120G,
+2 DFP) and equip it on Aguro. You may want to rest at the Inn, save at the
Church and stock up on items. When you're ready to leave, exit Treck and
head north to a cave. Enter it.

If you look to your right you will see a ladder. Climb this ladder and
follow the path. You will come to a treasure chest. Open it and receive a
Potion. Keep following the path and you will come to a set of stairs going
down, next to a large hole. Don't fall down the large hole, but go down the
stairs. Follow the path and open the two treasure chests that you come to.
You will get a Potion and a Power Potion. Give the Power Potion to Lufia and
head up the stairs you just came down. Now drop down the large hole to your
right. You will see two animated blue pods. Step on the upper one and you be
transported to a new area. Follow the path, go down the ladder and through
the door. This room contains two blue pods. Step on both of them to refill
your HP and MP. Now go back to the room with the two blue animated pods.
Step on the bottom pod this time and you will be transported back to the
starting room. Go to the right and up (under the bridge) and you will see
a set of stairs going down. Go down the stairs. In this room, you will see
a pool of green guck just below you. Get the Hero to cast Float and examine
the pool area. Somewhere in the pool is an invisible chest which contains a
Miracle. You have to cast Float over the green pool because if you dont,
each character will lose 1 HP per step that you take in the pool. Now keep
going down the path a bit, and you will an open door above you. Go in this
room and open the chest in here for a Daze Ring. Equip it to Lufia. Leave
this room and follow the path to left. Go up the ladder and up the stairs.
You will now be on the other side of the large hole you were at before.
Follow the path to the left and go up the stairs to leave the cave. As soon
as you get back to the world map, restores your whole party's HP and MP.
Walk towards the ship and Lufia will notice that you are about to be
attacked!

WEAK AGAINST: Arrows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These three Goblins are extremely easy. Just keep using physical attack and
you can also use Arrows and Mid Arrows if you want, because the Goblins are
very weak against them. You probably won't have to heal yourself, but if you
do just use Strong, and you should beat them in no time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You now have access to the Maberia ship! You realise it is a good idea to go
back to Treck, and you will automatically shipped there.

Once here, Aguro will go to the Army Headquarters and agrees to meet you at
the Inn later. Lufia wants to shop for dresses (surprise, surprise!). Head
down to the shops here. You will see a weapon/armour store sign amongst the
shops. Walk one row behind it and examine for a Mind Potion. Give it to the
Hero. Now enter the weapon shop just to the left, and examine the bookshelf
for a Mid Arrow. Now enter the shops here and stock up on items at the two
stores to the left and right here. Go up the stairs at the north part of
this floor. This next floor is pretty large. There is a woman selling
accessories in a stall here. It's not worth buying any accessories, because
they all suck. There is also a man selling stuffed animals here. You don't
have to buy any of them, but I usually buy all of them when I'm here. At
the bottom right corner of this floor is a treasure chest containing a
Sweet Water. Now go up the stairs at the bottom left corner of this floor.
When you go into the clothing shop, Lufia gets all excited and starts
looking at dresses. Talk to everyone here. One of the salespeople tells
Lufia that there is a sale at the moment. Lufia get excited again and runs
to look at the dresses. A young boy then steals some gold from Lufia and
runs from the store. The Hero catches him and Lufia comes out as well, but
lets the boy keep the gold if he promises not to steal again. Now go to the
right, and into the Inn. Talk to the Inn keeper here and he will tell you
about Lou, the kid who stole from you. You can also rest here if you want
to. Next, go to the armour shop to the left of the store where Lou stole
from you. Buy two Tan Armours(480G x 2, +16 DFP), two Tan Helms(240G x 2,
+5 DFP), Cloth Shoes(300G, +4 DFP), a Glass Cap(460G, +4 DFP) and a Tan
Shield (180G, +5 DFP). Equip a Tan Armour, Tan Shield and a Tan Helm to the
Hero. Equip the other Tan Armour and the other Tan Helm to Aguro. Equip the
Glass Cap and the Cloth Shoes to Lufia. Now go to the weapon store and buy
a Staff(360G, +37 ATP). Equip it to Lufia. To buy all of this, you will
probably have to go out to the World Map, and fight enemies to get the
required money. This will also give you important experience which you will
be thankful for in later areas. Now leave Lorbenia and head down the world
map and to the left and enter the town that you come to, Grenoble.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you get to Grenoble, you may rest at the Inn for 40G if you want to.
You should probably also save your game at the Church. Now, go to the
weapons shop and examine the left shelf to receive a Potion. There's no use
buying any of the weapons here because they are no better than what you
already have equipped. It's the same with the armour shop here so don't buy
any armour either. Go to the Item shop and buy some Potions and Antidotes
if required. I also recommend buying some Awakens, some Stone Cures and some
Smoke Balls, but you don't have to if you don't have the cash. As long as
you keep at least 50G on you. Talk to everyone in town and they will
tell you about the Old Cave near Grenoble that has many treasures within it.
I find the Old Cave one of my favourite parts of the game. It's really fun.
Now go to the house to the left of the Item Shop at the top left part of
town. Talk to the people here and a man will let you pass for 50G. Give him
the money and go down the stairs. Before you do anything else, head back up
the stairs that you came down and immediately look up and examine the shelf
for a Speed Potion. You had to go down the stairs first because that is the
only way that you can access the shelf. Give the Speed Potion to Aguro to
increase his agility. Now go back down the stairs and follow the path. Go up
the stairs at the end of this path and examine the flower patch just above
you for a Spell Potion. Give it to the Hero to gain some more MP. Now go to
the right and you will see a man standing next to a set of stairs going
down. Do not walk past him and down the path as you'll just have to repeat
the last few steps to get here. Instead go down the stairs next to the man.
This is the room where you will get tasks assigned to you in the Old Cave.
Talk the old man at the lower right part of the room. He appears to know
something about Artea, but wants you to retrieve the Fairy Kiss item on the
second level of the Old Cave before telling you more. Talk to the man behind
the counter to get a task assigned to you. More than likely it will be the
2nd level task of finding the Secret Map for 500G. Choose to accept this
task. Now exit this place and exit Grenbole and head to the left on the
world map to the large cave that you will see.

ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: Mini Demon, Giant Bat, Rat, Bore Worm, Kobold,
 Roozard, Giant Newt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speak to the man here on the first level. He tells you to enter the elevator
above and flip the switch there to get to the second level. Do as he says
and you will end up at the second level. Many of the treasure chests here
are empty. It will be too confusing if I tell you exactly which treasure
chest contains what because there are just so many of them, so instead open
all of the treasure chests on the way and check against the list that I have
at the end of this part of all the items that are found in the treasure
chests on this level so you know if you have them all. They will roughly be
in the same order that you will probably find them in. Anyway, back to the
guide. You will have a choice of two paths: one to the right or one going
down. Go along the right path first. You will have another choice of
choosing a path going up or a path going down. Go along the path going up
first. Now you will see a sign just to the left of an open door. Read the
sign which says that only women can enter this room. Attempt to go into this
door and Lufia says she will get the item alone. Now go through the open
door. I suggest restoring Lufia's HP because she will be on her own for a
little while. Follow this path and you see a room with heaps of treasure
chests in it. Open them all and one of them contains the Fairy Kiss. And one
of them contains Heeled Shoes (+5 ATP, +2 DFP). Equip these to Lufia. Once
you have done this exit this room and walk towards your party to rejoin
them. Now follow the path all the way down. You will see two treasure chests
here. Get the Hero to cast Float and open the two treasure chests here for
more important items. Next, go back up the path and then to the left. Now go
along the path heading down. There are two pools of muck here. Next to the
bottom pool, get the Hero to cast Float again. Examine around in this pool
and you will find an Ex Potion around the middle of this pool. Very handy.
Keep going along this path and enter the open door that you come to. In this
room open the two chests for a Power Ring and the Secret Map. Equip the
Power Ring (+10 ATP) to the Hero. The items found in treasure chests here
are a Hi Magic, a Potion, an Antidote, a Float, Cloth Shoes, a Dress, a Hair
Band, Heeled Shoes, an Earring, a Fairy Kiss, a Tan Shield, a Dragon Egg, a
Potion, a Sleep Arrow, a Power Ring and a Secret Map. You now have all the
items that you need here so head back to the elevator and exit the Old Cave.
Wasn't that fun? Now head back to Grenoble.

You probably should rest at the Inn and save your game at the Church. Now
go back to the man who wants you to pay him 50G to get past and pay him to
get past again. Follow the path and head back to room where they assign you
tasks. Speak to the old man. He will take the Fairy Kiss and tell you that
Artea's apprentice can be found in a northwest tower from Grenoble. But
first, talk to the woman behind the counter here and she will take the 
secret map and give you 500G. You can also talk to the man behind the
counter who will assign to you the 3rd Level Task. You should not accept
this task yet, because the enemies on the 3rd Level are still a bit too
difficult for the level of your party yet. But we will go there a little bit
later on. Now leave this place and exit Grenoble. Once on the world map,
head to left a fair distance, and then head up. Keep going up until you see
a large tower near the coastline. Enter it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


============================================================================
                            THE NORTHWEST TOWER
============================================================================
ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: Zombie, Mini Crab, Mini Demon, Fight, Goblin, Rat,
 Huge Bunny, Roozard, Giant Newt, Red Magi, BOSS-Apprentice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I won't beat around the bush here. This tower is pretty damn hard. But if
you keep your HP up throughout the tower you should be able to do it
without too many troubles. In comparison, the 3rd Level of the Old Cave is
a little bit more difficult than this tower. I suggest powering up your
characters in this tower to start with. Follow the path to the right and
enter the door that you come to. In this room follow the right path and
enter the door that you come to. You will be in a room now with 2 treasure
chests. Open them to receive a Hi Potion and a Hi Magic. Now exit this room
and go up the stairs to the left. Once there, go down a bit and open the
treasure chest for a Smoke Ball. Now go to the lower left part of this room
and go up the stairs that you come to. In this room you will see two
lowered bits in this bottom wall just to your right. They are actually doors
that you go through. Go through the door closest to you. In here there are
two treasure chests containing a Power Gourd and a Mind Gourd. Exit this
room and enter the door just to the right. This room contains a treasure
chest containing a Hi Potion. Exit this room and go to the right and up
through the open door. There is a treasure chest in this room containing a
Revive. Finding the tower difficult yet? If not, then you're doing well.
Exit this room and go to the left and up the stairs that you came down
before. Now go straight up the path and through the open door. In here, just
go through the door at the bottom right (duh!). In this room, you will see
an open door to the far right and a set of stairs going down. Go through the
open door at the far right. In this room go right and down the path to the
very bottom. To the right of you is two open doors. Go through the left open
door for a treasure chest containing a Mind Potion. Give it to Aguro. Now
exit this room and go through the right open door for a treasure chest
containing a Great Potion. Give it to Lufia. Now exit this room go left and
then up the path and you will soon see an open door to the right. Enter it
and go up the stairs that you come to. In this room, follow the left wall
all the way down the room and to the right. Remember that this is the room
that has 4 pillars in it. You will see an open door and enter it. Go
straight through this room and through the open door at the end of it. This
room has a sign and two chests in it. Read the sign that says "Overcome your
fear!" Open the left chest to get a Power Potion. Give it to Lufia. Open the
right chest for a Spell Potion. Give it to the Hero. Now exit this room. Go
back to the room where you followed the left wall to get here (the one that
has 4 pillars in it). In the lower left part of this room is a set of stairs
going up. Go up these stairs. In this room if you go up a bit you will see
another room in the middle of this room. Go up and around this middle room
and you will see two treasure chests at the top. Open them to receive 2 Mid
Arrows. Go back down and enter the middle room. There is a man and two beds
in here. Before you speak to the man restores the Hero's HP and MP to full.
This guy is Artea's apprentice, who you were looking for. He refuses to tell
you where Artea lives until you challenge him to a one-on-one duel!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


============================================================================
                             BOSS - Apprentice
============================================================================
WEAK AGAINST: Mid Arrows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good luck! This guy is an absolute bastard! Seeing as though you don't have
any attacking magic you are stuck with physical attacks and Items. Mostly I
have found that this attacks you twice for each attack you give him. He can
do a Jolt move that can do up to 40 damage to you, so keep your HP RIGHT UP!
Don't feel upset if he beats you first try because he is very difficult. I
still have trouble beating him after fighting him many times. If you have
many Mid Arrows in your items use them as much as possible against him
because they will probably do twice the damage that physical attacks will
do. Otherwise just keep physically attacking him and healing yourself as
much as possible. You should be able to do it with the Hero at least at
Level 13.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have beaten him, he will tell you that Artea lives if Elfrea which
is a long way away. He will also give you a Speed Potion which you should
give to the Hero. Now make your way out of the tower. You can do this
quickly by falling off one of the open sides that the tower has where a wall
should be. Once you get back to the world map, you should realise that there
is still one more item that you should get in the tower before doing
anything else. I suggested going to the world map first, because instead of
going all through the tower to get it again, this item is near the start, so
it is quicker if you re-enter the tower to get it. So, from the entrance of
the tower, follow the left path and go up a bit. You will see an open door
to the right of you. Go through this door. In the next room, follow the path
down and enter the open door that you come to. In this room, there is a
single treasure chest containing a Sonic Ring (+1 DFP, +5 AGL). Equip it to
Aguro. Now exit the tower again and head for Grenoble.

Once you get back to Grenoble, rest at the Inn and save your game at the

him. Pay him and head to the room where they assign you Old Cave tasks.
Speak to the man behind the counter and accept the 3rd Level Task. You will
have to get the Silver Wick from the 3rd Level to get 1000G. Now exit
Grenoble and head back to the Old Cave.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get on the elevator and hit the switch to go down to the 3rd Level. Once
again there are many chests in here so I will again list them all at the end
of this section in the most probable order that you will find them in. Make
sure you still open all the treasure chests that you found. Follow the path
down and go through the open door at the end of it. Go straight up and
through the open door at the top of the room. This room contains two
treasure chests, so open them. Exit this room and go right and through the
open door at the right part of the room. Follow the path down a bit. You
notice two muck pools. One to the left side of the path and one to the right
side of the path. Get the Hero to cast Float and walk through the right muck
pool and examine around the middle of the pool for a Miracle. Now keep going
down the path and down the ladder. Follow the path to the right and up and
go through the door at the end of it. One of the treasure chests in the next
room contains a Brone Breast (+10 DFP). Equip it to Lufia. Another chest in
this room contains a Brone Helm (+11 DFP). Equip it to the Hero. Another
chest in this room contains a Broad Sword (+81 ATP, cursed). Don't equip
this sword because it is cursed. Go through the open door at the end of this
room. One of the chests in the next room contains Spike Shoes (+5 ATP, +4
DFP). Equip these to the Hero. Another chest in this room contains a Water
Ring. Equip it to Lufia. The last chest in this room contains the Silver
Wick. Now you have everything, make your way out of the Old Cave. The
chests in the 3rd Level contain a Hi Potion, a Bomb, a Sour Cider, a Magic
Guard, an Escape, a Revive, a Smoke Ball, a Miracle, a Sweet Water, Hi
Arrows, Float, a Hi Potion, a Brone Breast, an Apron, a Brone Helm, a
Revive, a Broad Sword, Spike Shoes, a Water Ring and the Silver Wick. Once
you think you have everything on this list, head back to Grenoble.

When you arrive on the world map, head up to the Northwest Tower. You will
notice that on the way there you will walking to the right of a very hilly
area. You will also notice that at the top of the big mountain you can go
around it and explore the land to the left of the mountain. Do this and head
down the path and left across the bridge. Now head up and you will see a
temple ahead. Enter it. Make your way through the rooms, and speak to the
guy that you will come to (you will have to walk to the left at the last
room to see him). He will restore your party's HP and MP. Now leave this
area and back to the world map. Head down the map, across the bridge at the
bottom, and keep going down. Soon you will be at a crossroads where you can
go either left or right of a big mountain. Head right and you will very soon
see a small village. Enter it.

When you get here rest at the Inn. While you are here, go into the back area
of the Inn where all the beds are. You will see five shelves along the back
wall. Examine the left three for a Bomb, a Hi Potion and a Mid Arrow. Now
head to the item shop in the upper right part of town. Enter through the
right door and examine the two shelves in front of you for a Sweet Water and
a Hi Potion. Now head towards the back room of the item shop. You will see a
short scene between a young boy and a girl lying in bed. The girl, Reyna, is
sick and tells us that no medicine can cure her. The boy, Mark, tells her
that he will try and borrow the Hope Ruby from the town of Medan which makes
hopes come true. He then leaves for Medan, telling Reyna that he will come
back with the Hope Ruby. Now speak to Reyna in bed and she tells you that
Medan is east of Kirof, you also find out that Mark is Reyna's boyfriend.
Go around both sides of the table in here examining in the direction of the
two shelves and you will receive a Stuffed Dog and a Stuffed Pig. Leave this
house and enter the house to the left of the item shop, with the old lady in
it. Examine the shelf in here for a Plum Cider. Now exit this town and head
east on the world map and enter the large town called Medan.

ENEMIES IN THIS AREA: None
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rest at the Inn and save your game at the Church. If you are having trouble
finding the Inn (don't worry, I did for a little while), it's the room just
to the right of the entrance. Go to the weapons shop and buy two Spears
(780G x 2, +53 ATP) and a Mace (600G, +45 ATP). Equip the Spears to the Hero
and to Aguro. Equip the Mace to Lufia. Now go to the armour shop and buy two
Chain Mails (960G x 2, +20 DFP), a Chain Cloth (1100G, +18 DFP), two Wood
Shields (360G x 2, +7 DFP) and a Wood Helm (540G, +8 DFP). Equip the Chain
Mails and the Wood Shields to the Hero and to Aguro. Equip the Chain Cloth
to Lufia. Equip the Wood Helm to Aguro. Go to the item shop. I suggest
buying some Mystery Pins, some Magic Guards, some Power Gourds and some Mind
Gourds if you have the money. And, of course, make sure you have enough
Potions and Antidotes. Now go into the house to the right of the Inn.
Examine the two shelves for a Swing Wing and an Escape. Head towards the
castle. Try to enter it and you will see Mark running out. Lufia stops him
and asks him what's wrong. He says that the King wouldn't even see him so he
couldn't even ask him to borrow the Hope Ruby to bring to Reyna. He then
runs off. Proceed into Medan Castle. Before entering the castle, head left
before the entrace, and you will notice that there are three small flower
patches. Examine the left-most flower patch for an Ex Potion. Now head to
the right of the castle entrance. You will see three more flower patches.
Examine the right-most flower patch for an Ex Magic. Finally enter the
castle. Head straight up through the open doors until you get to the room
with the Hope Ruby in it. After speaking to everyone here walk up to the
Ruby and Lufia will make a wish. She throws in a coin into the water and
asks the hero to ask her what she wished for. After he asks her, she refuses
to tell him. Now leave this room, and take the right path. Follow it and go
down the stairs that you come to. Follow the path and you will see a quick
scene. You will find out that the Hope Ruby is really a fake! It's actually
made of glass. If you try to talk to the princess and the man you will be
kicked out. So head back to the entrance that leads to the Hope Ruby room.
Once at the entrance, head down through the door to go to the previous room.
Now follow the path to the left, which will lead up, and will end with a set
of stairs going up. Go up these stairs. Once you get upstairs, just go down
through the open door at the bottom of the room. In the next room, enter the
main room that is around the middle of the floor. This room is the king's
throne. Speak to the King and you find out that there is rumour that the
Sinistral Amon has been revived! Well, now exit the castle and start walking
towards the exit of Medan. You will see Mark running off past you followed
by some guards. You find out that Mark has stolen off with the Hope Ruby and
has gone to Kirof. So leave Medan and head back west for Kirof.

notice an open door along the top wall. Enter this room and follow the path
to receive an Escape inside a chest. Leave this room and head right and up
along the path and go down the stairs that you come to. Go through this room
and down the stairs at the end of it. In this next room, go to the left part
of the room for a Speed Potion. Give it to the Hero. Now go up the stairs in
this room. Keep going up sets of stairs in the next rooms until you are in a
room with a treasure chest and three sets of stairs going down. Open the
chest for a Hi Magic. After opening the chest go down the stairs at the top
right of the room. Go through the next room and up the stairs. Open the
chest for a Dragon Egg. Now go back to the room with the three sets of
stairs going down.

LIST OF MONSTERS
=================
This is a list of every monster that I encountered in the game, and a bit
about what they look like, what special skills they have, and I will
place the monsters in order of appearance during the course of the game.
Also I will tell you where the monsters are found, how much gold they
give you, how many HP they have, how much experience they give you, and
what level your character should be at to beat them. Lastly I will
include actual dropped items from them during a battle. This took a heck
of a lot of work, and many late nights, but I finally have the list ready
and hopefully all correct. If you see any errors or you have a monster, or
attribute that I haven't got, please don't hesitate to e-mail me. My e-mail
address is comleyd@arcom.com.au. I also found that finding out a monster's
HP will very difficult because there is no item that tells you this
information. So I just wrote down on a piece of paper exactly how many HP of
damage I caused and wrote down the result.

FEEDBACK
=========
I would really like to know what you think of my guide, as well as what you
think of the game, and games nowadays in general. If you would like to give
me suggestions, comments, praise, etc. you can do it these ways:

E-mail me at comleyd@arcom.com.au and I will get back to you as soon as
possible.

Contact me through ICQ: my UIN is 6822104.

Well, I look forward to hearing from you!


============
MY THOUGHTS
============
I never that writing a guide would be so addictive! I also didn't realise how
hard it would be either! But it has all been a fun process so far. Although
this last version (0.4) has caused some headaches because it's been very
tough. I had many late nights and many problems but I got it done! I would
like to thank CaSPeR for introducing me to the world of RPG'ing a few years
back. RPG's have given me much fun over the last few years. To anyone who I
should thank and haven't yet, maybe I'll remember next version :) Once again,
if anybody has any comments, suggestions, questions, etc. don't hesitate to
e-mail me at comleyd@arcom.com.au and I'll get back to you real soon. I am
proud to say that so far in this guide, I have not used any external sources
in gathering up information for this guide. I am sure that will change over
the next couple of version or so, because this is getting hard! If I get any
good feedback from this guide, I will most probably end up writing some more
guides either for the Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 or the PlayStation. A
couple of games I am closely considering next are Bomberman 64 on the N64, or
maybe Bomberman Hero. Or perhaps I will make a guide to the sequel of Lufia,
Lufia 2. But all of this is looking way down the track, because I've got a
tonne of more work to go on this one, which I'm looking forward to! Don't
forget, keep checking back at Gamefaqs (www.gamefaqs.com) for new versions of
this guide. And one more thing before I go: comleyd@arcom.com.au is my e-mail
address if you want to get in contact with me. I'll get back to you as soon as
possible.

THANKS
=======
Casper: He was the guy who introduced me to RPG's in the first place. Many
 thanks goes to him.
BlackData: Another friend who seems to only like the Ultima RPG series. He says
 he is an RPG fan, yet he hates the Final Fantasy series and thinks Lufia is
 too cutesy! Hopefully he'll see there's more to life than Ultima :)
Mark: An old friend who I've known for ten years, who only seems to like car
 racing games for some reason.
Microchick: My first girlfriend that I met on the net, and the relationship
 actually worked out for 7 months! We had some good times!
Square: The Final Fantasy series has given me much enjoyment over the past few
 years, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of Final Fantasy 8 over here.
ICQ: It is really a great program that lets everybody stay in contact with
 each other online. Too many idiots on there now :)
Konami: Metal Gear Solid is really a great game that I really enjoy. The bad
 thing is the week after I got it, the CD got a little too scratched, so I
 need to get another copy.
Namco: The developers of the Tekken fighting game series. This is definitely
 my favourite fighting game series, and I hope there are many more Tekken
 games to come...

will too if you visit them. But please don't e-mail me about have crap links,
because these are the links that "I" like. I will try to keep this link list
as up to date as possible, although some of the pages might go down in the near
future, it's not my choice. Also, please don't ask me for more links about
certain things, because if you want to find out more about something, why don't
you go and look for them yourself?
