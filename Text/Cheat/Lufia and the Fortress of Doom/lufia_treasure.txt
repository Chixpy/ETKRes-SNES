Introduction [001]

This guide list all treasures in Lufia & The Fortress of Doom. I was suprised 
that when I started to play that no such list existed in GameFAQ which 
usually has a very througly analysizes of the popular games that everyone 
used to play in 90s. This list is based on a list created by Lufia_Maxim but 
lists also those treasures that are not in his list. I actually ended up 
making a database of the treasures so in this guide you are going to see some 
interesting (statistical) analysis of the treasures. Notice that this is not 
a walkthrough altouhg all items contain instructions how the get them. For a 
walkthrough consult different guides in GameFAQ or web. Without boring you 
any longer, here is my first contribution to GameFAQ. Enjoy :)

The treasure list [002]

The list is exported straight from the database to csv format. I didn't bother 
trying edit it because a text file is just too simple to represent all the
relationships properly. The recommended way to look at it, is to copy and
paste it to Open Office Calc (select comma as separated by parameter) or some
other software that understands csv.

Here are the explanations for the fields:
place means the town/cave/tower where the item is found, item
means the name of item you get, type means whether the item is a chest or "got
item" (more on this later), counted means whether the item is counted towards
the findable 655 chests or 136 got items that the game keeps track of and
finally the missable column tells whether the item is missable so that you
cannot get it after a certain point in game.

So, a little bit more on item type. Items can be found from chests or laying
around for example in a bookcase or they can be handed to you by some people.
Item can also be a scenario item, that will be listed in different list in the
game menu than the rest of the items. Handed items do not count towards the
655 chests or 136 got items. Scenario items count if they are found from a
chest. There is also one special chest (Broken Sapphire) that doesn't count
towards the 655 chests. Also the chests in the beginning quest with Maxim
don't count.

As you can see most of them are complete garbage 'Empy' being the most common
one. Although empty chests can only be found from Old Cave. But things like 47
Revives really makes you wonder, did they really have to put so many chests
that mostly contain stuff that can be bought cheaply from almost any an item
shop.

Scenario items [004]

Here is the scenario item list. They can all be found from the treasure list
above, but I thought that a short list would be good to include:

Red Sapphire
Blue Jade
Shrine key
Light Key
Purple Newt
Magic Flavor
Pirate Key

Closing Words [006]

So, here it is. All the information that you always wanted to know about the
treasures of Lufia & The fortress of Doom. Now you properly wonder, how did I
find out what chests count and what don't. Well, I played the game using ZSnes
emulator and found out where the game stores the count information about the
chests and got items found. This can be found from following places:
7E1360 and 7E1361 (two bytes) store the found chest count and 7E1362 (one
byte) saves the got item count. Using this information, I just checked from
time to time wheter the database count matches the in game value. This leads
to a conclusion that there can be no single item error. If there is a error it
has to be inside one place and there has to be two entries wrong with the
counted items. In one case this almost happened, but I am pretty sure that the
list is accurate.

Here are my final statistics after a try again rerun. I didn't use any cheats
other than checking the values of the chest and got item counters:

Play Time: 21:31
Dead count:     0    (The only annoyace are enemies that use instant death or
                      confusion)
Jeros Dead cnt: 0
Lufia Dead cnt: 0
Aguro Dead cnt: 0
Jerin Dead cnt: 0
Rest count:     0    (This wasn't as difficult as it might seem: when you want
                      to rest, just warp to Alekia and let the old man in the
                      temple heal you.)
Battle count: 1166
Runaway count:  0    (Just keep using those Sweet Waters, otherwise is's a real
                      pain to get forward.)
Boss lose cnt:  0    (Should be easy in Try again mode)
Opened Box:  655/655 (As you might expect)
Got item:    136/136


Anyway, thank you for reading this guide. Hope you enjoyed it.

Thanks for Lufia_Maxim for providing a base item list to work with. Most of
the instructions are from his item list.
