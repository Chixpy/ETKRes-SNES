LUFIA AND THE FORTRESS OF DOOM

Character Maximum Guide - Date/Version 1.06.27

------------------------ Introduction ------------------------

After a grueling couple of hours of experimentation, I created
these three Pro Action Replay codes which will pretty much max
out your characters in the first LUFIA game for the SNES.

Why make a guide simply for three codes?  Well, when I started
playing the game, I looked around for codes that would help me
skip all the annoying leveling-up in the game.

I play RPGs for the stories, not the battles.  There's nothing
that I hate more than to really get into the game, and then be
forced to put that aside just to level myself up enough to get
past some enemy to continue the game.

Unfortunately, all the codes I found were ones that gave you a
"false high" (so to speak.)  For example, try one of the codes
in the other guides that sets one of your attributes to 999.

Save your game after making sure the code works.  Now turn off
the game and remove the Pro Action Replay (or disable "cheats"
if you're using an emulator.)  Now turn the game back on.  Are
you still at 999?  Nope, it's been set back to whatever number
you had before using the code.

And how about items?  The only codes I could find that'll help
you get a desired item were ones that "might" give you an item
after a battle (with a 70% chance of success.)  What does this
mean?  More battles...

------------- The Codes: Maximize Your Character -------------

Use the following three codes, and you'll need to win just one
battle to level up your character all the way.  Be prepared to
press the "B" button quite a lot though, as it details all the
spells and attribute you've acquired with the experience.

7E141AFF + 7E141BFF + 7E141CFF


--------------- The Codes: Maximize Your Money ---------------

This code will give you the most gold that you can acquire per
battle (65,535 Gold Pieces.)  In just a few battles, you'll be
set for life.

7E141DFF + 7E141EFF


------------- The Codes: Maximize Your Inventory -------------

Here's my pride and joy.  By using this code, it will give you
any item in the game (and even some that were removed from the
game - Note the "Dummy" items.)

7E16C0??

How it works:

Look at the charts below and find the hex code that represents
the item you want to obtain.  Let's say you'd like to have the
Might Sword right now.  That's represented by the code: E2

Take the above code and replace the ?? with the item hex code,
which in this case is E2.  That makes the code: 7E16C0E2

Enable this code and when you go into the Hero's equip screen,
you'll see that the item you chose is now in your weapon slot.
(This will even work with non-weapon items.  Ha ha!)  Now just
unequip the item, and you'll find that instead of removing the
item, you simply placed a duplicate of it into your item list.

Now just keep unequipping the item until you have your desired
amount of that item.  Then, once you're done with that, change
codes to a different item and repeat the process.

I found this method really easy, since I was using an emulator
to find these codes (they didn't sell Pro Action Replays where
I lived, I own a Game Genie.)  And Snes9x has a great debugger
for making codes.

Though, I can imagine that this method would be rather tedious
in a real Pro Action Replay device, because then you'd have to
keep turning on and off the game to change the item.

(Note:  You may want to unequip the Hero's weapon before using
this code since it would replace whatever he's holding.)

------------------------ Next Version ------------------------

Will there be another version?  I doubt it.  I originally made
this FAQ back in January 2001, but I was planning on releasing
it once I completed the game again.  Due to several unforeseen
events, I haven't had the time to, so I'm releasing it now.

----------------------- Special Thanks -----------------------

Special thanks go out to my good friend, Kailin, who suggested
this game to me.  I miss you.  May she rest in peace...
