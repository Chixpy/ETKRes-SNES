Section 1:

-- Part 1: Fortress of Doom --
	You start out 100 years before the Hero is even born. You are Maxim and 
his team consisting of Selan, Guy and Artea. Your mission is to defeat the 
Sinistrals for the first time. You start at the entrance of the Fortress of 
Doom. Head all the way up until you enter a door. Head to the right, and then 
head down. Go all the way down until you find a staircase. Go up the staircase, 
and then head up again. You will see stone statues of the Sinistrals. Go up 
further and enter the portal. Go up, and the you will meet the Sinistrals. You 
will fight Gades first who does not use Magic. Use Guy and Maxim to attack with 
their weapons, and use Artea and Selan to use Magic. You will easily defeat him, 
as well of the other 3 Sinistrals. If you want to heal, use Artea’s Valor spell 
after each battle. This will cost you 35 MP, but you most likely will not run 
out of MP for all 4 battles with the Sinistrals. For the next three Sinistrals, 
have Selan and Artea cast mirror on your party members. This will make you near 
invincible for the next three Sinistrals. After you defeat Amon, Erim, and Daos, 
you will be taken ahead 90 years to when the Hero first meets Lufia.

--Part 2: Alekia and Sheran --
Monsters in this area:
Anemone - 17 HP
Baby Crab - 26 HP
Big Newt - 11 HP
Earwig - 17 HP
Green Orb - 16 HP
Jellyfish - 16 HP
Madshroom - 18 HP
Nettles - 18 HP
Spider - 18 HP

	After you hear the rumors that monsters have attacked Sheran, you will 
leave Lufia, and be determined to go to Sheran to see if the rumors are true. 
First, talk to the commander in the castle, as well as the King. If you talk to 
the Princess, she will give you 100 gold pieces. Buy potions and a dagger, and 
anything else you think you will need. You are now ready to build up your level. 
I do not suggest going to Sheran until you have built the Hero up to level 5. To 
get to Sheran, head north from Alekia, past the small town of Chatam. Keep going 
north until you see a cave to your left. This cave will lead you to Sheran. Head 
to the upper left corner of the cave and exit. You will then see the kingdom of 
Sheran. Once you enter the town, you will see many people injured and dying. If 
you enter the castle, you will not see much except two locked doors. Now that 
you know the rumors of a monster attack is true, go back to Alekia. If you talk 
to the commander, he will say that they will not send a detail to Sheran for a 
long time. You are disgusted by this, so you decided to go to Sheran yourself. 
By this time, you will want to go back to the Inn and talk to Lufia. She is mad 
because you left without telling her. If you leave town, Lufia will follow, and 
then join your party. Build up Lufia’s level a little bit, and head back to the 
caves. In Chatam, you should have talked to Danil who says his sister is in 
Sheran castle, when you enter the caves the second time, you will find him 
injured. You tell him to go back to Sheran, and he will give you the key to 
Sheran castle. Go to the castle, and go back to the 2 locked doors. The key will 
unlock the doors, and in the locked room on the left, you will find the switch 
to open a secret entrance in the castle. Go to the staircase leading down in the 
back of the upper level of the castle. Go down the stairs you find until you 
find the prison. The King and a few villagers are here, let them out, and then 
leave the castle. You will then meet Gades, Sinistral of Destruction. Lufia, the 
King, and the villagers will leave for Alekia, but the Hero will try to fight 
Gades. You will attack him a few times, but soon be massacred. Lufia then comes 
to your rescue, and scares Gades away. You will then go back to Alekia. There, 
you will tell Roman that you plan to return Danil’s sister, and then head out 
even farther. Go fetch Danil’s sister from the castle’s guest room, then 
continue on to Chatam. Danil will be pleased, and you will begin your adventure.

-- Part 3: The One --
	Your next stop will be Treck. Treck is a port town, and there’s plenty of 
shops. If you talk to the villagers here, they will talk about an old man who 
likes to watch the sea. Talk this man, and he will then tell a girl in his 
house, Ainia, to take you to see The One. She tells you to head east from Treck. 
You will cross two bridges, and come to a small cave. At the other side of the 
cave is a small house. This is the house of Guy, known as The One. He will tell 
you that you need to stop the Sinistrals, and even tell you to try to find 
Artea. Guy will try to get up, but then die. If you search the cross on his 
grave, you will find a shortsword, which is a good weapon for where you are in 
the game. After Guy dies, head back to Treck. (Be sure to search Guy’s grave for 
a shortsword).

-- Part 4: Aguro and the Maberia --
Demon Lord: 48 HP each

	You will now want to get to Lorbenia, but there are too many monsters 
attacking ships. You will now find guy, and monsters will sink his ship. You 
will then be attacked by four monsters. They can be tough, and it may take you 
awhile to beat them. Make sure your level is around 7 or so. After you defeat 
the monsters, you will need to find the stolen ship, the Maberia. 

-- Part 5: Search for the Maberia --
Goblins: 118 HP each

	You now need to find the Maberia to get to Lorbenia. You will now want to 
do some level building because the monsters that took the Maberia are pretty 
tough. Head North from Treck to a small cave. On the other end of this cave, is 
the Maberia, and Daos’ Servants guarding the ship. Use Lufia to cast flash as 
often as possible, and Aguro and The Hero to heal. When the Goblins die, the 
ship is yours, and you are now ready for Lorbenia.

--Part 6: Lorbenia --
Monsters in this area:
Giant Bat - 26 HP
Giant Newt - 27 HP
Kobold - 16 HP
Mini Demon - 25 HP
Rat - 30 HP
Red Orb - 52 HP
Rok - 127 HP
Roozard - 24 HP

 	You should now be around lvl 8-10. There is not too much you have to do in 
this port town. Aguro leaves your party on some business, and you are now able 
to visit the famous Lorbenia stores. While shopping at the dress shop in the 
Lorbenia “mall” a small boy runs past Lufia. The Hero is not dumb, and realizes 
that the small boy stole money from Lufia. You will meet him outside of the 
store, and learn he is the son of Professor Shaia, the famous inventor. This 
doesn’t mean much until later in the game. You now can stay at the Inn, and 
Aguro will meet you when you awake.


--Part 7: Grenoble and the Old Cave --
	The Old Cave is a great way to earn experience and money. You must visit 
the basement of the Grenoble Tavern. There is an old man here who really wants a 
Fairy Kiss, and item found in the Old Cave. Get assigned a task at the front 
desk, and get this man his Kiss.

Monsters in Old Cave, lvl 2:
Blue Wolf - 63 HP
Gold Orc - 125 HP
Killer Bee - 31 HP
Mace Man - 120 HP
Mud Man - 70 HP
Red Orb - 52 HP
Rok - 127 HP
Sting - 85 HP

	There is a room in the NE corner of the Old Cave that has a sign which 
reads: “Only women may enter.” Lufia goes in and gets the Fairy Kiss. You can 
now go back to Grenoble, give the Kiss to the Old Man, and get the Old Papers to 
give to Artea’s Apprentice. 

-- Part 8: The Apprentice --
Apprentice: 300 HP

Monsters in the North Tower:
Goblin - 32 HP
Huge Bunny - 38 HP
Mini Crab - 30 HP
Rat - 30 HP
Red Magi - 28 HP
Zombie - 41 HP

	Be sure to have lots of potions handy for this tower. The Apprentice is at 
the top of this tower, and he can be tough. Mid-Arrows are a good way to defeat 
him. Heal when necessary, and if all goes well, you will win. When you defeat 
the Apprentice, he tells you to find Artea in Elfrea. Only an elf guide can 
bring you to Elfrea, and you will need to go through Kirof, Medan, and Belgen. 
This is a long journey.

-- Part 9: Kirof and Reyna --

Monsters in this area:
Dracu Rose - 32 HP
Fight - 35 HP
Frog - 44 HP
Spike Newt - 42 HP

	Kirof is a small town West of Medan. In this town, is a small girl who is 
very very sick.  Mark, a small boy from Medan is speaking to Reyna before you 
talk to her. Talk to Reyna, and then head East to Medan Kingdom. Medan is famous 
for its Hope Ruby, rumored to grant the wishes of people. Be sure to look at the 
Hope Ruby, and then explore the rest of the castle. You will eventually hear the 
princess reveal that the Hope Ruby is a fake made of glass. As you leave the 
castle, Mark will run past you. He has the Hope Ruby for Reyna, and is going 
back to Kirof. When you go back to Kirof, you will learn that Reyna disappeared 
in the Ghost Cave. The Ghost cave is North of Kirof.

-- Part 10: The Ghost Cave --
Phantasm: 640 HP

	The Ghost cave is a large cave, then can be confusing. In your searches, 
be sure to find the Ghost Ring. (Don’t leave without it). Head to the SE corner 
of the cave, and you will find a staircase. Eventually, you come to a room with 
2 bridges on the sides. You cannot cross the bridges, so you must walk between 
them, as if there is an invisible bridge there.

How to defeat Phantasm:
	The Phantasm is quite tough. I would recommend using Lufia's Drain spell 
to lower his defensive power. Keep casting this on the Phantasm. Then make sure 
you find the Ghost Ring(found in Ghost Cave). If the Hero or Aguro is equipped 
with the ghost ring, fight the Phantasm with the person wearing the Ghost Ring. 
Use the one who is not wearing the Ghost ring to use potions to heal the 
wounded. If everyone has enough HP, then fight with the person not wearing the 
ghost ring. Just repeat this and you should have no problem defeating the 
Phantom. 

-- Part 11: On to Belgen --
	After you rescue Reyna, head back to Medan. You will see the Princess 
talking to the towns’ people. After her speech, talk to her, and she will say 
you can now head farther east through a cave north of Medan. This little cave is 
quite easy, and you should spend some time leveling here. Your levels should now 
be 15 or so. After the cave, head east to Belgen. The people of this town are in 
an uproar because they had to sacrifice a half-elf, Jerin, to stop monster 
attacks. In this town is a basement with a girl who really wants to save Jerin, 
because Jerin took her spot as the sacrifice victim. She tells you to head SW 
and get the Dais key from her brother who is in a cave south of the Dais Cave. 
Go to this cave, and search it entirely for the good items here. You will 
eventually find her brother, who gives you the key. The cave you now want to get 
to is North of the cave you are currently in, but you will have to go around 
some mountains to get to it. This cave is not too large either, and brings you 
to the Dais. 

-- Part 12: Save Jerin --
Follower: 888 HP

	There is a shrine looking temple on the world map. You must go here. You 
will see Jerin on the altar, waiting for the sacrifice. guards will not let you 
pass, but when you try to leave, the Follower will lift Jerin and head to the 
North Tower. There is a priest and 2 healing buckets here. Use them, and then 
save. You’re up for a new challenge. Head North to the tower, and work your way 
to the top floor. You will need to use warp tiles to find the stairs that lead 
to the top of this tower. Once you are at the top, you will see many warp tiles. 
There are some good items to get here, but to get to the Follower, take the 
eastern most tile. Then go north, and north again. The Follower awaits.

How to defeat the Follower:
	The Follower is not all too difficult. Just attack him like you would a 
really tough monster. Use Lufia to heal if needed, and Aguro and Hero to attack. 
You should really have no trouble defeating this monster, especially if you are 
in the 18-20 level range.

-- Part 13: Suringal, and the Lost Forest --
	After you defeat the Follower, you will return to Kirof, and say farewell 
to Jerin. She does not join your party until later. You can now head east across 
the desert. Talk to the people here and you learn of the Lost Forest, and how 
only an elf can guide you through the forest. Now head south to the guide 
station. When you try to hire a guide, Jerin appears, and joins your party. She 
takes you through the forest, and you can now start the Three Gems Quest. This 
is the Quest most people seem to have trouble with. So pay attention in the next 
part.

-- Part 14: Jenoba --
Monsters in this area:
Archer - 80 HP
Chomp Weed - 97 HP
Skeleton - 90 HP
Spellsnail - 85 HP
Tarantula - 72 HP

	There is something you MUST do in Jenoba, in order to eventually get the 
red gem. There is an old woman in the basement of the Cider House, and you MUST 
buy her tea. All she tells you is that there are three towers, and you need 
three gems to put at the top of the towers. After you do what you want in 
Jenoba, head SE to the Blue Tower.

-- Part 15: The Blue Tower --
Monsters in the Blue Tower:
Dark Elf - 82 HP
Frog - 44 HP
Gargoyle - 106 HP
Horroquin - 76 HP
Jelly Bean - 98 HP

	This is the easiest of the three towers, red being the hardest. Climb up 
the first two floors, and you will come to a room with a hole in the middle. 
Fall down the hole two times, and the second time, you will find the Green Jade. 
You c an now leave the tower, unless you want to build levels. Which I always 
advise doing in this game.

-- Part 16: The Green Tower --
Monsters in the Green Tower:
Gargoyle - 106 HP
Horroquin - 76 HP
Sand Man - 54 HP
Willowisp - 30 HP

	This tower is a little trickier than the Blue Tower. There are switches 
that make certain staircases disappear and appear. When the switch is down, you 
can find the broken red gem. You don’t take the red gem, and you do nothing with 
it. Don’t worry about it. You can get another Red gem later. After cleaning out 
this tower, you’re ready for the red tower. Head east to get to it, but stop at 
Ruan first.

-- Part 17: Ruan and the Red Tower --
Monsters in the Red Tower:
Horroquin - 76 HP
Flamefreak - 120 HP
Flamespook - 48 HP
Gargoyle - 106 HP
Big Meany - 110 HP

	Stop in Ruan before conquering the Red Tower. In this village, speak to 
the jeweler who explains that sapphires are the same as rubies. You also learn 
that the Dark Ghost has kidnapped the Water Fairy, and turned all of the water 
near Ruan into poisonous swamp. After you heal, and stock up on supplies as 
needed, head west to the red tower. In the basement of the red tower, is a room 
completely covered in poisonous swamp. You will need to come back to this room 
after killing the Dark Ghost. Head to the top of the tower, and meet your new 
friend, the Dark Ghost.

How to defeat the Dark Ghost:
	The Ghost can be tough, if you're not prepared for it. I would suggest 
having all of your guys in the 20-22 level range. It will also help a little bit 
if you equip Aguro with the Ghost Ring found in the Ghost Cave north of Kirof. 
Start out Right away by Attacking with Aguro, but have the Hero and Lufia use 
their Drain spells to lower the Ghosts defense. Do whatever you want with Jerin. 
(Try and build Jerin up to level 20 so that the Hero, Lufia, and Jerin all have 
the spell Stronger.) Do this for the first few rounds. Then the Ghost will use 
his Water spell that will hurt your party with 30-50 HP of damage. This is where 
Stronger comes in. Use The Hero, Jerin, and Lufia to heal, while Aguro continues 
to attack. Always attack with Aguro unless you absolutely have to use him for 
something else. Also watch out for when the Ghost uses absorb. He can take away 
a lot of MP from you. The Ghost will regain his Defense after a few rounds so 
use Drain again. Once Drain takes away 20 or less Defense points, keep Draining 
with Lufia but attack with The Hero. Now the Ghost should be pretty hurt. If he 
starts to heal himself, then you know he's almost dead. Now do an all out attack 
with Jerin, The Hero, Aguro, and if you want to stop Draining, attack with Lufia 
also. Eventually, the Ghost will disappear, and the Water Fairy will be saved.

	You can now go back to that room was covered with poisonous swamp, and 
retrieve the Blue Gem. Head back to Ruan to heal, then go back to the Medan 
Mines and speak to the old man in the back. He will not give you the gem if you 
didn’t speak to the old woman in jenoba, defeat the Dark Ghost, and speak to the 
jeweler in Ruan. So be sure you’re ready before going back. He will give you the 
Red Gem if you have done everything you need to do.

-- Part 18: Placing the Gems --
	As you probably learned by now, you need to place the gems in the tower 
corresponding to their color. You also need to do it in a certain order. The 
order of placing the gems is: Blue First, then Green, and finally Red. After you 
place the red gem, you are magically taken to Elfrea. Congratulations! You 
solved the three gems problem! Now don’t e-mail me about it anymore :)

-- Part 19: Elfrea and Artea --
Monsters in this area:
Chomp Weed - 97
Spellsnail - 85
Tarantula - 72

	The elves are shocked to see human visitors, and you eventually meet 
Artea, whom you will remember from the very beginning of the game. He is old 
now, and is now blind. Artea now tells you of your next main goal: Find the Dual 
Blade. Dual Blade was the legendary sword used by your ancestor, Maxim, to 
defeat the Sinistrals. Without this sword, you cannot defeat the Sinistrals. 
Dual Blade is believed to still be at the bottom of the sea where Doom island 
fell. It will be awhile before you are ready to find Dual Blade though, but 
Artea gives you a very valuable weapon, his bow. This bow will be a great weapon 
For Jerin for pretty much the rest of the game. Artea also gives you a key to 
the shrine. This shrine leads to the SE island, and you are now ready to go to 
Ranqs, a town of miners.

-- Part 20: Ranqs and the mysterious cave --
Monsters in this area:
Axe Knight - 132 HP
Ghoul - 127 HP
Gold Orc - 125 HP
Halloween - 72 HP
Harpie - 110 HP
Land Worm - 160 HP
Mace Man - 120 HP
Mimicker - 49 HP
Pin Lizard - 92 HP
Rok - 127 HP
Sting - 85 HP
Yeoman - 90 HP

	All of the men are in the tunnel leading to Odel, and don’t know what to 
do because there is an odd force field blocking their path. Here is the solution 
to the force field (Start at entrance): Up1, Right 2, Up 1, Right2, Up 4, Left 
3, Down 1, Left 2, Down 1, Left 2, Up 2, Right 1, Up 1, Right 2, Then all the 
way up. Now head SW to Odel.

-- Part 21: Piron and the broken Bridge to Arus --
	This bridge problem is kind of a pain in the neck, mainly because of all 
the traveling, but it’s a good way to build experience. You need to get to Arus, 
a town of magicians, but the bridge is out. Piron is an architect in Odel, and 
says he can fix the bridge if he has the help of his friend who is in Lyden, 
enjoying the many cooks that live there.  You should also visit Shaia 
laboratory. The entrance is West then North of Odel. Search around the lab, and 
you’ll eventually learn Professor Shaia has a ship that can travel underwater. 
You’ll need it later to get the Dual Blade. Speak with all of the men in the NW 
basement of the castle about the broken bridge, then talk to the Princess and 
Piron. Now go to Lyden, which is on the SE tip of the island. It’s a long walk, 
so be ready.

-- Part 22: The first visit to Lyden, and Piron begins to fix the bridge --
	Piron’s assistant is in a restaurant in the western side of town. He says 
he’ll help right away, and leaves for Odel. Now go all the back to Odel, talk to 
Piron again, then head SW, cross a bridge, and then head North. This is the cave 
where the broken bridge is, but there are still 2 other entrances to this large 
cave. When you walk in, Piron tells you to stand on the ledge to the right and 
watch his work. I think this is just a way to force you to go through that damn 
big cave. Leave this cave, and enter the Northernmost cave entrance. Work your 
way through the cave, and you’ll eventually come to the ledge. When the bridge 
is done, go back to the bridge, and you’ll now be able to get to Arus.

-- Part 23: Arus --
Monsters in this area:
Armorlord - 109 HP
Blue Meany - 103 HP
Crazy Jar - 101 HP
Ice Snake - 104 HP
Mimicker - 49 HP

	You need to find an elder named Flake here, but he went to the Tower of 
Grief. Lufia will also dance through the Priphea in this town, and then you can 
go. To get to the Tower of Grief, head West from Arus, then go through the cave. 
Then head North.

-- Part 24: Flake, Tower of Grief, and Professor Shaia --
	This is an easy tower, with no big boss at the top, just the friendly 
Flake. When you talk to Flake, he tells you more about Dual Blade. Flake also 
increases Lufia’s MP by 10 whole points! You now need to find Professor Shaia. 
Go back to Odel and Shaia Lab 2. Take the West exit to Platina. You meet Raile 
Shaia, and he takes you on a little trip in the Falcon, which can travel 
underwater. The ship isn’t ready for a dangerous trip like the one to Doom 
Island, so you need Alumina. The Professor does let you keep Falcon to travel 
above water though. Shaia also asks you to meet him at Carbis directly west of 
Platina. He then gives you Falcon. Shaia tells you to find his assistant Cooper, 
who is in Bakku. Bakku is west of Carbis.

Monsters near Carbis:
Blue Wisp - 61 HP
Crazy Jar - 101 HP
Ghoul - 127 HP
Giant Oak - 130 HP
Ice Snake - 104 HP
Pin Lizard - 91 HP

-- Part 25: Cooper, Bakku, and the Old Cave -- 
Monsters near Bakku:
Axe Knight - 132 HP
Frogula - 130 HP
Harpie - 110 HP
Land Worm - 160 HP
Pin Lizard - 91 HP
Trap Harp - 241 HP

	When you get to Bakku, the cleric tells you that Cooper went to explore 
the 5th level of the Old cave NW of Grenoble. Go back to Grenoble and get 
assigned the 5th level task. Search around this cave, and you’ll eventually find 
Cooper. When you find him, Jerin warps everyone to Shaia Lab 3 on Carbis. You 
now learn about the quest for 7 pieces of Alumina. This is another fairly long 
quest, and you’ll build up your levels a lot throughout this quest. The 
Professor now tells you to go to Linze, and find Brant, who is also looking for 
Alumina. I think the professor is just an old man who makes you do his dirty 
work.
 
-- Part 26: The Tower of Light --
Monsters in this area:
Cave Rok - 154 HP
Crazy Pine - 190 HP
Killer Lily - 31 HP
Land Worm - 160 HP
Sabrespook - 120 HP
Terrorquin - 100 HP
Trap Harp - 241 HP
Were Frog - 163 HP
Werewolf - 150 HP
Zaurus - 470 HP
Zooster - 138 HP

Guardian: ? HP

	To get to Linze, you need a key that opens a door at the rear of the 1st 
floor of the Tower of Light. And guess what? The key is gone! The key was stolen 
by Amon’s Guardian. This tower is pretty tough, and you’ll need to fall through 
traps to get where you need to go. Work your way to the top, and introduce 
yourself to a challenging enemy, the Guardian.

How to defeat the Guardian:
	This guy is tough. He practically constantly uses a magic attack, either 
Flame or Blizzard. He also uses Drain and Absorb occasionally. Flame and 
Blizzard will be bad for Aguro, so give him the Yellow Ring to wear to raise his 
Magic Resistance. Right away in battle, have the Hero and Lufia use Drain twice 
each. This'll lower his very high Defense power. Don't even bother using magic 
to attack him. He's got amazing MGR. Use Aguro to attack throughout the entire 
battle unless it is absolutely necessary to use him to heal or whatever. Use the 
Hero to heal, because you'll get hurt almost every round. If you're doing ok HP 
wise, use him to attack. Use Lufia and Jerin to heal party members, or if you 
can, use Lufia's Drain spell, because the Guardian regains lost Defense. If 
everything goes ok, you'll defeat the Guardian, and meet Amon and Gades. They’ll 
bully you a bit, but not attack. Then get the Tower of Light Key. Use the key on 
the door at the rear of the first floor, and move on to Linze.

-- Part 27: Linze and Gayas Cave--
Locations of all Alumina:
Gayas Cave (east of Linze): 1 piece
Loire Island: 1 piece
Ulupp Island: 2 pieces
Elba Island: 1 piece
Brant: Gives you 1 piece when you help him escape Loire Cave
King Herat: Gives you 1 piece when you bring him the purple newt

	After all that work to meet Brant, you learn that he has left to go meet 
his girlfriend in Marse, which is past Gayas cave. You also learn that Alumina 
is mostly found in the Fargo islands near Marse. Coincidence? The entrance to 
Gayas cave is actually in the basement of a house in Linze. The first piece of 
Alumina is in the middle of the first floor poison pool. There is also a switch 
you need to switch down. The switch is in the middle of three doors right next 
to each other. You will also find Clack in this cave, A doom island researcher. 
He tells you that Doom island fell in the middle of the ringed island. You can 
now head NW to Marse when you leave the cave.

-- Part 28: Marse and the three caves --
Monsters in this area:
Blue Skull - 170 HP
Cave Rok - 154 HP
Demon Mace - 152 HP
Eye Curse - 158 HP
Green Magi - 149 HP
Mud Ghoul - 228 HP
Nailman - 158 HP
Red Wolf - 175 HP
Redcore - 101 HP
Sabrespook - 120 HP
Troll - 285 HP
Vampire - 171 HP
Werewolf - 150 HP
Zaurus - 470 HP

	You can take a cruise here in Marse, and see the the three islands you 
will eventually have to search. You will notice a ship by Loire island, 
indicating Brant is probably there. Loire should be your first island to visit. 
To find Brant, fall through a trap door in the center of Loire island, but not 
before you find the Alumina in this cave. When you talk to Brant, he tells you 
where to find the rest of the Alumina, and also gives you a piece he found.
	Now go to Elba Island. There is a ledge near the entrance with four doors. 
Enter the door second from the right, and flip the switch in the room. This 
opens a door in the eastern part of the cave. Go down a long ladder next to a 
door in the NE corner, and locate the warp to Ulupp. There is a piece of Alumina 
here. Go back through the portal, flip the switch, and warp back to Ulupp to 
retrieve Ulupp’s second piece of Alumina. The piece in Elba island is through a 
NE door on the second level. The piece is here. You should now have 6 pieces of 
Alumina. It is time to visit King Herat.

-- Part 29: King Herat and the Purple Newt --
	To get to Herat, sail down a river west of Marse. The King Here really 
wants a new flavor because he likes eating so much. He knows that there is a 
purple newt in a cave east of Herat. You must retrieve the newt to create a new 
flavor. To reach the cave east of Herat, sail back up the river, sail west, and 
park on the desert area. Head all the way south, past the Dragon Shrine, and 
then East, then North to the cave. This isn’t a big cave, but you need to flip a 
switch in the NE corner. Use the warp, and the newt is in one of the chests 
here. Now go to Lyden. The Master of Taste has returned, and will make a flavor 
out of your newt. He gives you the flavor, and then you can return to Herat. 
Give the flavor to the King, and he will reward you by giving you his piece of 
Alumina. As well as many other items.

-- Part 30: Aisen Island and Pirate Tower --
Monsters is this area:
Berserker - 154 HP
Blue Skull - 170 HP
Dark Spook - 139 HP
Fire Plate - 180 HP
Steel Lord - 183 HP
Vampire - 171 HP
 
	So now you’re ready to get the Falcon fixed and retrieve Dual Blade right? 
Wrong! When you return to Carbis, you learn the Raile Shaia went to Pirate Tower 
to save his son Lou, whom you met in Lorbenia at the store. If you took the 
cruise in Marse, then you remember that Aisen island is west of the three 
islands. You find Raile on the second floor, locked away in prison. Lou is at 
the top. Work your way up until you come to a door with four switches in front 
of it. You must step on the switches in a specific order to open the door. If 
you make a mistake, you are attacked by pirates. The correct order is: Top Left, 
Bottom Right, Bottom Left, Top Right. You can now try to defeat Bosun and the 
Pirate.

Bosun - 1,288 HP
Pirate - 3,480 HP

How to defeat Bosun and the Pirate:
	These 2 really aren't that tough, HP wise, but are a challenge 
nonetheless. First of all, kill Bosun. He's the little guy on the left. He will 
cast spells on the big Pirate to regain his HP or raise his ATP and DFP. Once 
Bosun's out of the way, its just a matter of time before you kill the big guy. 
Throughout most of the match, the 2 pirates will use different kinds of arrows 
to change the status of your team members. Your guys will be confused, 
paralyzed, and put to sleep, so be ready to use awaken and what-not to regain 
your normal status. Also, if Jerin is level 32 or above, she will have the spell 
Mirror, which reflects all enemy magic. If you cast Mirror on Aguro, it will 
protect him from Flood, which the big guy will use later in the fight. It will 
also protect your characters from status changing magic. Attack with Aguro and 
the Hero, and if you must heal with the Hero, do so. I didn't really find any 
magic that was greatly effective against these 2 pirates, but that doesn't mean 
you can't use it. If all goes well, you will defeat the pirates, and rescue Lou. 
Get the key, and go release Raile. Now you can go to Carbis, and get Falcon 
fixed!

-- Part 31: Soshette, the ringed island --
Monsters in this area:
Fire Plate - 180 HP
Griffon - 285 HP
Mad Wolf - 191 HP
Mega Frog - 389 HP
Megaturtle - 266 HP
Sea Snake - 171 HP
Steel Lord - 183 HP

	You have to sail to Soshette, and then to go below sea, enter on of the 
spinning whirlpools, called Eddys. Dive into the Eddy NE of the ringed island. 
Now navigate your way through the underwater cave, and you will eventually come 
to Doom Island, sitting at the bottom of the sea. 
	
-- Part 32: Doom Island --
Monsters in this area:
Griffon - 285 HP
Hydra - 321 HP
Mad Wolf - 191 HP
Mega Frog - 389 HP
Megaturtle - 266

	The fortress hasn’t changed a bit, so to get to Dual Blade, go all the 
way, all the way right, then all the way down until you hit a staircase. Go up 
the stairs, then up. You will see Dual Blade. When you retrieve Dual Blade, the 
Sinistrals appear. You also hear Daos claim that Lufia is Erim, the last 
Sinistral. The Sinistrals raise Doom Island, and fly away. Now you need a way to 
fly up to Doom Island... You automatically return to Soshette, and rest.

-- Part 33: Epro and Hedge --
	Return to Carbis and speak to Shaia. He will tell you that Falcon could 
fly if he had some Power Oil. He sends you to Epro, a town on the last continent 
of the game (North of Marse). Epro is famous for its Power Oil. Shaia tells you 
to bring the Power Oil to Shaia Lab 4, Frederia. Sail from Marse to Epro, and 
speak to the people there. Unfortunately, getting Power Oil won’t be as easy as 
buying it from a store. A landslide has halted production, and a man named Hedge 
is the only one with information about Power Oil. Hedge can be found on the 
world map, NW of Epro. You must speak to him to get the Power Oil Key. The only 
way to enter the Oil Cave is by entering from underwater. Enter the eddy E then 
N of Marse.

-- Part 34: Power Oil Quest --
Monsters in this area:
Hydra - 321 HP
Magura - 236 HP
Manta Ray - 224 HP
Sea Dragon - 279 HP
Mad Knight - 279 HP
Mega Frog - 389 HP
Rock Golem - 262 HP
Efreet - 288 HP
Griffon - 285 HP
Mad Wolf - 191 HP

Sail through the underwater passage way, and enter the cave by using the key. 
Locate the Dragon Ring, and use it to fight the Oil Dragon. Work your way to the 
NE part of the basement and defeat the dragon.

How to defeat the Oil Dragon:
Oil Dragon - 4,650 HP
I don't find the Oil Dragon all that challenging, but I will still tell you how 
I beat him. First of all, use The Hero and Lufia to cast Drain, this will lower 
his defense. Then use Aguro to attack. If you found the Dragon Ring in the Oil 
Cave earlier, have Aguro equip it. Use Jerin to either heal, or use her Mirror 
spell to repel against the Dragon's powerful fire attacks. For the rest of the 
battle, use Lufia to either cast her Thunder spell, which is quite effective 
against the Dragon, or use Lufia to heal anyone who may be hurt. Also use the 
Hero to either fight or heal. Everything should go fine, and eventually you'll 
kill the dragon. The Power Oil is in the chest behind him. Grab the Oil, and go 
to Frederia, which is South of Carbis.

-- Part 35: The Road to Glasdar Tower --
Monsters near the Glasdar Key Cave:
Efreet - 288 HP
Mad Knight - 279 HP
Rock Golem - 262 HP
Wing Lion - 289 HP
Zaurus Rex - 305 HP

You are now very close to the end of the game. Maybe 2 hours or so untill the 
end. Give the Power Oil to the Professor, and he will make the alterations to 
Falcon. You can now fly! Go to Arubus, and stock up on the great items here. The 
road to Glasdar Tower, and the way to the top is challenging. I’d say the most 
challenging part of the game. And why shouldn’t it be? We’re almost done. Arubus 
is only accesible by air, and is West of Fredaria. You must first get the Key to 
Glasdar Tower. A man in Arubus will tell you the way for some Apple Cider. The 
cave that houses the Glasdar Key is North of the tower. In your search of this 
large cavern like cave, you’ll find a room with a small pool of water. Flip the 
switch here, then exit the room, and retrieve the Glasdar Key. Leave the cave. 
You are now ready to conquer Glasdar Tower.

-- Part 36: Glasdar Tower, and Nazeby --
Hope you’re ready for this tower. Make sure all of your levels are in the 50’s 
range. This tower is sort of confusing, if you don’t know what you’re doing. 
Along the way, you’ll see signs which tell you what floor you’re on. Make sure 
the signs are going up in number. Eventually, you’ll come to three switches 
right in a row. You must step on the correct switch in order to proceed to the 
top. The correct switch is the middle one. Once you are at the very top, Nazeby 
will appear as the Sinistrals last resort. Defeat him.

How to defeat Nazeby:
Nazeby - 5,468 HP
Nazeby is the last enemy you'll fight before the Sinistrals. I do not believe 
Nazeby is all that tough, but if I write about him, I have an excuse to use his 
picture. Now that Jerin has Mirror, use her to constantly cast that spell on the 
party one by one. This will make you virtually untouchable by Nazeby. Then use 
The Hero, Aguro, and even Lufia to fight. Of course have Lufia use magic... 
Hopefully your level will be high enough so that the Hero has Valor, which 
restores all of your party's HP. If you're ever seriously hurt, use this spell. 
After a few rounds, Nazeby will die, and you continue on with your quest.

When Nazeby dies, the Sinistrals, minus Erim, will appear. Lufia, who is really 
Erim, steals Dual Blade from The Hero as he is unconscious. She joins the 
Sinistrals for the next three big bosses. Doom Island then flies to just NW of 
the Tower of Grief, which was near Arus remember. Get ready, because you are now 
going to beat the game.

-- Part 37: The Final Battle --
Monsters in Doom Island:
Act Hydra - 289 HP
Electromaz - 249 HP
Fire Wave - 206 HP
Green Core - 200 HP
Water Sprout - 242 HP
Whirlwind - 189 HP
Mega Atlas - 206 HP
Gold Golem - 125 HP
Act Dragon - 705 HP
Dragon - 567 HP
Act Demon - 343 HP

Stock up on supplies, and do whatever you want to do before attempting Doom 
Island. Once you enter Doom Island, you’re at the end of the road. No more 
towns, or priests. The last person you meet is your friend at the shrines. He 
heals you as you pass through his shrine. To get to Doom island, just fly into, 
and Land the Falcon near the shrine. Since you’ve walked through the Fortress of 
Doom twice before, you should know the way to the Sinistrals by now. The order 
in which you will fight them is: Gades, Amon, Daos, and Guard Daos. Here is the 
strategy for the final fight:

Gades -  3,000 HP
Amon - 3,000 HP
Daos - 3,000 HP
Guard Daos - 6,304 HP

How to defeat the Sinistrals and Guard Daos:
The Sinistrals are easy. Almost too easy. First you fight Gades. He's really the 
only Sinistral that will do some damage to you. Just fight him like you would 
any boss. He doesn't use magic, so don't bother using Mirror. Use Trick on the 
Hero and Aguro to boost your ATP. Gades will eventually die. Now, for the next 
three guys, Amon, Daos, and Guard Daos, use this hint. Use Jerin's mirror on 
everyone in the party, and simply attack with Hero and Aguro. It's flawless. As 
long as you constantly keep casting the mirror on everyone in your party, they 
can't hurt you! Amon, Daos, and Guard Daos never attack without magic! So 
they're easy. Lufia will join you for Guard Daos. Do what ever you want with 
her. That's how ya do it. Now sit back, and watch the end of the game unfold.

You have just beat the game. Congratulations! The rest of this walkthrough, is 
just extra information for you to know. I hope this walkthrough has helped, and 
I hope you enjoyed Lufia and the Fortress of Doom. Now go beat Lufia 2!

take them to the Dragon Shrine which is located in the southern desert west of 
Herat. The Dragon will then give you 4 options. You can either raise everyone's 
level up by 2, Get the Might Shield, Get the Might Bow, or have the Dragon use 3 
of every kind of Potion on everyone in your team. (Mind Potion, Great Potion, 
etc...) I always choose to have my guys leveled up by 2.
