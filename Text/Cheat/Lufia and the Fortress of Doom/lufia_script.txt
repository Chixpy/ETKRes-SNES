3. Prologue ****************************************************************** 
******************************************************************************
Without warning,
the island suddenly
appeared in the sky.

Four foul and wicked
beings claimed it for
themselves.

They possessed the
frightening powers of
Chaos, Destruction,
Terror, and Death.

The people were horrified.
They called the evil ones
"Sinistrals".

The reign of Terror
continued.

The world massed its
warriors to battle
their dark foes.

But the Sinistrals
were all powerful.

In desperation, the people
called on their bravest
fighters: Artea, Guy,
Maxim, and Selan.

And so began
the final battle...

******************************************************************************
4. Island Fortress ***********************************************************
******************************************************************************
?????: It's so dark.

?????: I feel the energy.

?????: A very dark energy.
       Beware! It's powerful.

?????: Selan. Light Magic.

Selan: As you wish.

Maxim: Is this the Fortress
       of Doom?

Selan: So cold! It freezes
       straight to the heart.

Daos:  Welcome Maxim.

Maxim: Daos? It's you, isn't it?       
       Show yourself!

Daos:  Approach. My chamber is 
       above. I await you.

When you reach a clear bridge at the top of the dungeon.

Daos:  You may cross.

Selan: Maxim. It could be a trap.

Maxim: He said cross let's go.

Selan: But....

Maxim: Daos is testing us. He
       senses our feelings.
       Don't show and fear!

Guy:   You're right. That's
       what he's doing.

Artea: My power is strong.
       The hopes of my people
       energize me.

Maxim: Come on, Selan. We're
       the world's last and
       only chance!

Selan: I know.

Maxim: There's still hope as
       long as Dual Blade keeps
       it's light.

Selan: Dual Blade boosts our
       powers. It makes us even
       stronger in the center of
       this darkness.

Maxim: We will destroy the
       Sinistrals and restore
       peace to the world.
       This we promise.

Selan: We promise. Together!

After all four cross the bridge.

Daos:  Ha, ha, ha!
       I sense your hope.
       Indeed, it is powerful.

Selan: Sinistrals! Your reign of
       tyranny is over! Do you
       hear me? We will finish
       you once and for all!

Daos:  The woman's energy flows
       strangely. Is this human
       love? Such a thing is
       unknown to us.
       No Matter. It is easily
       smashed.

After you reach Daos and the three other Sinistrals.

Daos:  Maxim! At last we meet.
       I sense your strength.
       A worthy opponent.

Maxim: Daos! With Dual Blade I
       Return the pain you gave
       to my people!

Gades: Hold, Maxim! You shall
       fight me first!

After defeating Gades.

Amon:  You will go no further!

After defeating Amon.

Erim:  Maxim is it? Come!
       Come and join your fallen
       friends!

After defeating Erim.

Daos:  Magnificent! A true fighter.
       'Tis truly a pity I must
       destroy you.

After defeating Daos.

Maxim: Daos. This is the end.

Daos:  Indeed. This shall be
       the end......OF EVERYTHING!

Artea: The Sinistrals are
       gathering their energy
       into one flow! They're
       merging!

Guy:   They want to destroy us!

Artea: Not only us. If that flow
       erupts, the world will
       cease to exist!

Guy:   What?

Maxim: I won't let that happen!
       I can't do it alone.
       Artea. Guy. Selan. Join me.
       Merge your flows with mine!

Selan: Maxim! It's too dangerous!

Maxim: Quickly. We don't have
       time. Do it......NOW!

Daos:  Ha, ha, ha! Fools! Our
       dark powers are vast.
       Your feeble efforts are
       no match against us!

Maxim: Give it all you've got!

Artea: Maxim! Selan can't take
       much more of this!

Selan: I'm......I'm fine.
       Everyone! Concentrate!

Daos:  AARGH! You filthy pests!

Maxim: Ready!
       
Maxim: We did it.
       Guy? Are you alright?

Guy:   They'd have to do more than
       that to stop me!

Maxim: Artea!

Artea: I'm fine.

Maxim: Selan!

Selan: We....finally did it, Maxim.

Maxim: Selan? What's the matter?

Selan: We finally restored peace
       to the world.

Maxim: Yes. We did.
       Let's go home.

Selan: No. I'm not going home.

Maxim: Selan! What are you
       saying?

Selan: The eruption went through
       me. I can't....even....speak....

Maxim: No! Selan! Selan!

Selan: I....wish I could....stand
       on our....land with you
       once again.
       And hold....my......child......

The bridge collapses separating Maxim and Selan from Guy and Artea.

Guy:   The fortress is breaking
       up! Artea. The warp magic!

Artea: Maxim and Selan are too
       far. I can't take them
       with us!

Guy:   Can't we do anything?

Maxim: Artea! Guy! Don't worry
       about us. Save yourselves!

Artea: Maxim?

Maxim: The Sinistrals are defeated.
       You must tell the people.

Artea: But....!

Maxim: I can't leave he here
       alone! Please understand.

Artea: ........

Guy:   Let's go, Artea!

Artea: Guy! You can't mean...

Guy:   Maxim said we should go.
       He's right. It's the only
       way.

Artea: ........

Guy:   Artea!

Artea: Maxim. The world will know.
       I promise you. Goodbye,
       my friend......
       Warp!

Maxim: Selan. Peace will come.
       I wish we had been born
       in such a world.
       Selan. I love you.
       I'll always love you.

Thus, the battle ended.
The island plummeted into
the depths of the sea.
The Sinistrals vanished
and never returned.
In time, it came to be
remembered as
"The Battle of Doom Island".

        Lufia
& The Fortress of Doom

******************************************************************************
5. Alekia 1 ******************************************************************
******************************************************************************
90 years had passed since
the great conflict.
Once again, peace settled
over the kingdoms.
Life was good,
and troubles were few.
"The Battle of Doom Island"
soon faded from memory.
The people lived and worked
in harmony once more.
That's when the trouble
started....

Roman: Another lazy day.

Hero:  Hello, Roman.

Roman: Oh, Hero. Come for a
       visit, have you?

Hero:  Yes.

Roman: My, you're a mess today!
       Went adventuring again,
       did you?

Hero:  I went to the caves today!

Roman: I wouldn't push my luck
       if I were you. But,
       then again, I haven't seen
       any monsters lately.

Hero:  That's ok. I'm not afraid
       of any monster!

Roman: Hello, young lady.
       Are you all alone?

?????: ........

Roman: You're new around here.
       What's your name?

?????: ........

Roman: Are you lost?
       Is everything alright?

Hero:  My name's Hero.
       What's yours?

Lufia: Lufia. My name is
       Lufia.

Hero:  That's a nice name. Hey,
       Lufia! Where are your
       parents?

Lufia: ........

Hero:  Where do you live?

Lufia: Let's play.

Hero:  Huh?

Lufia: Let's go outside and play!

Hero:  Ok.
       What do you want to do?

Lufia: Tag! I'll run and Hero, 
       you come after me.

Hero:  Alright. I'll count to
       three. Ready? One, two....

Lufia: Whee! Ha, ha, ha!

Hero:  Three! Ready or not!
       Here I come!
Roman: Seems like a nice girl.
       I wonder who she is?

Nine years later....
Hero:  Time for afternoon
       training.

Knight 1: Nobody's coming today,
          anyway. Just another
          day off.

Knight 2: Hey! I have an idea! Jack
          said he was going to chase
          Yuria around the castle
          again. Let's go watch!

Knight 1: This I have to see!

Hero:  I don't believe this.

Knight 3: Lighten up Hero! They're
          just having some fun.
          And that's what peace is
          all about, right? 

Hero:  And what would you do if
       the monsters suddenly
       attacked?

Knight 3: Monsters? get real! There
          haven't been any monsters
         around here for 100 years!

Hero:  Lufia....

Lufia: Why, Hero. Aren't you
       new guys supposed to be
       training today?
Hero:  How'd you know that?
       Then, you also know why
       I'm here.

Lufia: Skipping out again, I
       imagine. The commander
       won't like it if you
       don't practice!

Hero:  I'm not skipping out!
       No one came, so drill
       was cancelled.

Lufia: Oh, I see.

Hero:  How about you, Lufia?
       What are you doing?

Lufia: I found some Priphea
       buds over here. Take
       a look.
       Here.

Hero:  Which ones?       
       Where are they?

Lufia: They're all over the place.
       Look closer.
       Priphea almost never
       bloom. But they're so
       pretty when they do.
Hero:  Always the flower lover.

Lufia: I guess you're right. I
       remember making wreaths
       for you, Hero, when
       we were children.

Hero:  Mmm. You made me
       dizzy with so many
       flowers.

Lufia: Yes. Those were happy
       times, weren't they?

Hero:  Tell me, Lufia. What
       do you think about
       life the way it is today?

Lufia: It's good, I think. We have
       peace and....well, you're
       here.

Hero:  I wonder how long this
       peace will last.
       Life used to be so hard
       100 years ago.

Lufia: Are you thinking about
       the past again?

Hero:  What would we do if the
       Sinistrals returned?
       Maxim is dead. Who would
       defend us?
Lufia: You're a knight of Alekia,
       aren't you? Doesn't Maxim's
       blood run in your veins?       
       Won't that be enough?

Hero:  ........

Lufia: We should be getting home
       soon. I'll make you some
       cinnamon tea. I haven't
       made it for a while.

Hero:  Cinnamon tea.
       One of your recipes that
       actually tastes good.

Lufia: Oh, you! I'll have you
       know that it's very popular
       with our guests.

Hero:  Hmm. That's odd.
       Aren't you using......

Lufia: What?

Hero:  You know. Herbs that
       change the taste of things?
       The stuff people say is
       made by the Lyden Wizard?

Lufia: Well, I never! If that's
       what you think, then I'll
       never let you drink it.

Hero:  Come on, Lufia.
       I'm just kidding, ok?
       Don't be angry. Come on.
       Let's have that cinnamon
       tea. And how about some
       of your cinnamon pie?

Lufia: ........

Hero:  Your cinnamon pie is
       the best in the whole
       world.

Lufia: You have some nerve!
       Well, if you're going to be
       that nice, I'll have to make
       a cinnamon pie, won't I?

The two run to the inn.
Lufia: Roman? I'm going
       to use the oven now.

Roman: Well, what's got into you?
       Going to bake something,
       are we?

Lufia: Cinnamon pie. Lots of
       cinnamon pie. You're
       going to love it!

Roman: Lufia is in a good mood.
       What happened?

Hero:  Nothing. I just said that
       her cinnamon pie was the
       best in the world.
       That's all.

Roman: I see. I see. Well, she
       hardly ever bakes for me
       when I ask her, you know.

Hero:  What? Lufia owes you so
       much. You'd think the least
       she could do for you is
       bake a pie!

Roman: Oh, I don't do that much.
       I'm just an innkeeper.

Hero:  I remember nine years ago.

Roman: Has it been nine years
       already?

Some guy 1: Have you heard? People
            say that monsters attacked
            the Kingdom of Sheran.

Some guy 2: I don't know about that. If
            it were true, why don't the
            knights look into it? That's
            what they're for, right?

Some guy 1: The Kingdom of Sheran won't
            let the Alekian knights
            enter.
            Besides, they're all too
            lazy. No one will go and
            see.

Some guy 2: Isn't that the truth!

Hero runs off.

Lufia: Hero. Go ahead and have
       some tea. The pie will be
       ready soon.
       Hero? Where are you?

Some guy 1: You mean the young man?
            He just left.

Lufia: Really?
       Whatever is he thinking?
       That Hero! I'll never
       forgive him!

Hero:  Monsters is Sheran?
       It can't be true!

When you locate and talk to the commander.

Commander: What?! Monsters attacked
           the Kingdom of sheran?
           I've heard nothing about
           this!

Hero:  It may be a rumor, but we
       should be cautious.       
       Commander, form a detail
       and check it out.

Commander: It isn't that easy.
           We can't just send out
           knights off on a rumor.
           I won't send anyone until
           a scout goes to Sheran.
           When you locate and talk to Yuria.

Yuria: Oh, it's you, Hero. Don't
       tell Jack I'm here. He's
       been chasing me around the
       castle again!

Hero:  Jack is looking for you.

Yuria: What? He's inside?
       Now what will I do?

When you locate and talk to the Princess Estea.

Princess Estea: The Kingdom of Sheran? 
                I know. The rumor
                worried me as well.

Hero:  Princess Estea. Did you
       Know about it?

Princess Estea: I have no authority to
                order the knights. But
                I am worried about
                Sheran. I....

Hero:  Put your mind at ease.
       I was leaving for
       Sheran anyway.

Princess Estea: Really? Good. Our country
                still has a few good men       
                left. Please use this.
                This is all the help
                I can give you.
                (Hero gets 100 gold 
                pieces.)
                I leave Sheran in your
                hands.

Things said by people in Alekia when Hero talks to them:

This is a merchant's shop.

This is a weapons shop.

This is an armorer's shop.

What can I do for you today.

Yes. It's really peaceful.

Lufia was crying.
Whoever made her cry must
be cruel and unfeeling.

Why aren't you with
Lufia? You two are always
together. What happened?
Did you have an argument?

The latest dress designs
are at the biggest shop in
Lorbenia. Why don't you go
there with Lufia?

Roman's cinnamon tea is
the best. I wish I could 
make it, but Roman only
taught Lufia.

Hey. You shouldn't let
such a pretty lady run
away like that!

The Sheran rumor is true?
Well, I don't know.
I've never actually seen
monsters in Sheran.

Roman:
Lufia got mad and left.
That's understandable
when you bake for someone
and he skips out.
Why don't you take a break?

You're an Alekian knight?
You seem strange.

Chatam is north of Alekia.
Be sure to visit their inn!

The way to Sheran lies
through the northern caves,
But beware! Monsters roam
the tunnels.

My husband hates rain!
That's why he uses the
underground path.

When you want to use magic,
select the staff icon with
the cross key and press the
"A" button.
During battle, use the
cross key to choose a spell.
Press the "A"button to
cast it.

Press the "A" button when
in front of the dresser.
Maybe you'll find something.
When you walk around,
touch objects in towns and
villages to find hidden
items. For example you could
look around outside
this room.

Monsters in the Kingdom
of Sheran? The commander
didn't say a word about
that!

Maybe you should ask
the commander first.
He's in the castle.

What? The commander?
Same as always. He's
sleeping in the backroom
on the far left side.

You can't change your
weapon once you're in
battle, so be careful.

Hey, Hero? Have you
seen Yuria? I'm going to
ask her out today!

This castle needs more
help, Hero.
Do you know anyone?

The Princess has been
acting strange lately.
I wonder what's the
matter?

This is the guest room,
but we haven't used it
much lately.

This is the Princess' room.
Not just anyone may enter.
Please leave.

Where did Yuria go?
There's a ton of work
to do!

I'm worried. Our Princess
hasn't eaten much lately.
Is it my cooking?

This is the throne room.
Please behave in front
of His Majesty.

What? The rumor about
monsters in Sheran?
I can't send anyone
until you've checked it.
No matter how many times
you ask, I can't send the
knights until you've checked
to see if the rumor's true.

******************************************************************************
6. Chatam 1 ******************************************************************
******************************************************************************
Thing's said by people in Chatam when Hero talks to them:

Welcome. What can I do
for you?

I know about the Sheran
story. But, I'm not going
to see if it's true!

I haven't seen Danil
recently. His sister, Lilah, 
is a maid at the castle.
I'm very worried about them.

I want to go to the store
in Lorbenia. It might have
things we can't get here.

Monsters in Sheran?
Everyone knows about it,
but nobody wants to find
out.

My friend Kilah works in
Sheran. I'm worried about
her.

******************************************************************************
7. Sheran 1 ******************************************************************
******************************************************************************
When you find and talk to the only person not knocked down in Sheran.

Some guy: Oh no.

Hero:  Are you alright?
       Can you hear me?
       What happened?

Some guy: Something evil attacked us.
          That's why the monsters
          went crazy.

Hero:  Let me take care of you.
       You'll be fine.
 
Some guy: Never mind about me.
          You must go and help
          the others.

Hero:  Sir....?
       Sir!!

When you talk to the guy in the merchant shop.

Some guy: The monsters attacked us.
          Their leader wore a black
          cape.......

Hero:  Be brave!

Some guy: ............


Thing's said by people in Sheran when Hero talks to them:

Go quickly, and return
to Alekia.

Be careful. It's
still here.

You must do something
before Alekia is destroyed.
Go back and inform the
king right now!

It's dangerous here.
Go home! Quickly!

******************************************************************************
8. Alekia 2 ******************************************************************
******************************************************************************
When you talk to Roman at the inn.

Roman: What? Monsters in Sheran,
       you say? Come to think of
       it, we haven't had any
       guests from Sheran lately.

Hero:  By the way, Roman.
       Has Lufia returned?

Roman: She's back, but she shut
       herself in upstairs.
       Still angry, I suppose.
       You should say something.
       Why don't you take a break?

When you talk to Lufia on the second floor of the inn.

Lufia: How could you do that to me?
       I'll never forgive you!
       Never!

Hero:  Please listen. I'm sorry I
       left like that. But, there's
       trouble in Sheran right now.
       I had to go there.

Lufia: You could at least have
       stayed for some pie.

Hero:  You can always make
       cinnamon pie!

Lufia: So, Sheran is more
       important than my pie.
       Is that what you're saying?

Hero:  That's ridiculous!
       You can't possibly
       compare the two.

Lufia: Why, you....! I understand.
       Go away! Leave me alone!

After walking out of the in.

Roman: Hey, Hero.
       You know, Hero.
       Lufia isn't really angry
       because you didn't eat
       the pie.
 
Hero:  I know.

Roman: It's because you went off
       into dangerous territory
       alone. 

Hero:  I know. I know.
       But do you think she       
       would listen to me?

Roman: Sometimes you're so funny.
       There's no need for you to
       go running off to such
       dangerous places.

Hero:  Hmmm. I don't even
       understand it myself.

Roman: Must be that Maxim
       blood in you.

Hero:  Would you take Lufia
       some hot mil later on?
       And please tell her the
       Priphea are in bloom.

Roman: Priphea?

Hero:  Flowers. She was waiting
       for them to bloom.

Roman: Don't push yourself so much.
       Come back here if you get
       hurt. We're always open.

After exiting Alekia.

Lufia: Hero! Wait!

Hero:  What's wrong, Lufia?

Lufia: You're going somewhere
       dangerous again, aren't
       you?

Hero:  Yes.

Lufia: Even if I tell you not to
       go, I know you'll leave
       anyway.

Hero:  You know everything,
       don't you?
       You're right. I'm going.
       I have to go.

Lufia: I won't stop you.
       Take me with you.

Hero:  I can't.

Lufia: I thought you'd say that,
       but I still want to go
       with you.

Hero:  No!

Lufia: Please....I

Hero:  No way!

Lufia: Hero is so stubborn!
       Fine. 
       Even if he says no,
       I'm still going with him.
       I won't take no for an 
       answer. I'm still mad
       at you about the pie!

Hero:  Still angry about that?
       I don't care.
       You want to come? Fine.
       Do as you like.
       Don't blame me if something
       happens.

Lufia: That's alright with me.
       I don't need your help.
       I can take care of
       myself just fine.

Hero:  A brave thing to say. Ha!
       Suit yourself!

Lufia: You don't like me, do you?

Hero:  ............

Lufia: I'm selfish and I have
       a short temper.
       No wonder you're tired
       of me.

Hero:  If that's all it take,
       then I was tired of you
       long ago.

Lufia: ....Hero.

Hero:  Lufia, dangers lie ahead.
       I can protect myself, but I
       don't know if I can protect
       you. Please understand.

Lufia: Well, I don't.

Hero:  Why won't you listen?

Lufia: Whatever the danger ahead,
       I'm not afraid.

Hero:  What are you saying, Lufia?
       I....

Lufia: You'll learn how, I'm sure.
       No matter what happens,
       you'll protect me, won't
       you?

Hero:  Well....yes.

Lufia: Please. Let me go with you.
       I promise I'll do my best!

Hero:  ........

Lufia: ........?

Hero:  You might die.

Lufia: I won't die.

Hero:  How can you say that?

Lufia: Just because. If you're
       with me, I just won't die.

Hero:  You always want it
       your own way, don't you?

Lufia: You figured that out
       just now?

Hero:  I knew it all along.
       Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Lufia: Why are you laughing
       like that, Hero?

Hero:  Because I thought it would
       end up like this!

Lufia: Me, too.

Hero:  Lufia....

Lufia: Promise me Hero, that
       you'll never leave me.

Hero:  I promise.

Lufia: That's all I wanted to hear.

Hero:  Let's go, Lufia.
       We must get to Sheran.

Lufia: Alright.

When you go to the castle and speak to the commander.

Commander: What? Monsters actually
           attacked Sheran? I'll send
          a detail immediately!

Hero:  Good. When will they
       leave?

Commander: First, we'll hold a meeting.
           They'll leave when everyone
           agrees to go.

Hero:  So, when will they go?

Commander: Let's see. The chairman's
           in Lorbenia. I think he
           returns next week.

Hero:  You mean, they won't
       leave until next week?

Commander: Well, the chairman returns
           next week. And then, we'll
           hold a meeting to choose
           the members of the detail.

Hero:  I've heard enough!
       Excuse me!

When you talk to Danil on the floor in the cave on your way to Sheran.

Hero:  Are you alright?
       Pull yourself together!

Danil: I'm fine. Are you a knight?
       My sister Lilah is in
       Sheran Castle.

Hero:  Sister?

Danil: I came here because I
       was worried. Monsters
       attacked me. Please take
       me to Sheran.

Hero:  Listen. You can trust me.
       Go back to the village.
       There's danger ahead.

Danil: I understand. Please
       help Lilah.

Hero:  I'm sure she's fine.

Danil: Thanks. Take this key.
       Lilah used it at the
       castle.
       I'll be fine. Please
       hurry to Sheran.

When you find the King of Sheran.

Lilah: Who's there?

Hero:  Hero, knight from the
       Kingdom of Alekia. I've
       come to help.

Lilah: Knight of Alekia?
       Great! Are you here
       to rescue the King?

Sheran's King:
       What? Only two?
       What are knights of
       Alekia doing in out
       country?

Lilah: Sire! These are dangerous
       times! You should be
       grateful.

Sheran's King:
       I know.

Lufia: Hero. It's amazing that
       someone would scold a king!

Hero:  Probably very important.
       Excuse me. Is Lilah here?

Lilah: I'm Lilah.

Hero:  You're Lilah? Your brother
       asked us to find you.

Lilah: My brother, Danil?

Hero:  He's been worried about
       you. Let's get out of here.
       I'll take you to Alekia.

Lilah: I understand. Thank you.

After exiting the castle.

Gades: Who dares to enter
       my domain?

Lilah: It's him! He's the one
       who destroyed everything!

Gades: Ah! an Alekian knight!
       Yet, you seem different
       from the others...

Hero:  ...Lufia!
       Take everyone and leave.
       You're in great danger!

Lufia: But! But, Hero!

Hero:  Go! Go and get the knights.
       Quickly! Something evil is
       at work here!

Lufia and the others flee leaving Hero behind.

Hero:  Why? Why did you
       destroy so many?

Gades: I need no reason!
       My mission is destruction.
       No more, no less.

Hero:  Destruction?
       Do you think you can
       get away with such an
       evil deed?
Gades: Puny knight!
       I AM EVIL!

Hero:  E....Evil?

Gades: I am Gades! Siniatral of
       Destruction!!

After Gades defeats Hero. Lufia returns.

Gades: You. Woman.
       You!

Lufia: What? Stay away from me!
       I won't let you take Hero!

Gades: ............

Lufia: Go away! Leave us alone!!

Gades: So be it!
       Farewell, woman.
       Until the next time!

Lufia: Are you alright, Hero?

Hero:  Don't worry about me.
       I'm fine, but what about
       the king and the others?

Lufia: Everyone arrived in Alekia.
       They're safe inside the
       castle walls.

Hero:  What about the knights?
       Where are they?

Lufia: They couldn't leave right
       away. So, I returned alone.
       I was so worried about you,
       Hero.

Hero:  Thanks! I wouldn't have
       made it without you!

Lufia: Who was that anyway?

Hero:  I couldn't believe my
       ears, but he called
       himself Gades.

Lufia: Gades?
       The Sinistral Gades?
       I thought he died at
       Doom Island!

Hero:  That's right.
       He was supposed to
       have been defeated.

Lufia: That means....

Hero:  We don't know that.
       If it was Gades, what
       about the other three:
       Amon, Daos, and Erim?

Lufia: I don't want to know!
       Let's return to Alekia.

Hero:  You're right. Let's return
       Lilah to Chatam village.

Roman: Hero

Hero:  Roman

Roman: You're alright, Hero. I
       heard from Lilah and I
       was worried.
Hero:  I'm fine.

Roman: Well, let's head home.
       You challenged Gades,
       didn't you, Hero?

Hero:  Yes.

Roman: What are you going to
       do now?

Hero:  First, I'm going to escort
       Lilah from the castle to
       the village of Chatam.
       And then, I....

Roman: Going off even further?

Hero:  Uh....yes.

Lufia: Hero. Would you
       mind leaving us for
       a moment?

Hero:  I'll wait outside.

Lufia: Roman....I....

Roman: It's alright to go
       with him.

Lufia: What?
Roman: Don't leave Hero. It's
       no accident that you
       met each other.

Lufia: But, I can't leave you
       all alone.

Roman: Don't worry about me.
       I'm sure I'll see you
       again.

Lufia: Roman....

Roman: Go now.

Lufia: I'll be back.

Lufia walks outside to Hero.

Lufia: He said, "Go."

Hero:  I see.

After going to the Castle and speaking to Lilah.

Lilah: I don't know how to thank
       you Hero.

Hero:  It's nothing. I should
       take you to Chatam Village.
       You're brother is waiting.

Lilah: Thank you.

After talking to the Princess in the castle.

Princess: Hero. You've returned
          safely. I heard from the
          King. But, who was it that
          you fought against?

Hero:  You won't believe me,
       but it was Gades.

Princess: Gades? one of the
          Sinistrals from Doom
          Island? How is this
          possible?

Hero:  I must find out if the
       Sinistrals really have
       returned to our world
       again!

Princess: I too, must know. Forgive
          my request, for I fully
          realize the dangers you
          are about to face.

Hero:  I'm prepared for danger.
       And if it is Gades, my
       mission is to destroy him.

Princess: Missions....I see. Yes. You
          are descended from Maxim.
          Good. But be careful.

When you talk to some kid in Chatam.

Kid:   You're lady friend looks
       tough.

Hero:  Do you think so? I'd say
       she's rather gentle.

Kid:   Maybe, But, she still
       looks strong.

Hero:  You shouldn't try to
       fool children.

Lufia: What do you mean
       by that?

Hero:  Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

When you cross the bridge in Chatam.

Lilah: Danil!

Danil: Lilah!

Lilah: Danil!

Danil: Lilah, is it really you?
       I'm so glad you're alright.

Lilah: Danil, oh Danil.

Lufia: Everything is alright
       now. Lilah...

Hero:  What's the matter,
       Lufia?

Lufia: I....I'm just so happy.

Danil: I don't know how to thank
       you for bringing Lilah
       back safely. I....

Hero:  Please. Don't worry
       about it.

Lufia: Just be sure to take
       good care of your sister.

Danil: I give you my word.

Lilah: Hero. It's just a rumor,
       but there's someone in
       Treck who knows about the
       Sinistrals.
       Treck is southwest of
       Sheran. It's far, so be

After speaking with a woman in the Lodge.

Woman: The old fellow at the port  
       said he was a knight. He
       used to be with the Guy
       Legion.

Hero:  The guy who survived the
       Battle of Doom Island?
       That one?

Woman: I....I really don't
       know.

When you talk to some kid at the docks.

Kid:   My father works at the 
       largest shop in Lorbenia.
       What do you think of
       that?

Lufia: Really? That's great!
       Does he bring you lots of
       presents when he comes
       home?

Kid:   Yes! But, he hasn't
       returned yet. I wonder
       what's happened?

When you talk to Former Guy Legion Knight at the docks.

Former Guy Legion Knight: 
       I sense unusual energy
       from you. Did you battle
       a strong enemy lately?

Hero:  How did you know that?

Former Guy Legion Knight:       
       Because I used to be a
       knight with the Guy
       Legion.

Hero:  Guy? you mean the Guy of
       Doom Island?

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Yes. It was a long time
       ago.

Hero:  Did you know anything
       about Gades?

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       So, you know about the
       Sinistral Gades. Pretty
       rare these days for one
       so young!

Hero:  Know him? I fought him!

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Wha....what's that?
       You fought Gades?
       Is this true?

Hero:  Yes.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       If you're telling the truth,
       that explains the imbalance.
       But....Gades was destroyed.

Hero:  Please tell me what you
       know about Gades. I
       must know.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Why such interest in the
       Sinistrals? Don't you
       fear for your life?

Hero:  I am Maxim's descendant.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Maxim? You? Hmm.
       Follow me.

They walk to the house west of the entrance.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Ainea. You there?

Ainea: What is it, uncle? Who's
       that behind you?

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       This is Hero. Show them
       to the East Cave. I want
       him to meet the One.

Ainea: Are you sure? I mean, the
       One said he wouldn't meet
       anybody.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       It's alright. He's a
       descendant of Maxim.
       They must meet.

Ainea: Maxim? Hero, please come
       with me to the East Cave.

Hero:  East Cave?

Ainea: An important person lives
       just beyond the East Cave.
       He often helps me. Please
       come.

Things said by people in Treck when Hero talks to them:

Monsters recently captured
most of the Lorbenia-bound
ships. Shipping has
stopped. It's a pain.

You wish to see me.

Welcome. I've some great
pear cider on hand!
What will it be?

An old man who watches the
sea all day is unusual.
That's what I think!

We've had few customers
lately. The work is easier,
but.... Oh, we'll take your
order downstairs.

We have fine cider in the
basement, but so does
Arubus.

Yo! How's business? As
long as I have my
precious ship Maberia,
business is grand!

New dresses have arrived
at the shop in Lorbenia.
Why don't you get something
for your lady friend?

It's 10 gold pieces a night.
Do you want to stay over?

Take a look at what
we have here!

Please come in. Take
your time and look
around.

Our weapons are the best
on this island. Going on
a voyage? We have
everything you need!

No ships are ready to
set sail for Lorbenia.
Many were attacked by
monsters.

Ships have stopped
coming recently.
Why?

Great ship, isn't she?
That's my Maberia. When
you trade with Lorbenia,
she'll never go wrong!

Our cider is too bitter
for you young folks. But,
I'll sell it to you if
you still want it.

Ainea: No. I'm here for a
       special reason.

Guy:   Who's that behind you?

Ainea: This is Hero, a descendant
       of Maxim.

Hero:  Pleasure to meet you.

Guy:   Descendant of Maxim?       
       Then would you be so
       kind as to focus your
       thoughts?

Hero:  Thoughts?

Guy:   Just think of any one
       thing. That will be enough.

Hero:  Sure.
       ....................

Guy:   Strong energy. Just like
       Maxim's. The very same
       power runs through you,
       too.

Hero:  You know about Maxim?
       Who are you?

Guy:   I am Guy. I fought
       with Maxim against
       the Sinistrals.

Hero:  You're Guy? But....!

Guy:   No need to be surprised. I'm
       over 100 but still kicking!
       Now. What would you want
       with such an old man?

Hero:  Guy. I battled Gades.

Guy:   Gades? But......
       That's not possible!
       He lost at Doom Island!

Hero:  But it was Gades.

Guy:   Impossible! Absolutely
       out of the question!

Lufia: Guy. Hero isn't one
       to lie.

Guy:   Hmmm? Who is that?

Hero:  This is Lufia, a
       childhood friend. We're
       traveling together.

Lufia: How do you do?

Guy:   Lufia, eh? Hmmm.
Lufia: ......?

Hero:  If you know anything of
       Gades and the Sinistrals,
       please tell me.

Guy:   It hurts to recall. But, if
       Gades has really returned,
       there's no time to rest.
       Not even for me!

Ainea: You can't, Guy. You'll
       hurt yourself!

Guy:   But I can't just sit still.
       I....I can......ugh!!

Ainea: Guy! What's wrong?

Guy:   It's my time. It's....

Ainea: Don't say that. You'll
       be fine.

Guy:   Hero. Seek Artea, the elf.
       They live a long time. I'm
       sure he'll help you.

Hero:  Is Artea alive, too?
       Where can I find him?

Guy:   There's one in Grenoble
       who knows about Artea.
       Remember....find....Artea...
Hero:  I understand. I'll look
       for him.

Guy:   Don't give in to the
       Sinistrals. You mustn't!
       You have Maxim's blood....
       You....

Ainea: Guy! Guy! No!

After Guy dies and the they bury him.

Ainea: A great warrior, Guy. May
       he rest in peace. We'll
       never forget you.
       What will you do now?

Hero:  We'll go to Grenoble.
       Someone there knows
       about Artea.

Ainea: Well, be careful. I'll look
       forward to the day when
       peace comes to this land.
Hero:  Guy. I will defeat the
       Sinistrals. I promise.
       Rest. Rest peacefully.
       Let's go, Lufia.

Lufia: Ok.

Hero walks away.

Ainea: Lufia.
       It may be that the only
       one who can defeat the
       Sinistrals is one who
       has Maxim's blood.

Lufia: Yes. I know.

Ainea: Stay close to Hero. Your
       support is more important
       than any sword or armor!

Lufia: I won't let Hero get
       hurt, no matter what.
       I....

       Artea. That's where we'll

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Grenoble is southwest of
       Lorbenia. We used to sail
       there, but not anymore.

Hero:  Anyway, we won't get
       anything done unless
       we go to Lorbenia.

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       Some soldiers from Lorbenia
       are here. They're asking
       about the Four Sinistrals.
       How about meeting them?

When you go to the dock and speak to Aguro.

Aguro: I am Aguro, commander of
       the Lorbenian Army. I came
       when I heard that Gades
       invaded Sheran.
       Can you tell me anything?

Hero:  You want to know about
       Gades?

Aguro: And you as well, I see.
       Do you know anything?

Hero:  You may not believe me,
       but I fought him.

Aguro: What! Is this true?
       Who are you? What's your
       name?

Hero:  I am Hero, knight of
       Alekia.

Aguro: Hero. Tell me more of
       your battle. Let's dine
       together at my camp.
       You will be my guest.

A ship with four Demon Lords on it docks.

Aguro: Wha....what!

Hero:  Monsters!
       Monsters everywhere!

Aguro: How interesting! We'll
       talk later, Hero. Come
       on! Let's get them all!

After defeating the four Demon Lords.

Aguro: Never before have I seen
       such swordsmanship!

Lufia: Of course. Hero is a
       descendant of Maxim.

Aguro: Descendant of Maxim? So,
       you were destined to meet
       Gades. Most people flee
       when they hear that name.

Hero:  If Gades and the Sinistrals
       have returned, my quest is
       to destroy them.

Aguro: I see. By the way, Hero,
       what are your plans now?

Hero:  I'm off to Grenoble. It
       seems someone there knows
       about Artea.

Aguro: Grenoble is southwest of
       Lorbenia, I believe. I've
       been there. You can use my
       ship to cross the sea.

Hero:  Really? I'd appreciate
       that.

Aguro: Hey! No problem. Trust me.

Some guy in the Lorbenian Army:
       Commander. The sh....ship
       was sunk by...,by
       monsters.

Aguro: What!!

Some guy in the Lorbenian Army:
       This town has no more
       ships.

Aguro: Hmm. So, Hero. First,
       let's find a ship.

Lufia: Will it be alright?
       Can we trust him?

When you reach the Maberia.

Hero:  This must be the Maberia.

Lufia: Hero! Behind you!

Three Goblins run up from behind your party.

After defeating the Goblins.

Hero:  They're the ones who stole
       the Maberia!

Lufia: Hero. Let's board the ship
       and sail to Treck.

Hero:  Good idea.

******************************************************************************

When you talk to the Maberia's Captain.

Captain: Found my Maberia? Where?
        The port? Right! Of course.
        Let's go!

Your party and the Captain walk to the Maberia.

Captain: My Maberia! Thank you!
         Anytime you want to go
         to Lorbenia, you ride free.
         That's my thanks to you.

******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************
After you arrive at Lorbenia.

Aguro: I'll return to headquarters
       to officially request the
       dispatch of the Lorbenian
       Army. And you, Hero?

Hero:  Well, first......

Lufia: We're in Lorbenia now.
       I'd love to see those new
       dresses at the big shop.
       can we go, Hero?

Hero:  I knew you'd say that!
       Alright. I'll hand around
       here a little longer.

Aguro: I'll come to the inn later.
       I have many questions to
       ask you.

When you talk to some girl at the Docks.

Girl:  My boyfriend is a sailor.
       He was on the ship that
       left today.

Lufia: Sailors are wonderful.
       They're so cool!

Girl:  I love listening to his
       tales of adventure.

When you talk to the Toymaker.

Toymaker: Hi. We sell stuffed animals.

Lufia: So many cute animals.
       Did you make them
       yourself?

Toymaker: Yes. I made all the
          animals here.

Lufia: Isn't that something?
       They're all so cute.
       Especially that cat. I
       love that.

Toymaker: Oh, I'm sorry. This one
          isn't for sale. It's for
          my daughter. But I'll
          discount the other ones.

When you enter the Dress Shop.

Lufia: Wow!!
       Look at all these dresses!
       Oh, Hero! What do you
       think about this one?

Hero:  Well, it's fine, I guess.
       It's pretty, too. It must
       be pricey!

Lufia: Oh, I love this one!
       Don't you think it's
       perfect, Hero?

Hero:  Give me a break! How much?
       5,800 gold pieces?! That's
       crazy! You can buy plated
       mail for that!

Lufia: I know. I know.
       It's expensive.

After speaking to a woman who works in the Dress Shop.

Woman: We're having a sale today!
       Buy now before we're 
       sold out!

Lufia: Sale! Hero, I'm going 
       to check it out.

Some kid steals Lufia's gold and runs off.

Thief: Piece of cake!
       Let's see. What do I have
       Today?

Hero catches the thief.

Hero:  Hey!

Thief: What? Who are you?

Hero:  Give me the gold you
       took from Lufia.

Thief: Wha...what are you talking
       about? Are you calling me
       a thief?

Hero:  Don't lie to me.
       I saw you!

Thief: ............

Hero:  Don't try to run away.

Thief: Darn it! I haven't done
       anything!

Lufia comes.

Lufia: Hero? Here you are.
       What? Who is this child?
       What's going on?

Hero:  Lufia. Do you have
       the gold?

Lufia: What? Money? No, I don't!
       Did he...?

Hero:  Mmm. What should we do
       with him? Let's see. The
       army!

Lufia: Wait, Hero. He's just a 
       child. We have the money.
       Let him go.

Hero:  But....!

Lufia: It's alright.
       Boy. Don't you ever do
       this again. Can you
       promise me that?

Thief: Yes! I promise.

Lufia: Good. You can go now.

Hero:  You're too kind, Lufia.

Lufia: It's just that I know
       he has some reason
       to steal.

When you speak to the innkeeper.

Inkeeper: Hello. Were you having
          problems with Lou at
          the big shop?

Lufia: You know about him,
       do you?

Inkeeper: Everyone around here knows
          about him. His name's Lou
          Shaia. He's the son of
          Professor Raile Shaia.

Hero:  Professor Raile Shaia?
       Who's that?

Inkeeper: He's studying something
          weird. I heard he's
          traveling around the world
          to find whatever it is.

Lufia: Then, why doesn't he
       take Lou with him?

Inkeeper: There are so many
          dangerous places out
          there. He decided to
          leave his son at home.

Hero:  But why does Lou steal?

Inkeeper: I hear that Raile Shaia's
          research doesn't pay very
          well. I guess he doesn't
          pay Lou well, either.

Lufia: Some father!

Inkeeper: For that reason, people
          in this town sort of
          ignore what Lou steals.

Lufia: So that was it. Now I
       understand.

Inkeeper: Oops. I took too long.
          So. 20 gold pieces. Are
          you staying?

As you exit the inn.

Hero:  Aguro.

Aguro: Oh, it's you, Hero.
       I was coming to visit
       you.
       Hero. You're going ahead
       with your journey to
       destroy the Sinistrals. 
       Am I correct?

Hero:  Yes. The Sinistrals are
       evil. If they have returned,
       then I must defeat them.

Aguro: I see. Then, I'm coming
       with you.

Hero:  What? Will you really
       join us, Aguro?

Aguro: What do you mean? Am
       I not worthy enough for
       you?

Hero:  Don't be ridiculous! Of
       course you are. But, if
       you come with me, won't
       the army suffer?

Aguro: I asked the army to battle
       the Sinistrals. No interest
       at all. I can't stay there
       any more.

Hero:  All armies are the same.

Aguro: Well, Hero? Where are
       we off to first?

Hero:  Grenoble. Someone is there
       who knows about Artea.

Aguro: Grenoble is in the
       southwest. Let's get going!



Things said by people in Lorbenia when Hero talks to them:

The streets turn empty
when there's a sale.
Everyone goes shopping!

My ship departed.
She's heading for port.
I don't know when she'll
return!

This is the headquarters
of the Lorbenian Army.
Sorry. Non-authorized
personnel cannot enter.

What can I do for you today?

An items shop just opened
near here. That will kill
my business. I'll have to
find something new.

Hello. Sharpness makes
the weapon! You'll find
none sharper than ours.

Light weight and ease
of movement make our
armor the best around.

We have things the shop
next door doesn't have.
Take your time and look
around.

Power Gourd temporarily
boosts your power. Great
against strong enemies, but
it weakens as you fight.

New dresses are on the
third floor. If you're
taking the lady behind
you, please be prepared!

My brother wants
everything he sees!

This is cool, Sis!
Please buy it for me!

Hello. We sell accessories.
How about a present for
your lady friend?

Gee, everything looks so
wonderful! I can't make
up my mind!

I want the biggest teddy
bear in the stuffed
animal shop.

My girlfriend asked me to 
come with her. I've been
here all morning! I'm
exhausted!

Hey! I found this dress!

We'd better choose fast
before everything is sold
out!

When you talk to some guy near the entrance.

Hero:  Excuse me. I heard someone
       here knows about Artea. Do
       you know who that might
       be?

Some guy: Well, I don't know. But
          the old man in the Spring
          Basement might know.

When you talk to a Knight in the treasure hunters shop.

Knight: I found some great treasure
        today. How about you?

Hero:  What kind of shop is
       this anyway?

Knight: What? You didn't know and
        still came? This shop
        takes treasures found in
        the Old Cave.

When you talk to a Knight in the treasure hunters shop.

Old man: You're new here. I've been
         living like this for 40
         years. I'm a pro. Keep your
         hands off, understand?

Hero:  Excuse me. Do you know
       someone called Artea?
       
Old man: Artea? Oh, you mean the
         elf who fought at the
         Battle of Doom Island!
         I've heard of him....

Hero:  You know him? Pease
       tell me more.

Old man: You don't understand how
         the game is played. When
         you ask for something,
         you have to....you know....

Hero:  I have a little money, if
       that's what you mean. But....

Old man: Not money. What I want is
         the "Fairy Kiss" treasure
         at the 2nd level of the Old
         Cave.
         Only a woman can reach
         the "Fairy Kiss". There's
         no way I can get it.


Things said by people in Grenoble when Hero talks to them:

The monsters in the Old
Cave are powerful. You
must use strong weapons
against them.

It's 40 gold pieces a night.
Do you want to stay over?

When walking in the toxic
marsh, sometimes you hit
things you can't see. These
may be hidden treasures.

Inside the Old Cave is a
fabulous treasure that
only women can find.
You could be rich.

My husband hasn't returned 
from the Old Cave yet.
I don't know what I'll do if
something's happened to him!

What can I do for you today?

Be strong if you choose
to enter the Old Cave.

Take a Smoke Ball when you
enter the Old Cave. You can 
avoid monsters with it.

I've been to the Old Cave
many times but I've never
reached the bottom. How
far down can it go?

I'm going to be a treasure
hunter when I get older.

Sorry, but you can't
pass here.

Do you know the power of
the ring? The Flash Ring
increases the power of
Flash magic.
There are many kinds of
rings. You must use them
as each situation demands.
You can't find many rings
in the shops. They're
usually inside treasure
chests.

Have you heard the rumor,
too? I'll let you pass for
50 gold pieces. Will you
pay?

The Old Cave holds many
treasure. Of course, much
has been stolen. Most of
what's left is worthless.

You don't look anything
like a treasure hunter!
That's ok. Try to find
something valuable!

Here you get a task suited
to your level. You get a
new task for every 5 levels
of experience you reach.

Old man: Ok. Ok. Artea, right? See
         the man in the tower
         northwest of town.

Hero:  Northwest Tower. Got it!

Old man: He's a strange one. Won't
         meet anybody unless they
         show him this letter from

Apprentice: A letter? Show it to me.
            Oh! From my friend in
            Grenoble. He helped me
            a lot when I was young.

Hero:  Uh....

Apprentice: Ah, yes. You want to
            ask about Artea.

Hero:  Do you know him?

Apprentice: I do. But, I can't tell
            you anything.

Hero:  Why not?

Apprentice: You may be someone
            important. But, I can't
            tell you where Artea
            lives.

Hero:  Well, then. How can I
       make you tell me?

Apprentice: We shall battle each other.
            One-on-one. For real. Are
            you truly brave enough to
            accept my challenge?

After defeating Apprentice.

Apprentice: You are a good person.
            I can tell by your energy.

Hero:  You'll tell me?

Apprentice: Artea is in Elfrea now.

Hero:  Elfrea?

Apprentice: The village of elves.
            Humans may not enter. You
            will not find him without
            an elf helper.
 
Hero:  So, where's Elfrea?

Apprentice: Go south and cross the
            desert. You'll find a small
            island surrounded by three
            islands. That's Elfrea.
            Listen. Elfrea is far away.
            You'll have to travel
            through three towns to get
            there.

Hero:  I understand. Thanks for
       all your help.

       ever worked for me.

Mark:  You'll be fine. Our town
       has a ruby, the "Hope Ruby".
       It makes your wishes come
       true. I'll bring it here.

Reyna: I know of it. But I thought
       it was a treasure of the
       Kingdom of Medan.

Mark:  I'm sure I can borrow it
       if I ask. Next time I come,
       I'll bring the "Hope Ruby".

Reyna: Thank you, Mark.

Mark:  I'll go back to Medan.

Reyna: Yes. He lives in the

Lufia: He's so sweet.

Reyna: I know. But I wonder

Lufia: What's the matter? You

Mark:  I asked the King to lend

When you walk up to the hope ruby.

Lufia: Hero. I'm going to go

       Ask me what I wished for.

Hero:  What did you wish for?

Lufia: Hee, hee! I won't tell.

When you find the Princess and a Knight on the bottom floor.

Knight: Princess. You shouldn't be

Princess: You've been collecting all
          the coins thrown into the
          fountain again, haven't 
          you?

Knight: Well? That's my job.

Princess: It's sad. We call it the
          "Hope Ruby", but I know
          it's just made of glass.

Knight: But the coins thrown into
        the springs are what our
        country needs.

Princess: I know. That's why it's sad.
          We can't defend the ruby
          forever. Our country must
          wake up someday.

Knight: Princess....

Princess: I wish the ruby was
          broken!

When you exit the castle.

Mark runs by.

Lufia: Wasn't that Mark?

       forgive us.

Lufia: Apologize to the princess,
       Mark. She'll understand,
       won't she Hero?

Hero:  Of course she will.
       Right, Aguro?

Aguro: Maybe she'll reward
       you instead! Ha, ha, ha!

Mark:  ......?

Hero:  Let's return to Kirof.

******************************************************************************

Lufia: Mark. Reyna. Take care
       of yourselves.

Reyna: Are you leaving us
       already?

Lufia: Yes. We have to find a
       village called Elfrea.

Mark:  I thought you couldn't
       get to Elfrea without
       an elf in your party!

Lufia: Do you know anything
       about this, Mark?

Mark:  I don't know where
       Elfrea is, but there
       are elves in Belgen.

Lufia: Belgen?

Mark:  Belgan is a village
       southeast of Medan. My
       father went there. He said
       an elf woman lives there.
       It was the first time my
       father ever saw an elf.
       He was so excited. He
       told me the story later.

28. Medan 2 ******************************************************************
******************************************************************************
After entering Medan.

Princess: I have something very
          important to tell everyone
          today.
          The "Hope Ruby" that was
          stolen the other day is
          made of glass.

Some guy 1: Great! So the real one is
            hidden somewhere, right?

Princess: The glass ruby was
          the only one in Medan.   

Some guy 1: What?

Some guy 2: Are you saying there
            was no "Hope Ruby"
            in the first place?

Some guy 1: That can't be true!

Some guy 2: My wish came true
            once, you know.

Some guy 3: But, why would anyone
            make a fake ruby?

Princess: Medan was rich in gemstone
          mines. But they ran out
          years ago.
          When the gemstones ran
          out, the people of Medan
          survived through tourism.
          And that's why we had
          the "Hope Ruby".
          But this is fraud! It's
          wrong to attract tourists
          to see a fake ruby.
          I really want to make
          Medan rich country.
          To do that, everyone
          must pitch in.

Some guy 1: ........

Some guy 2: ........

Princess: We're sorry for fooling
          everyone. Please find a
          way to forgive my father
          and I for this.

Some guy 1: Princess! Princess!
            Please don't bow to us!

Some guy 3: We, too, completely
            depended on the ruby.
            We failed you.

Some guy 2: We were wrong, too.

Princess: Oh! I....

Some guy 1: It's alright. This country
            will survive without
            the ruby.

Some guy 3: If we really try, we
            can make a country
            equal to Lorbenia!
            I think you're right.
            Let's do the best we can!

Lufia: Medan will survive,
       I think.

Hero:  Thanks to Mark, perhaps.

Aguro: Yes. That boy did it.

After entering Belgen.

Guard: What? Who are you?

Some guy:
       What is it? Are the
       monsters coming?

Guard: No. Humans!

Lufia: Hey! Some way to treat
       travelers! Is that the
       way of this village?

Guard: No! No! Of course not!

Some guy: The monsters attacked us
          recently. People are a
          bit tense, you see.

Guard: Forgive us. Please
       come in.

After talking to some girl.

Some girl: Monsters started attacking
           the village again. That's
           why we offered them a 
           ransom for Jerin.

Lufia: What? Ransoming? I can't
       believe there's a village
       that still does that!
 
Aguro: Me, too. I thought
       offering ransoms
       was just a story.

Lufia: How can you do such
       a thing?

At the Altar in Dais.

Lufia: Hero. Look!
       Isn't that Jerin? She's
       still a child!

Aguro: Not really. Look at
       her carefully.

Lufia: ....?

Aguro: She's half elf! The blood
       of elves and humans mixed.
       I've heard of this, but
       never seen it, until now.

Hero:  If she's half elf, you
       can't tell her age by
       looking, can you?

Lufia: Her age doesn't matter now.
       What should we do, Hero?

Hero:  Well, we can't leave
       things like this.

Lufia: Let's get these two in
       front of the stairs.
       That's how we can help
       her!

Hero:  That's easy, but they'll
       just kidnap someone else.

Aguro: We have to stop this
       kidnapping nonsense
       once and for all!

When you try to exit Dais.

Jerin: Aaaah!

A monster picks Jerin up and flies away.

Lufia: Hero! Jerin!

Hero:  OH NO!

When we reach Jerin and the monster (Follower) on the roof.

Follower: Amon will be revived!
          This daughter will be
          our key! No one can
          stop us now!

Hero:  Did you say Amon?

Lufia: Amon? The Sinistral of
       Terror? No! It's not
       possible!

Follower: You know of Amon? That's
          splendid! Now you shall
          help us as well!

After defeating follower and speaking to Jerin.

Jerin: I'm so happy somebody
       saved me!

Lufia: Kidnapping! Hmph.
       I won't stand still
       for such nonsense!

Hero:  In any case, no one was
       hurt. Can you stand up?

Jerin: Yes. I'm fine.

Hero:  I'll take you as far
       as the village.

Everybody back in Belgen.

Hero:  Well, Jerin. We have to

       farewell.

Jerin: What?

Aguro: Enjoy the village's
       hospitality.

Lufia: Take care now, Jerin.

Jerin: Excuse....excuse me. Please,
       if you don't mind: take 
       me with you.

Hero:  It's dangerous where
       we're going. We really
       can't take you with us.

Jerin: I'll be in your way,
       won't I?

Hero:  I didn't say that. We
       saved your life. I'd
       hate to see you lose it.

Jerin: You're right.
       Life is precious,
       isn't it?

Hero:  That's right. Well,
       it's time to go.

Jerin: Wait! Wait a second!
       Please take this. Just
       to show my appreciation.
(Jerin gives him a miracle)
       Will....will I see you
       again someday?

Hero:  I can't promise. But,
       yes, you will.

Jerin: I know. We'll meet
       again...someday.

After speaking to the old man and answering yes to his question.

Old man: The "Lost Forest" is just
         ahead. But, you'll never
         get through without a
         guide.

Hero:  Is there someone who
       can show us the way?

Old man: Well, yes. But, she's only
         a child. Do you still want
         to go?

Hero:  Yes.

Old man: Alright! You can come out
         now!

Jerin: Hello, Hero.

Hero:  Jer...Jerin!

Jerin: I knew you'd have to
       come this way if you
       were continuing your
       journey.

Hero:  Hey, old man! This child
       won't do. Isn't there
       anyone else?

Old man: She's the only one.

Lufia: Hero, let's try it
       without her. We might
       be able to find the way
       through by ourselves!

Jerin: Only elves know the way
       through the forest.

Lufia: You're not an elf!

Jerin: I'm half elf, so I know
       the way. But for you,
       it's not possible.

Lufia: ........

Aguro: What do you say, Hero?

Hero:  What choice is there?
       We know no other elves.

Jerin: So, you'll let me join
       your party?

Hero:  It's so dangerous! Why do
       you want to come with us?

Jerin: You saved my life.
       I want to help you,
       Hero. I......

Hero:  I understand. Lead on,
       Miss Jerin.

Jerin: Just Jerin, please.

Hero:  Right. Let's go, Jerin.

Jerin: Yay!

Lufia: Hero? Wait a moment!

Aguro: Calm down, Lufia.
       She's just a child.

Lufia: You can't tell with half
       elves. And besides, I am
       calm!

Aguro: Alright...alright.

Lufia: Hero! Are you really
       going to let her join
       our party?

Hero:  There's no one else to
       guide us. We have to
       count on Jerin.

Aguro: I agree.

Lufia: I don't!

Hero:  Why not?

Lufia: Why? Just....well,
       just because. That's
       why!

Hero:  That's not an answer.
       Come on. Let's go.

Jerin: What's wrong with Lufia?

Hero:  She's just jealous. It's
       always the same thing. 
       Nothing to worry about.

Lufia: Hero!!
       I'll go first, Hero!

Jerin: Is she always like this?

Hero:  Yes.

Old Woman: I have some information.
           Will you buy me come cider?
           Do that, and I'll tell you.

Hero:  Yes. 

Old Woman: Ah, you're a bright one!
           Well, I'll have that
           cider now. Ah, how sweet!

Hero:  So, what do you know
       about Elfrea?

Old Woman: In a hurry, eh? You young
           folks can't rush me. How 
           about buying me another
           cider?

Hero:  Yes.

Old Woman: Why, you're getting
           brighter all the time! I
           like that. People should
           be generous.

Hero:  Alright. Now, let's have it.

Old Woman: Hmm. Hmm. To reach Elfrea,
           you have to collect three
           gems: blue, green, and red.

Hero:  Three gems?

Old Woman: There are three islands
           here. Each one has a tower.
           The towers hold the gems.
           Find them, and the way to
           Elfrea will open.
           If you want to find

When you find and speak with the old man.

Old Man: 70 years I've been mining. (I decided to leave this error unfixed.)
         rubies. My whole life has  
         been spent on rubies!

Hero:  Listen, sir. We really
       need rubies. Are you sure
       there are no more here?

Old Man: Why do you need rubies?

Hero:  We need them to meet
       someone called Artea.

Old Man: Artea? The Artea of
         Doom Island?

Hero:  You know about him?

Old Man: Everyone of my generation
         knows about Artea! But why
         do you want to see him?

Hero:  The Sinistrals are about
       to return. We need his
       help to stop them!

Old Man: The Sinistrals? Hmm.
         Wait. I'll give you the
         ruby I've been saving.
         Take this one. It's
         the "Hope Ruby".

Hero:  The "Hope Ruby"? Why....
       why is it here?

Old Man: The Kingdom of Medan
         depended on rubies.
         I thought that Medan would
         die without it. So, I kept
         the real one here.
         Of course, a fake one was
         used after that. Perhaps
         there wasn't a reason to
         keep this one.

Hero:  The fake was destroyed.
       The King of Medan
       finally found out.

Old Man: I see. I'm glad to hear 
         that. Well, this ruby isn't
         necessary. Here. You take
         it.

Hero:  Are you sure?

Old Man: If I could wish on the
         "Hope Ruby", I'd ask that
         the Sinistrals never
         re-appear.
         It's the best I've found
         in 70 years. I want you
         to have it.

            Water Fairy send you?
            I hate intruders!

After defeating Dark Ghost.

Water Fairy: I am the Water Fairy.
            Thanks for removing the
            Dark Ghost. Now I can
            restore the lake again.
            and the toxic marsh
            under this tower will
            also return to it's
            original splendor.
            I really can't thank you
            enough!

After you place the red sapphire on the pedestal.

Jerin: I hear something.

Aguro: I don't hear anything.

Jerin: Only I can hear it. The
       voice of the wind. The
       whisper of Shilf.

Hero:  What do you hear, Jerin?

Jerin: A magical spell. Elfrea's

Artea: Mirka. It's alright.
       Let them pass.

Mirka: Fine. As you wish.

Artea: You came about the
       Sinistrals, didn't you?

Hero:  How did you know that?

Artea: Your energy told me.
       You're related to Maxim,
       are you not?

Hero:  My name's Hero. I am
       a descendant of Maxim.

Artea: I see. I feel the same
       energy from you as Maxim.
       For a moment, I thought
       he was back.

Hero:  You....you're Artea?

Artea: Yes, I am.

Hero:  Artea, the Sinistrals are
       about to return. I must
       have your help.

Artea: I'm sorry, but I can be
       of no help to you.

Hero:  Why not?

Artea: I lost my sight at the
       Battle of Doom Island.
       Besides, I'm old now.

Hero:  Oh, no.

Artea: I'm sorry that I can't
       help you.

Hero:  ........

Artea: I can't help, but perhaps
       the Dual Blade can.

Hero:  Dual Blade? Isn't that the
       sword Maxim used at the
       Battle of Doom Island?

Artea: Exactly. The sword that
       defeated the Sinistrals.
       It's power comes from the
       owner's energy.

Hero:  But I don't have the
       Dual Blade! I don't
       even know where it is!

Artea: It's probably at the bottom
       of the sea with Doom Island.

Hero:  In the sea....?

Artea: You must use the Dual
       Blade to defeat Daos,
       the Chief Sinistral.
       Only one who has the same
       power as Maxim can wield
       the Dual Blade.

Hero:  But what can I do? The
       Dual Blade is at the
       bottom of the sea!

Artea: Do you know Professor
       Raile Shaia?

Lufia: I think we're heard that
       name before, haven't we,
       Hero?

Artea: He's a descendant of Lexis
       Shaia who helped Maxim
       and I a long time ago.
       He's a genius inventor.
       Professor Shaia might know
       a way to travel under the
       sea.
       Odel is south of the small
       Shrine and over the
       mountains. Shaia's lab is in
       the basement of the castle.

Hero:  Alright. I'll go to Odel.

Artea: Hero. You must defeat
       the Sinistrals. We cannot
       relive the nightmare of
       99 years ago.

Hero:  I understand. I swear
       I'll stop them!

Artea: I'll give you this key.
       You should be able to
       reach the small shrine
       from the cellar.
       The rest is up to you.

As you walk away.

Artea: Wait.
       You. Elf child. I have
       something for you.
       Mirka, give her that one.

Mirka: Ok.
       Here. Take this.
(Jerin gets Artea's Bow)

Artea: This is my bow. You have
       elf-blood in you. You'll
       know how to use it.

Jerin: Are you sure I can
       have this?

Artea: How can I help Hero if

Hero:  Lufia opened it.

Old man: Only the most skilled 
         magician is supposed to
         know the spell!
         Lufia, eh? You're very
         experienced, I see.

Lufia: No. Not really.

Old man: You should meet the elder
         in the "Tower of Grief". If
         you're a magician, you can
         learn a lot from him.

When you speak to Flake on the top floor.

Flake: I'm Flake, elder of Arus.
       You fought the Sinistrals.

Hero:  You know about that?

Flake: Feel the energy and
       you'll know right away.
       Hmm. Strong power. I
       sense great ability.

Aguro: You can see through Hero's
       character! People are always
       more than they appear to be.

Jerin: Aguro! Don't be rude!

Flake: Ha, ha, ha! It's alright.
       The truth is always best.
       More importantly, who
       removed the magic barrier
       to the village?

Lufia: I did.

Flake: You must have great skill
       to remove such a barrier.
       Come here.
       Your powers will grow.
       I sense much potential.

Lufia: Really?

Flake: Oh, yes! But you've only
       begun to understand. Let
       me help you. Close your
       eyes.

Lufia: Alright.

Flake: Awake! I call upon
       those powers yet
       untouched. Come forth!
(Lufia's maximum MP
 increases by 10.)

Hero:  Wow!

Aguro: The magic increased
       merely by those simple
       words!

Flake: It's not my power. She's
       always had it. I simply
       drew it out.

Lufia: I had no idea it was
       there.

Flake: You learned through battle.
       That's the hard way. Had
       you studied, you'd have
       discovered it earlier.

Lufia: I can't thank you enough.

Flake: I sense a great imbalance.
       I fear we may see the
       return of Daos and the
       Sinistrals.

Hero:  We're looking for
       Professor Raile. Do you
       know him?

Flake: He returned to the lab.
       You just missed him.

When you speak to Professor Raile in Shaia Lab 1.

Raile: Hey! Don't touch anything
       without asking.
       The other day, a man
       touched a machine that
       turns people into frogs.
       That was a tough one!

Jerin: What....what happened
       to him?

Raile: Too bad, that. I made a 
       new frog-to-people machine.
       But, he came back as a
       snake instead. Hmm.

Jerin: Snake?

Raile: Then, he became a lizard.
       Then, an iguana. Some people
       are just unlucky, I guess.

Jerin: Did he ever return to
       normal?

Raile: Oh, yes. After 3 days,
       he said, "I never want to
       see a lizard's face as long
       as I live!" Ha, ha, ha!

Jerin: I feel sorry for him.

Raile: Excuse me. Who are you,
       anyway? You don't look
       like my lab students.

Hero:  I'm Hero. These are my
       friends: Aguro, Jerin,
       and Lufia.

Lufia: We're looking for Raile
       Shaia. Would that be you?

Raile: Yes, it would. I am the
       genius Raile Shaia. Why
       the face? You don't
       believe me, is that it?

Hero:  No....no. Of course not, but....

Raile: Alright. I'll prove it to
       you. You look like fighters.
       Wait right here.
       How about this tonic?
       With this, you'll have four
       arms! Be twice as strong!

Hero:  Well, no. I don't think
       so.

Raile: No? I've already run
       experiments on this, so
       the effects are
       guaranteed!

Aguro: You did? On who?

Raile: Let's see. You're Jerin,
       right? For you....
       This is perfect. It's
       guaranteed to make your
       hair grow!

Jerin: Really? Well, maybe I
       could try....

Lufia: Don't you dare!

Jerin: I see. You won't like it
       if my hair looks better
       than yours! Ha, ha, ha!

Lufia: Even if you try it,
       my hair will still be
       longer. Isn't that right,
       Hero?

Hero:  Well, I wouldn't know.
       I've never really
       thought about it.

Lufia: Can't you tell?
       Where are your eyes,
       anyway?

Hero:  I'm not always looking
       at your hair!

Aguro: Hey, Hero. Lufia.
       What are you two
       talking about?

Hero:  Right. We're not here to
       talk about hair.
       We're here for a ship
       that goes under the sea.

Raile: Oh! You mean Falcon. One 
       of my best inventions!

Hero:  And Falcon can really
       travel underwater?

Raile: Not only that! It can
       fly through the air!

Hero:  Wow! Where is it?

Raile: It's docked in the
       basement. I normally don't
       show it to anyone. However,
       I'll let you see it.

Raile leads everyone down to the bottom floor.

Raile: Just a second. I'll open
       the door.
       This is Falcon! Isn't she
       amazing?

Jerin: Hero. This ship is
       covered with dust!

Lufia: And the wings are a
       little chipped.

Aguro: Hmm. There's a hole in
       the ceiling.

Hero:  Sorry to ask, but you've
       never used Falcon before,
       have you?

Raile: How did you know that?

Lufia: Well, anyone could tell
       just by looking at it.

Raile: Well, if that's all you
       have to say, I'll give
       you a demonstration.

Hero:  Right now?

Raile: You wanted to use Falcon,
       didn't you? I'm saying you
       can. Are you having second 
       thoughts?

Hero:  Actually, he's right.

Lufia: Are you seriously getting
       into this thing?

Raile: What are you waiting
       for? Let's go!

Hero:  Come on! We need this
       ship to find the Dual
       Blade.

They all board the ship.

Raile: Everyone ready?
       Ahead half speed!
       Prepare to dive!

?????: Is this vessel really
       seaworthy?

Raile: What do you take me for?

?????: Hey! It's leaking! Are you
       sure we won't sink?

Raile: We're fine. Pipe down!

?????: I'm getting soaked!

Raile: Prepare to surface!

?????: I think traveling above
       the sea was a better idea!

Raile: Will you be quiet? You
       amateurs know nothing!

The ship docks back at Shai lab.

Raile: There's a slight problem.
       Underwater navigation is
       impossible. There's no
       problem on the surface,
       though.

Hero:  ........

Raile: Of course, I can repair it.
       But my equipment isn't here.
       Come to Shaia Lab 3 later.
       Straight west from here.

Lufia: He ran away, didn't he?

Hero:  I guess so.

Aguro: He just wanted to leave
       us with this contraption,
       didn't he?

Hero:  He's different. That's
       for sure!

Jerin: But somehow, I like him.

Lufia: ......

Aguro: ......

Hero:  He doesn't seem so bad.

Aguro: Anyway, we can travel
       across the sea now. Let's
       make good use of it.

Hero:  Let's head for Shaia lab
       3. He said he could
       repair Falcon, right?

       Cooper?

Aguro: You should go and get him 
       yourself!

Hero:  Aguro!
       Sorry, Professor. He's
       really a good fellow. But,
       sometimes he behaves badly.

Jerin: His mind is worse!

Aguro: What?

Jerin: I just told the truth!

Lufia: Listen, you two.
       Don't start here!

Hero:  Professor. You want us to
       bring Cooper back here?

Raile: Yes. Cooper is my right
       hand man. I really need
       him to help me repair
       Falcon.
       He's probably at the
       cleric's hut in Bakku.
       You'll find it if you

Hero:  I'm Hero. Professor

Cooper: Professor Raile needs me?
        Then I have to go. Let's
        move!

Jerin: He's a bit strange, Hero.

Aguro: Probably because he's
       Raile's right hand man.

Cooper: We'll talk later. Luckily,
        I have "Escape". I'm
        always prepared. It'll

Cooper: Sorry for being away so

        I do for you?

Raile: I need you to help me
       repair Falcon. It won't
       travel underwater.

Cooper: I can see that. It's
        not ready yet. We need
        Alumina.

Raile: I though so. Is there
       any left?

Hero:  What's Alumina?

Raile: It's a light metal that
       doesn't rust. Falcon is
       made of Alumina.

Hero:  How much do you need?

Raile: Seven pieces should
       do it.

Hero:  Where can I find it?

Raile: There's a cave in the Fargo
       Islands. In Linze is a man
       named Brant. He knows where

Guardian: Those who interfere have
          no need to know!

After defeating Guardian.

Amon:  I have awakened.

Hero:  Who....who?

Amon:  That mortal was weak. He
       lacked the will to live.
       But I......I have waited a
       long time for this moment.

Hero:  What are you saying?

Amon:  The energy of your battle
       revived me, earlier than I
       expected.

Lufia: Who's there? Show yourself!

Amon:  Is that Lufia? Indeed it
       is! Just as Gades said.

Lufia: How do you know my name?
       What's all this about Gades?

Amon appears.

Amon:  Behold! Amon has returned!

Gades appears.

Gades: We meet again, little
       knight. What's wrong?
       You don't look happy
       to see me! Ha, ha, ha!

Lufia: And why should our
       happiness be any
       concern of yours?

Gades: Unchanged, I see. Always
       wanting to win.

Aguro: What are you waiting for,
       Hero? Here's your chance!
       Destroy them! Now!

Amon:  Foolishness.
       I have no time to toy
       with you. Enough!

Amon knocks everyone down with a blast.

Amon:  The Great Reunion draws
       nigh! Even now, our
       brother Daos awakens!

The two Sinistrals leave.

Hero:  Is everyone alright?

Lufia: Yes.

Jerin: I'm fine.

Aguro: Hero!
       Were those really the
       Sinistrals Amon and Gades?

Hero:  Yes.

Aguro: Such power. I felt it
       right away. Can we win,
       Hero?

Hero:  We must. If all of them
       are revived, the world will
       suffer great catastrophe.

Aguro: They said Daos was nearly
       revived, didn't they?

Hero:  I must have the Dual Blade
       before that happens!
       We have to find those 7
       Alumina so Falcon can
       travel underwater!

Lufia: Brant is in Linze. He should

Hero:  Are you Brant?

Clack: No. I'm Clack, the Doom
       Island researcher.

Hero:  Doom Island researcher?

Clack: I'm interested in Doom
       Island. Ask me anything
       about it.

Hero:  I want to know about:
       Doom Island

Clack: East of here is Ring Island.
       It was created when Doom
       Island fell into the sea.
       There's a lagoon in the
       middle of the island. Some
       folks say that the Fortress
       of Doom is at the bottom.

Hero:  In the center of Ring
       Island. I see.

Clack: There are three sea caves
       around Ring Island. They
       lead to the center of
       the lagoon.
       I recently discovered
       something unbelievable
       about Doom Island!

Hero:  What did you discover?

Clank: The ocean currents flow
       near Doom Island. But
       they've changed recently.

Hero:  What caused that?

Clank: Well, it seems that the
       island is starting to move.
       I'm afraid that something
       terrible is about to happen!

Hero:  I want to know about:
       Dual Blade

Clank: The Fortress of Doom should
       hold the Dual Blade.

Hero:  The Fortress of Doom?

Clank: It's where the final battle
       was fought. The Dual Blade
       sank with it into the sea.
       The fortress was supposed
       to have disappeared with
       Doom Island when it fell
       into the center of Ring.

Hero:  I want to know about:
       Brant
       Do you know anything
       about Brant?

Clank: He's my friend. What's
       your business with him?

Hero:  I need Alumina. I heard
       that Brant knows where
       to find some.

Clank: Yes. He'd be the one to
       know. He lived by it.
       Of course he said that
       there's hardly any left
       these days.

Hero:  I heard Brant was here,
       so I came. Do you know
       where he is?

Clank: He told the townspeople
       that? Hmm. Brant's in
       Marse.

Hero:  Is Marse near here?

Clank: His girlfriend lives there.
       It's a secret, you see.
       So, he said he was here.
       Marse is a port north of
       Linze. Follow the shoreline
       by boat and you'll find it.
       If he's not in Marse, he's
       in the caves, looking for
       Alumina.

Hero:  I want to know about:
       Alumina

Clank: There was a lot of it in
       the old days. Now, you can
       only find it in the Fargo
       Islands.
       The Fargo Islands are
       north of here.
       Brant goes there all the
       time.
       There might even be some
       Alumina here, if you
       search this cave well.

When you walk away from Clank.

Clank: By the way, who are you?

Hero:  I'm Hero, descendant
       of Maxim.

Clank: Maxim's descendant?
       No kidding!

Hero:  It's true.

Clank: I have something to give
       you. Follow me.

They follow him.

Clank: Found it long ago. The
       ring Maxim used. This
       might be of great help
       to you.
(Hero gets wave ring.)

Hero:  Can I really have this?
       It's been yours for so
       long!

Clank: Please. Take it. If it helps
       to destroy the Sinistrals,
       then all my research hasn't
       been in vain after all!
       If you really have Maxim's
       blood, you will defeat the
       Sinistrals. I believe it.

Brant: I see. Well, you helped me.

Jerin: Are there any dishes that

Wizard of Taste: 
       Well, there's one....but
       it's not really a dish.

Jerin: What is it?

Wizard of Taste: 
       It's a flavor. A spell has
       been cast on it. That's
       why any food tastes great
       with it.

Jerin: Fantastic!

Wizard of Taste: 
       Don't jump to conclusions
       so quickly. You think the
       dish is good, but that
       doesn't mean it is good.

Aguro: So, you're saying that
       even dishes everyone
       hates would actually
       taste good. Right?

Wizard of Taste: 
       Right.

Lufia: But that's amazing! Why
       did you make such a thing!

Wizard of Taste: 
       It was originally for
       emergencies. You use it
       when there's nothing to
       eat. Like a famine.

Lufia: I see. I guess it has
       some uses.

Wizard of Taste: 
       I sympathize with the
       people. The King's appetite
       was becoming intolerable!

Lufia: Such tastes are expensive,
       aren't they?

Hero:  I don't mind.

       a purple newt.
       I heard I could find one in
       the cave east of Herat. I
       went there myself. But, I
       didn't see any.
       I could finish this if I
       had a purple newt.

When you speak to the Wizard of Taste after getting a purple newt.

Wizard of Taste: 
       That's a purple newt!
       Wait. I'll fix up a dish
       right away!
       Take this. I guarantee that
       it will satisfy King Herat!
(Hero gets the "Magic Flavor".)

When you speak with the Chef in the kitchen.

Chef:  This is the magic flavor
       made by Lyden's "Wizard of
       taste"! Just a minute.
       I'll just whip it up
       right here!
       It's done. Please try it.

Hero:  Mm. Wow! That's good!

Lufia: Yes! Really delicious!

Aguro: Now this is excellent!
       What's the matter, Jerin?
       Don't you want to try it?
       Uh, no. Not right now.

Chef: The King will love this!
      You've been a big help.
      Please see him. I know
      he'll reward you.

Herat: I heard about you from the

When you find Raile locked in a room.

Raile: Hello. Some here I turned
       out to be! Now I'm the one
       who has to be rescued!
       Please find the prison
       key. The head pirate
       should have it.
       You must press four switches
       to open the door. Get the
       order right. I messed up and
       got caught.
       I learned the hard way!
       I'm sure the first switch
       is the upper left one!

When you approach the Pirates on the top floor.

Bosun: Scurvy scum! Come to rescue
       the lad, have ye? Arrr!
       Don't be thinking you'll
       leave here safely!

After defeating the pirates.

Hero:  Good to see you again, Lou.

Lufia: Do you remember us?

Lou:   You....you! Are you still
       chasing me? My stealing
       days are over!

Lufia: Don't be silly. We're
       here to rescue you.

Hero:  What were you doing
       hanging around a place
       like this anyway?

Lou:   Well, you know. I had
       some business to take
       care of.

Lufia: Looking for your father,
       weren't you?

Lou:   No way! I don't care at
       all for someone like......

Lufia: He's here, looking for you.
       But the pirates caught him.

Lou:   Really? Father tried to
       rescue me? Father?

Lufia: Let's return together
       after we rescue your
       father.

After rescuing Raile.

Raile: Good grief! Thank you!

Lou:   Caught so easily by the
       pirates, eh? What a klutz!
       You haven't changed a bit!

Raile: Huh? Isn't......isn't that
       boy......? Why, it's Lou!

Lou:   Yo! Dad! You didn't
       know it was me for a
       moment, did you?

Raile: That's because boys of your
       age grow so fast. It's hard
       to recognize them.

Lou:   You can't recognize your
       own son just because I
       grew taller?

Raile: Don't be silly.

Lufia: Stop it you two! It's been
       a long time since you've
       met. Don't start by arguing!

Hero:  Like father, like son, eh?

Aguro: Oh, brother!

Hero:  By the way, Raile. We've
       found 7 pieces of Alumina.
       Can we repair Falcon now?

Raile: Of course. Let's start
       right away! Please go to
       Lab 3.

Everybody appears outside.

Raile: I'm sailing back to Lab 3.
       What will you do, Lou?

Lou:   Oh, I don't know. Maybe....

Lufia: Go with your father, Lou.

Hero:  Yes. Go with your father,
       Lou.

Lou:   To tell the truth, I
       really don't want to go with
       him. But, I don't know what
       he'll do without me.

Aguro: You're right. Watch him
       carefully. Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Lufia: Raile, be good to him,
       won't you?

Raile: I'm always good to Lou!

Lou:   If that's true, why don't
       you write once in a while?

Raile: Write? You know, I just
       invented a voice box.
       Use this and you can speak
       to someone far away.
       You won't need letters.

Jerin: Awesome! That sounds
       really handy.

Raile: Of course, you'll need
       a cord to connect them,
       you see.

Lou:   Why are you always
       making such useless
       things?

Raile: Useless? I don't think so.
       You can talk to anyone,
       anywhere in the world
       with this!
       Isn't that amazing?

Lou:   Who's going to lay the line?
       THINK before you dream
       something up!

Lufia: Oh, these two....

Hero:  Don't worry. Look.
       They're laughing.

Lufia: I guess so.

Raile: Like I said, I'll be
       in Lab 3.

       Falcon around.

Cooper: Right.

Raile: Let's go!

Cooper: Professor. Everything
        is ready!

Raile: A genius like me can repair
       this in a matter of seconds!

Jerin: Have you fixed it already?

Raile: I told you I'm a genius!

Hero:  So, can we travel
       underwater now?

Raile: Of course! There's nothing
       to worry about. Climb
       aboard!

Lufia: Hero! At last we can go
       to Doom Island. I hope
       we'll find the Dual Blade!

Raile: Falcon can dive wherever
       there's an eddy.
       There's a ring-shaped
       island north by northeast.
       They say that's the place
       where Doom Island fell.
       The village of Soshette is
       on the north side of the
       island. Let's go there
       first.

Hero:  Thank you so much,
       Professor! Let's go!

Upon entering the fortress.

Hero:  There's still air in here!
       Something feels strange.

When you find the Dual Blade.

Hero:  Is this the Dual Blade?

Aguro: What's that sound?

Hero:  The Dual Blade. It's
       ringing!
(Hero gets the Dual Blade.)

Aguro: What the......!?

Statues rise from the ground.

Hero:  Sinistrals!

Aguro: No. Stone statues of the
       Sinistrals.

Hero:  Those ones are Amon and
       Gades. Good work. Looks
       just like them.

Aguro: That means Daos and Erim
       are at the back.
       Hero. Come here for a
       moment.

Hero:  This one!?

Lufia: Is this statue....me?
       Is this me?

Jerin: This is Lufia, isn't it?
       Why is a statue of Lufia
       among the Sinistrals?

Lufia: How would I know?

Jerin: But everyone would agree
       that this is a statue of
       Lufia.

Lufia: What? Are you saying
       I'm a Sinistral?

Jerin: Well, no. I didn't mean
       it that way.

Lufia: I'm Lufia. I was raised by
       Roman at the Alekia Inn.
       I'm just an ordinary woman.
       I know nothing about this.

Hero:  Lufia.

Lufia: Hero! It's true. I really
       don't know anything!

Hero:  I know. How long do you
       think we've known each
       other? You're Lufia, and
       no one else.

Lufia: Hero....

Aguro: Wait! Could this be a trap?
       Is someone trying to break
       us up?

?????: Possibly......

Amon and Gades appear.

Hero:  Amon! Gades!

Daos Appears.

Daos:  Maxim's descendant lives.

Hero:  Daos? Is that Daos?

Daos:  Yes. I am Daos. The waiting
       is finally over. The day of
       our reunion has arrived.

Hero:  Reunion? Where's Erim?
       I don't see her.

Daos:  Erim was revived
       16 years ago.

Hero:  16 years?

Daos:  Indeed. Erim is Lufia.
       Lufia is Erim.

Lufia: LIAR! You lie!

Daos:  Lufia. Do you remember
       your parents?

Lufia: ........

Daos:  Of course not. You have no
       parents. They never existed.
       You are Erim.

Lufia: ........!

Daos:  We can use our energy to
       assume any form we choose.

Hero:  Lufia doesn't remember her
       parents because they died
       when she was small.

Daos:  So you say. But why do you
       think we let you live this
       long?

Hero:  ........

Daos:  I am pleased. You have
       brought Lufia back to me.

Hero:  What are you saying?

Daos:  Don't you see? Maxim
       destroyed us 99 years
       ago. Now Lufia has
       returned us to life.
       Lufia's power brought
       our energies together
       once more.

Lufia: NO! NOOO!!

Hero:  It's a lie! She could never
       revive you! You're lying!

Daos:  Hear me, mortal! Look past
       your emotion. see the truth
       of my words.
       Go ahead. Ask her
       a question.

Daos uses a spell on Lufia.

Lufia: Aaaah!

Hero:  Lufia! Lufia! Speak to me!

Daos:  She is still alive. I only
       shocked her to unlock the
       memories.

Lufia: My head. Hero, help me!

Hero:  Lufia! Hang on!

Amon:  Daos. Her recovery will
       take time.

Daos:  We have all the time
       in the world. Come....

The three Sinistrals leave.

Aguro: An earthquake!

Hero:  No! The fortress is
       moving.

Jerin: Hero!
       
Hero:  Jerin! Escape!

Jerin: Let's get out of here!

They escape and see Doom Island floating.

Jerin: Hero! Doom Island!

Aguro: I don't like the look
       of this, Hero.

Hero:  Let's head to the inn at
       Soshette. I'm worried
       about Lufia.

Everybody at the inn.

At the inn.

Jerin: Lufia went to sleep.

Aguro: Hero. About what the
       Sinistrals said...

Hero:  Tomorrow, Aguro. I'm
       tired. I just want to
       get some sleep.

In the morning.

Lufia: Is this place Soshette?
       I remember now. I fainted.

Lufia walks over to Hero and Aguro's room.

Lufia: Hero? Are you awake?

Aguro: Hero. What are we
       going to do?

Hero:  About what?

Aguro: Lufia, of course.

Hero:  What's wrong with Lufia?

Aguro: Stop living in a fantasy!
       Can you deny what Daos
       said?

Hero:  What are you saying?
       Erim's dead. All we have
       to do is destroy Amon,
       Daos, and Gades!

Aguro: I agree. But, remember what
       Daos said about the reunion!
       Do you think Lufia brought
       the Sinistrals back to life?

Hero:  What are you trying
       to say?

Aguro: Even if we destroy the 3
       remaining Sinistrals,
       they'll continue to return
       as long as Lufia lives!

Hero:  ........

Aguro: If it's true, Hero, what
       are you going to do?

Hero:  We have to destroy them!

Aguro: Hero? Do you realize what
       you're saying?

Hero:  ........

Aguro: You'll have to destroy
       Lufia, too. Can you do
       that?

Hero:  Truthfully, I'm not sure.
       I've never really thought
       about it.
       Obviously, I don't want
       to think about it either.
       Aguro. Listen to me.

Aguro: What is it?

Hero:  Do you think Lufia would
       try to harm us?

Aguro: Why are you asking me?
       How should I know?

Hero:  Let's not talk about it
       anymore. We'll just wait
       and see what happens.

Aguro: Alright.

Hero:  Let's see if Jerin and
       Lufia are awake yet.

Lufia runs back to her and Jerin's room and gets into bed.

Hero:  Jerin? Lufia? Are you
       awake? I'm coming in.

Jerin: Ahh....Is it morning
       already?

Aguro: Let's get moving! Let's
       go!

Jerin: It's too early to shout,
       Aguro!

Lufia: Good morning, Hero.

Hero:  Good morning, Lufia.
       Sleep well?

Lufia: Mm.

Hero:  How's your head?

Lufia: Ok. It doesn't hurt now.
       I'm fine.

Hero:  Good.

Lufia: Aren't you going to ask me?

Hero:  What?

Lufia: My memory! Don't you
       want to know if my
       memory's returned?

Hero:  You don't remember a
       thing, do you?

Lufia: No. But, do you trust
       me?

Hero:  It doesn't matter. You're
       Lufia. You don't have to
       remember anything.

Lufia: Hero.

Hero:  Do you trust yourself?

Lufia: Thanks. I'm fine.

Aguro: Hero:  What will we do
       now?

Jerin: Doom Island is floating
       in the sky!

       Falcon can fly. Let's go

Hero:  We escaped just in time.
       And Professor....

Raile: I know. Falcon can travel
       through the air. But you
       need Power Oil for that.

Hero:  Power Oil?

Raile: It gives great lift. We
       haven't used it because
       it's very dangerous.

Hero:  And where is it?

Raile: It should be for sale in
       Epro. Go and buy some.
       I'll head for Frederia.

Hero:  Frederia?

Raile: Lab 4 is there. It's the
       only place where I can
       refit Falcon.
       Frederia is due south. I'll

          today.

Hero:  Where do you get Power
       Oil?

Merchant: In the "Oil Cave" north
          of town. But, a large
          landslide closed off the
          road recently.
          A man named Hedge tried
          to get through, but he

Hero:  And where can I find this
       Hedge?

Merchant: I think he's north of town.
         He's looking for a way
         through.

When you find and speak to Hedge.

Hero:  Are you Hedge?

Hedge: That's right. Who
       are you and what do
       you want?

Hero:  Please tell us where
       the Power Oil is.

Hedge: It's in the Oil Cave
       north of here.
       This is the road, but, as
       you can see, it's been
       blocked by a landslide.
       You're searching for
       the Power Oil?

Hero:  Yes.

      another time.

?????: I understand.

Daos:  We have Dual Blade.
       Hero is nothing
       without it!

Aguro  and Jerin awake.

Aguro: What....what happened?
       Are you alright, Hero?

Hero:  I'm fine. Lufia?
       Jerin? Are you alright?

Jerin: Yes.

Hero:  Lufia? Where's Lufia??

Aguro: She's gone!

Jerin: Hero! The Dual Blade!

Hero:  Where is it?
       I can't find it!
       IT'S GONE!!

Aguro: Hero. Can it be true?

Hero:  Don't say it, Aguro. Not
       a word! This can't be
       true!

Jerin: Hero.

The scene switches to Lufia and the three other Sinistrals.

Daos:  Erim. Welcome, my sister.

Lufia: I have the Dual Blade.

Daos:  Good. Give it to me.

Lufia: Why didn't you destroy me?
       I could have defeated you
       with this.

Daos:  You wouldn't do that.
       You are Erim. You're
       one of us.

Lufia: ........

Daos:  Now. Give me the Dual Blade.
       Wretched sword!
       Feel my wrath!

Daos breaks the Dual Blade.

Daos:  We are one. The world will
       once again be ours. The
       reign of Terror returns!
       Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

The scene switches back to Hero, Aguro, and Jerin.

Aguro: Hero! Doom Island is
       starting to move again!

Jerin: It's heading southeast.

Hero:  Come one! After it!


******************************************************************************
63. Doom Island Fortress 2 ***************************************************
******************************************************************************
When you reach the end of the Fortress.

Jerin: Hero! The Dual Blade!

Aguro: It's smashed into splinters!

Daos, Gades, and Amon warp in.

Hero:  Daos!

Daos:  You cannot win without
       the Dual Blade.

Hero:  ........

Daos:  Hero. Why do you fight us?

Hero:  I want Lufia back.

Daos:  Really? But does she want
       you? I wonder.......

Lufia warps in.

Hero:  Lufia.

Lufia: ........

Hero:  Lufia!

Daos:  There is your answer.

Lufia: ........

Hero:  LUFIAAA!!

Aguro: Wait! What's that sound?

Hero:  It's the Dual Blade!

Daos:  Impossible!
       We destroyed it!

Aguro: It's flowing with
       Hero's energy!

The Dual Blade fixes itself and returns to Hero.

Hero:  Dual Blade!

Jerin: Hero!

Aguro: Hero!

Hero:  Maxim. Thank you.

Gades: So! The little knight has
       a little sword! But does
       he know how to play with
       it?

After defeating Gades and moving forward.

Amon:  Here is your reward for
       99 years of grief!

After defeating Amon and moving forward.

Daos:  Your energy flows just
       like Maxim's did.
       But can you wield the
       Dual Blade? Let us see!

After defeating Daos.

Daos:  This time I will finish
       what I started 99 years
       ago!

Aguro: Four Sinistrals become
       one!

Jerin: How can this be possible?

Hero:  Lufia! Lufia!

Gades: The energy of the Dual
       Blade! It can't be!

Amon:  Daos! Erim's energy is
       growing unstable!

Daos:  Erim! My sister!

Lufia: My....my head! Aaaah!

Hero:  Lufia!
       Lufia! Can you hear me?

Lufia: Hero?

Hero:  Do you know me?

Lufia: I remember....but, who
       am I?

Hero:  Good. Good!

Lufia: Hero.

Aguro: Hero, Lufia! Stand back!
       The Sinistrals are changing
       again!

Daos:  Descendant of Maxim!
       Nothing will stand
       against me this time!
       Come to me! Meet the
       hideous destiny you
       so richly deserve!

After defeating Guard Daos.

Hero:  Lufia.
       Lufia?

Lufia: Hold the sword, Hero.

Hero:  Lufia....Lufia. What....?

Lufia: 16 years ago, I was born
       as Lufia. But I was Erim
       long before that.

Hero:  I....I don't believe that!

Lufia: Just as the Sinistrals are
       your enemies, those with
       Maxim's blood are mine.

Hero:  How can we be enemies?
       The Sinistrals are my foes,
       not you.

Lufia: I am the Sinistral Erim.
       Even if you defeat Amon,
       Daos, and Gades....they'll
       return again as long as
       I live.

Hero:  ........!

Lufia: Finish this, Hero.

Hero:  Lufia! Don't do this!

Lufia: Hero. destroy me!!

Hero:  The Dual Blade?
       Why did the Dual Blade
       go to Lufia? Where is
       she? I never wanted to
       fight her!

Lufia: Hero.

Hero:  Lufia!

Lufia: I was so scared. All the
       memories of Erim flooded
       into my mind! They just
       wouldn't stop!
       I started to forget about
       you, Hero.

Hero:  That's why you disappeared
       in front of me?

Lufia: But....when you called
       my name, I realized....I
       remembered you, Hero.

Hero:  Don't talk now.

Lufia: Hero, it's alright.
       The Sinistrals are gone
       forever.

Hero:  Lufia! Hold on!

Lufia: Hero. I was much happier
       in the short time I lived
       as Lufia than the eternity
       I spent as Erim.

Hero:  What are you talking about?
       We'll always be together.

Lufia: Hero, I don't want to
       go, yet. I want to be
       close to you, Hero.

Hero:  You won't die! I won't
       let you, Lufia!

Lufia: Really?

Hero:  Trust me!

Lufia: We'll always be together?
       For a long time? Good.
       Good......

Hero:  A long time, Lufia.

Lufia: ........

Hero:  Lufia?

Lufia: ........

Hero:  Lufia!

The bridge starts to collapse and Lufia falls off.

Aguro: Hero! Doom Island!
       It's falling!

Jerin: Let's get out of here!
       It's too dangerous!

Aguro: Hero! Come quickly!

Hero:  Lufia.

Aguro: What are you doing?
       Come on!

******************************************************************************
64. The Ending ***************************************************************
******************************************************************************
The scene switches to Shai Lab 4.

Cooper: Professor! Doom Island
        is descending!

Raile: Is it trying to land
       somewhere?

Cooper: No! It's out of control!
        It's falling!

Raile: What? Falling? Wow!
       They did it!

The scene switches to the Tower of Grief.

Old man: Elder! Doom Island!

Flake: I know. I felt the
       energy vanish.

Old man: You mean?

Flake: It's finished.

Old man: At last!

Flake: The people of our world
       can live in peace and
       safety once more.

Old man: Hurray!

The scene switches to Elfrea.

Artea: It's finished.

Mirka: What's the matter, Artea?

Artea: My long battle is over
       at last. Finally, real
       peace will arrive!
       Guy. Maxim. Selan.....All
       over. Everything is
       coming to an end.

The scene switched to Guy's grave.

Ainea: Uncle!

Former Guy Legion Knight:
       I know.
       Everything is fine now,
       Guy. Rest in peace.
       Sleep well.

The scene switches back to Doom Island.

Aguro: Hero! We're getting out
       of here!

Jerin: Hero! Quickly!

The three escape, board Falcon and fly to land.

Aguro: Whew! We escaped just in
       time!

Jerin: Any longer, and we would
       have disappeared with
       Doom Island!

Hero walks away.

Jerin: Hero!

Aguro: Don't Jerin. There's
       nothing you can say to
       Hero right now.

Jerin: But....but!

Aguro: We defeated the Sinistrals.
       Our journey ends here.
       No one can stop Hero.

Jerin: So, are we supposed to
       say goodbye now?
       Must it end this way?
       I can't........
       Hero....

One year later....

In Lorbenia.

Knight: Commander Aguro! Where
        are you going? We're
        training recruits today.
        You have to be there!

Aguro: I have something else to
       do. I leave the training
       to you. You can do it.

Knight: But! It's my first time!
        I can't....!

Aguro: Silence! Stop moaning!
       Just do it! That's an
       order!

Knight: Yes, sir!

Aguro runs to the Jerin at the dock.

Aguro: Sorry to be so long,
       Jerin.

Jerin: It's been a year.
       Hasn't it, Aguro?

Aguro: Yes.

Jerin: I wonder what happened
       to Hero?

Aguro: I don't know. He's not in
       Alekia. I don't know where
       he is now, but....

Jerin: But what?

Aguro: I know I'll see him again.
       I just feel it.

Jerin: Yes. I feel the same thing.
       We'll see him again.

Aguro: A year has passed, Jerin.
       And there's something I
       want to tell you.

Jerin: What's going on, Aguro?
       It's not like you to be
       so serious.

Aguro: How long do you think
       you're going to stay in
       this town?

Jerin: What?

Aguro: What do you mean, "What?"
       A year ago, you said there
       was no place for you to go.
       So I brought you here.
       And yet, you've never
       looked for a new home.

Jerin: What are you saying?
       Am I bothering you?

Aguro: Yes. You're bothering me.
       Thanks to you, I can't even
       eat unless I serve in the
       army!

Jerin: Hey! I earn my keep,
       don't I?

Aguro: It costs more than that
       when two people live
       together. I don't even
       have a girlfriend!

Jerin: You couldn't find a
       girlfriend even if I
       wasn't living with you!

Aguro: You weren't cute when I
       met you! One year later,
       you're still not cute!

Jerin: I don't care if you think
       I'm cute or not!

Aguro: What an attitude!
       No wonder you can't find
       a new place to live!

The scene switches to Arus.

Hero:  Arus village. Lufia's
       favorite flower, Priphea,
       was in full bloom then.

Hero walks to the flower and sees Lufia?

Hero:  ........!!

Lufia: Hello. Are you a traveler?

Hero:  Yes. I'm Hero. I've been
       traveling around the world
       for about a year now.

Lufia: Around the world? I envy
       you. I've never been far
       from the village.

Hero:  Excuse me, but may I
       ask your name?

Lufia: I'm Lufia. I live in
       this village with my
       grandfather.

Hero:  Lu....Lufia?

Lufia: Is there....is there something
       wrong with my name?

Hero:  No! No. Not at all.

Lufia: Oh, Grandpa!
       Grandpa. This is Hero. He's
       been traveling around the
       world.

Flake: Oh my! Welcome to our
       little village. We're
       simple people, but please
       enjoy your stay here.

Lufia: Say, Grandpa. If it's
       alright, why don't we
       let him stay with us?
       I want to hear about
       the world outside
       this village.

Flake: Now, that's a good idea.
       What do you say, Hero?
       Would you tell her some
       of your stories?

Hero:  Of course. I'd be happy
       to.

Lufia: Oh, thank you! I'll go
       and make some tea!

Hero:  Tell me, Flake.
       Who is she?

Flake: That's Lufia.

Hero:  That can't be true!
       Lufia is....a year ago....
       I....

Flake: We moved to this village
       after her fall from Doom
       Island. She was weak, but
       she survived.

Hero:  So, you're saying that
       she's really Lufia?

Flake: Yes. She's Lufia alright.
       But she can't use magic
       now.

Hero:  What do you mean, she
       can't use magic?

Flake: She's just an ordinary girl
       now.

Hero:  But, why....?

Flake: Maybe because of the Dual
       Blade. It's great power
       affects people in
       different ways.
       The  blade's energy changed
       Lufia. Her magic and her
       memory......all gone.

Hero:  Changed her? How can
       that be?

Flake: No doubt about it. When
       I found her, she couldn't
       even remember how to
       speak.

Hero:  Well, what about her
       memory now?

Flake: I taught her what she
       knows. Parts of that
       are just an illusion.

Hero:  I didn't know. But why
       do you want me to help
       Lufia so much?

Flake: I don't know. I just....

Lufia: Grandpa! Hero! Tea's ready.
       Come inside and relax.

Flake: Oh, you made cinnamon tea.
       You usually don't make it.
       What changed your mind?

Lufia: Well, we have a guest and I
       thought it would be nice.

Flake: When my guests come,
       you make ordinary tea.

Lufia: That's not true! Sometimes
       I make it for your guests!

Flake: Ha! Ha! That's alright. My
       friends alone can't make
       you do this. I understand.
       But Hero is your own age,
       Lufia. I know you'd want
       to do something special!

Lufia: What! Oh, you! How can you
       say that, Grandpa?
       Forgive us, Hero.
       Just ignore him.

Flake: I see. So, Lufia. You're
       saying you don't like
       him?

Lufia: I never said that! Let's
       just have our tea, please.

Hero:  It's Lufia. It's really
       her, isn't it?

Flake: Yes. But she's different
       from the Lufia you knew.

Hero:  I don't care! As long as
       she's alive.

Flake: Even without her memory?
       She doesn't even remember
       you.

Hero:  Memories......
       That's alright. We'll
       make new memories.

Lufia: What are you two talking
       about? The tea's getting
       cold. Come inside quick!

Flake: Come. Come in, Hero.
       Lufia's waiting.

Hero:  I'll be right there.
