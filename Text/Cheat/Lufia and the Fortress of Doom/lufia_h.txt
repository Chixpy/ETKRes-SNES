This FAQ/Walkthrough was written for Lufia & The Fortress of Doom for the Super
Nintendo Entertainment System. This is the first time I've written one of these
for a RPG. I wanted to keep things as spoiler free as possible, so if you use 
the walkthrough, you'll find very few references to anything story related.

Monsters: Mad Knight, Hydra, Efreet, Mad Wolf, Mega Frog, Rock Golem

After the games opening, you'll find yourself in control of the four heroes 
mentioned in it (Maxim, Guy, Selan, and Artea). All four characters are at 
very high levels and equipped with very powerful... equipment. Move north and 
you'll notice two gold notes. Go to the note to the west and read it. They 
both say the same thing:

                       "Move the pointer to the 
                        spell. Press the "X" button 
                        to see what the spell can
                        do."

Did I forget to mention three of the four characters have numerous spells 
learned as well. Take a look at them now and see what they do if you'd like.
When you're ready to proceed, enter the door next to the note to the west. 
Open the chest which contains a power potion. Then enter the stairs to the 
west. Go south, then east, and north as soon as possible. Enter the door, 
it leads to a room with three chests, they contain a speed potion, mind potion,
and a great potion. After ransacking the chests, exit the room, and enter the 
stairs to the east. Open the chest to find a spell potion, and then exit 
through the door to find yourself at the beginning again. Proceed north and 
enter the stairs. Now you have two directions to choose from, north and east. 
Go to the east first and enter the door to find a chest containing another 
power potion. Exit the room, take the north path this time, and enter another
door. Now you'll find you can only go to the left, proceed until you reach 
the end of the hallway, and exit through the door. There are stairs to the 
south and a door to the west. Go through the door to find a chest containing 
another spell potion. Now take the stairs. Ignore the ladders and proceed to 
the top of the room taking either path. You'll find two chests each of which 
contains a Miracle. After opening the chest, return to the beginning and take 
the first ladder. There are stairs on the top of this floor, they lead to a 
room containing floor panels which restore your HP and MP when you stand on 
them. Go to them if you'd like. When ready, take the second ladder, and enter 
the stairs at the top of that floor. Proceed through door and you'll be in a 
room with three paths. Go either west or east and follow whichever path all 
the way around picking up the three chests you'll find on your way (each 
contains a miracle). Now that's you've opened all the chests, go north to the 
bridge which triggers dialogue. When you gain control of your characters, 
step into the portal. You'll find your party transported to a room with 
another bridge. Heal all your characters before proceeding across. Doing so 
triggers more dialogue. Once you regain control of your characters, you're in 
a boss fight with Gades (one of the Sinistrals). He uses nothing but physical 
attacks which strike one of your characters per turn. You should have no 
trouble with him, just watch your character's HP and heal when needed. After 
defeating Gades heal up before proceeding north because doing so will trigger 
a battle with Amon (another Sinistral). This Sinistral uses nothing but 
"Sunder" a magic attack which strikes every one of your characters. Still 
just watch your HP and he should be no problem. Heal after defeating Amon 
because you guessed it, proceeding triggers a battle with Erim (another 
Sinistral). She attacks with "Thunder" which strikes one of your characters. 
Once again just watch your HP and she shouldn't be a problem. Heal after 
defeating Erim. Now all that's left is to proceed and battle Daos. Daos 
attacks using a couple different magic attacks which hit all of your 
characters. Strangely enough this seems to be the easiest of the four battles. 
After defeating him... we'll you'll see. 
                                                                 _

So we've finally gained control of Hero, it's a good idea to talk to everyone 
in town once, so make sure to talk to everyone you encounter while exploring. 
First off go in the building directly to your east and search the dresser 
between the two shops to find a potion. I recommend buying a dagger from the 
weapons shop while you're there. Afterwards head to the inn and go upstairs. 
Search the dresser to find a dress. Next go west to the hut and you'll see a 
chest and stairs in it. Head directly west and you'll also see stairs in the 
house there as well. Take the stairs and follow the path to reach the chest in 
the hut, it contains sweet water. Now backtrack and cross the bridge east of 
the hut, then follow the west path to it's end to find a house with three 
knights. The bush outside it contains a power potion and search the dresser 
inside the house to find a cloth helm which you should equip immediately. If 
you speak to the knights one suggests that you should speak with the 
commander. Backtrack to the bridge and take the north path to reach the 
castle. Immediately upon entering the castle you should notice 2 stair cases. 
Ignore them for now and explore the floor you're on. The commander and a chest 
containing an arrow are in the northwest room. Talk to him and open the chest 
then go to the room to the east. Two of the bookshelves hold items, one has a 
swing wing, and another has an escape. Now it's time to head up stairs. The 
dresser in the northwest room holds a potion. A bookshelf in the next room 
also holds a potion. Now it's time to head up again. Talk to the Princess and 
she'll give you 100 gold pieces. Now you can head north, west, or east. First 
head west and enter the room there. One of the dressers holds a stuffed bear 
and one of the book shelves holds a bracelet. Now backtrack and go east this 
time and enter the room there. There's no items here but we want to explore 
everything, right? Exit the room and take the stairs next to it. Keep going 
down until you reach the three chests on the first floor. They contain a 
revive, an antidote, and a sweet water. Backtrack to the Princess again and 
this time head north to reach the King's throne room. Talk to the King and 
then take either staircase which leads to the roof. There's nothing up here 
either. Alright now it's time to leave for Sheran so backtrack and exit the 
town. Leveling up a little bit is a good idea. After each battle or two simply 
return to the inn to restore all of your HP for free. There is a warp shrine 
to the west but there's no reason to go there now. If you decide to check it 
out now anyway, talking to the old man there will restore your HP. I recommend 
getting up to level four before proceeding because that's when Hero learns the 
strong magic which will partially heal one character's HP. When you're ready 
to continue, head north and enter the small town you come across.
                                                                 _

------------------------

First off go to the tree with the blue circles on it (supposed to be fruit I 
guess) and search behind it to find a mind potion. Next go to the house all 
the way to the east and search the bookshelf for a smoke ball. That's pretty 
much all there is to do here. Speak to everyone else in the town once (it 
can't hurt) and then exit. Continue north and you'll notice two cave 
entrances. For now, enter the northernmost one.
                                                                 _

Monsters: Spider, Jellyfish, Madshroom
Number of Chests: 2
Items Found: Potion, 200 gold, revive

You can only go one direction from this cave entrance. Follow the path and 
you'll come across a door. Enter it to find a room with two chests. One 
contains 200 gold and the other a potion. If you try to go further you'll see 
that your path is blocked. Backtrack, exit, and now enter the other cave 
entrance.

Follow the northeast path to it's end first and search the rocks there to find 
a revive. Backtrack to the beginning and climb up the rope ladder to the west.
Follow the path to it's end where you'll find stairs that lead out of the cave.
Once out of the cave you'll be right next to Sheran. You can explore further 
to the west now but I wouldn't recommend it, there'll be time enough for that

Upon entering Sheran I think it becomes apparent that the rumor was true. Walk 
around and see what everyone has to say. Then proceed all the way north to the 
castle. Ignore the stairs for now. There's a room to the west and one to the 
east, each room holds chests. All the chests in the west room contain potions. 
The chests in the east room contain sweet water, an antidote, foul water, and 
an awaken. After ransacking all the chests, enter the stairs. Go to the 
eastern room and search the dresser to find a revive. The three chests in the 
room contain 2 arrows and a mid arrow. The room to the west contains nothing. 
You can go upstairs now but there's nothing to do there yet. For now return to 
Alekia.

Talk to Roman, hear what he has to say, and then rest. Next head up the stairs 
to the inns second floor to speak with Lufia. Leaving the inn will spark more 
dialogue with Roman, after that leave Alekia and after a long talk with Lufia, 
she joins your party. Immediately after she joins your party, reenter Alekia 
and purchase her a dagger and a cloth. Equip them on her and while you're at 
it, you should also have a bracelet she can use. Now's a good time to go to 
the castle and speak with the commander. That's pretty much all there is to do 
in Alekia for now. Before departing you'll want to level up a little since 
Lufia is at level 1. Once you feel you've leveled up enough, depart for Sheran 
again.

When you reach the cave on your way to Sheran you'll see Danil on the floor. 
Speak with him and he gives you a key to Sheran Castle. Go to the castle once 
you reach Sheron. Go up the first two flights of stairs and then walk straight 
ahead to enter the King's throne room. This is where you use the key from 
Danil. Open the door to the west and flip the switch. Behind the door to the 
east is a chest containing 100 gold pieces. Exit the throne room and head to 
either the northeast or northwest. Whichever way you'll find a door, enter it 
and keep going down flights of stairs till you reach the bottom floor. When 
you get to the bottom floor you'll find the King, Lilah, and another girl. 
After they join you, enter the room they were in and search the bookcase for a 
great potion. Make your way out of the castle, entering the town area triggers 
dialogue followed by a battle which you cannot win, and then more dialogue. 
Once you regain control of Hero and Lufia, you're back in Alekia.

Like Lilah says, it's located southwest of Sheran. The inn and hut have 
reopened in Sheron if you want to stop by on you're way to Treck.

As with every new town you visit, talking to each person once is a good idea. 
Go into the house east of the entrance and search the bookshelf for a hair 
band. You'll want to equip it on Lufia. Now take the stairs to the second 
floor and open the chest up there for a dress. Go into the lodge to the west 
and make sure you talk to the woman there. Now head back to the entrance. The 
inn is to the east if you need it. Whether you rested at the inn or not, head 
south to the weapons and armorer's shops. One of the bookshelves contains a 
power gourd. While there I suggest buying a long knife for Lufia. Next head 
south to the docks and once you're there go west and speak with the little 
girl. Then go into the door north of her which leads to the lodge's basement. 
In there you'll find two chests which contain arrows and a smoke ball. The 
crates in the room with the stairs contain a swing wing and an escape. Now go 
to the east side of the docks and speak to the old man there. After talking 
with him, exit the town and head to the East Cave, which is naturally east of 
Treck.

Head to the house west of the entrance, and speak with the former Guy Legion 
knight. Resting at the inn now is a good idea because a semi-boss fight is 
coming up. Next go to the docks and speak to the guy with green hair. When you 
regain control of your characters, you'll be in a battle against four Demon 
Lords. But fear not Aguro joins you. The Demon Lord's use the Magic Mirror 
spell so you'll have to use physical attacks against them. Just keep up the 
physical attacks, heal if needed, and you should do fine. Once you regain 
control of your characters, head to the armorer's shop and buy a cloth helm 
for Aguro. It's also a good idea now to go to the menu and switch his and 
Lufia's combat order. Rest at the inn and then head to the cave north of Treck.

Walk east upon entering and go up the rope ladder. Open the chest for a potion 
and take the stairs down.  Notice the transports, The north one's path leads 
to panels which restore your HP and MP, and the south one transports you back 
to the entrance. Walk southeast now where you'll find two more chests, one 
contains a potion and the other a power potion. Go back upstairs and enter the 
black hole if you want to use the transporters. If not backtrack to the 
beginning and take the stairs down. Avoid the mud because it causes damage. 
Walk south and enter the door to find a chest containing a daze ring. Equip 
the daze ring on one of your characters, exit the room, and walk west. Go up 
the rope bridge and take the stairs up. Walk west and go up another flight of 
stairs to exit the cave. Be prepared for another semi-boss fight when you walk 
onto the boat.

Monsters: Goblins (3 of them)

When you walk up to the boat there's a little dialogue and then you're 
attacked by three Goblins. You'll definitely have to heal during this battle 
so be prepared. I recommend constant physical attacks from Hero and Aguro, 
while Lufia concentrates on healing. 

After winning the battle your party boards the ship and sails back to Treck.
You're probably hurting from the battle against the Goblins so head to the inn 
and rest. After that, head west to the lodge and speak with the Maberia's 
Captain on the second floor. When you regain control of your characters, speak 
with the Captain again and you're off to Lorbenia.

Upon reaching Lorbenia, Aguro leaves you for a short while. Head to the 
Weapons Shop, it's the southwestern most building. The bookshelf contains a 
mid arrow. While there I suggest buying a staff for Lufia. Head west to the 
building with the two Merchant's Shops. Go into the back and head up either 
flight of stairs. Go southeast and open the chest for a sweet water, and then 
take the stairs up to the third floor. Walking into the dress shop triggers a 
little dialogue. After it speak to the woman in standing in the doorway of the 
backroom to trigger more dialogue. When you regain control of your characters,
head to the inn and speak to the innkeeper. As you exit whether you decided to 
rest or not, Aguro will rejoin you. Next I recommend heading to the Armorer's 
Shop and buying a tan shield for Hero and Aguro. That's all the armor I 
purchased here but don't let that stop you from buying anything else you'd 
like. When you're ready to move on, exit Lorbenia and head southwest to
Grenoble.

Upon entering Grenoble, head west to the Weapons Shop and search the bookshelf
for a potion. Next go to the northwest building and pay the guy 50 gold pieces
to pass. Go down the stairs and follow the path to a flight of stairs which 
takes you outside to another flight of stairs. Down the stairs you'll find the
treasure hunter shop. Speak to the old man, then the guy behind the counter 
and accept the "Secret Map" treasure hunt. Exit the town and head west to the 
Old Cave.

Equipment Found: Power ring, cloth shoes, tan shield, dress, hair band, heeled
                 shoes, earring

Speak to the man and then take the elevator to the second floor. Proceed south
opening chests along the way. When you see the chest in between the two toxic
marshes, proceed 3 panels south of it and search for a hidden ex potion. Enter
the door when you reach it where you'll find two chests, they contain a power
ring and the secret map. Equip the power ring on one of your characters and 
backtrack to the 2nd floor entrance. Proceed west and then south to find two 
chests surrounded by toxic marsh. They contain a dragon egg and a tan shield. 
Equip the tan shield on Lufia and proceed north to the door. Read the sign 
next to it and you'll see that only women can enter. Now as Lufia we enter the 
room where you'll find five chests. They contain the "fairy kiss", a dress, 
hair band, earring, and heeled shoes. Equip the heeled shoes and then return 
to Hero and Aguro. We got everything we came for so it's time to head back to
Grenoble.

Head to the northwest house. There's no way around paying the 50 gold pieces
again. Go to the treasure hunters shop and speak to the woman behind the

destination the Northwest Tower, which is naturally located northwest of 
Grenoble.

Equipment Found: Sonic ring

Head west upon entering the tower and enter the door. Follow it's path to 
another door which leads to a room with a chest containing a sonic ring.
Backtrack to the beginning and head east to a door. Enter it and then another
door find a room with two chests which contain a hi potion and a hi magic. Exit
the room and head upstairs. Go south and open the chest for a smoke ball. Next
head west and take the flight of stairs up. Enter the first door to find two
chests which contain a mind gourd and a power gourd. Exit and enter the second
door to find a chest contain a hi potion. Exit and head east to another door 
which leads to a room with a chest containing a revive. Go back upstairs and
head north to a door, enter it, and the next two doors as well. Ignore the 
first door you see in this room and proceed all the way south. There you'll 
two more doors. Each door contains a chest, the western room's one has a mind
potion, and the east holds a great potion. After opening the two chest return
to the door we ignored and enter it. Go up that stairs and proceed south to a
door ignoring the upward stairs along the way. Enter the door and the next one
as well and you'll be in a room with two chests and a note on the wall. The 
chests contain a power potion and a spell potion. The note says: "Overcome your
fear!" After reading the note and opening the two chests return to the flight
of stairs we ignored and take them up. Proceed north past the door to find two
chests, each contains a mid arrow. Enter the door now where we'll find Artea's
apprentice. Fully heal Hero before talking to him because he has to battle the
apprentice by himself. This fight is a bitch. Apprentice casts fake on himself
which raises his agility, this makes his attacks very frequent. You'll 
definitely need to heal during this battle, potions and strong magic won't do 
it though. We'll have to rely on hi potions instead. Physical attacks also 
won't do it for this battle, you'll have to use mid arrows instead. I had to 
use nine mid arrows and one hi potion to defeat him. After the battle walk 
north off the top of the screen to bring you're party outside. Head back to 
Grenoble, you know the way.

Enter the elevator and take it to the 3rd level. Proceed south, opening the
five chests in the area along the way, and then enter the door. Open the two
chest and then enter the door to find two more chests. Exit the room and 
proceed east to find two empty chests and a door. Open the four chests and 
search the eastern toxic marsh for a miracle. Go down the rope ladder and 
open the two chests to your west. Proceed east, open two more chest, and then 
enter the door. Open the six chests in here. The broad sword has an attack 
power of 81, however it is cursed, every time you strike an enemy your HP will 
drain, and once it's equipped it can only be removed at a hut for 600 gold 
pieces. I recommend not equipping it, but make sure to equip the brone helm on 
Hero or Aguro and brone breast on Lufia. Enter the next door where we'll find 
five more chests, one of which contains the item we came for. After opening 
all the chests, equip the spike shoes on one of your characters. Then head

Head to the northwest house and yes, pay the guy again. Go to the treasure 
hunters shop and speak with the girl behind the counter. She'll give you 1,000
gold pieces for the "silver wick". Next I recommend staying at the inn. After
which, exit Grenoble and head to our next destination Kirof. It's located 
southwest of the northern tower. On the way there you'll see a warp shrine. If 
you want to you can warp to the one west of Alekia, but there's no reason too. 
If your low on HP though you may as well stop by and talk to the old man, upon 
doing so he restores your energy.

Inn --- 20 Gold Pieces

Upon entering Kirof go in the back of the inn and search the bookshelves for a
bomb, hi arrows, and a mid arrow. Next go to the house north of the inn and
search the bookshelf there for plum cider. Then go east and into the back of 
the Merchant's shop to trigger dialogue. After the dialogue speak to Reyna. 
Then search the bookshelves for a stuffed dog, stuffed pig, sweet water, and a
hi potion. That's all there is to do in this town for now, exit and head east
to Medan.

Move east past the inn into a house with two bookshelves. Search them for a 
swing wing and an escape. Next go north to the Weapons Shop. I recommend 
buying a mace for Lufia and spears for Hero and Aguro. Go west to the 
Armorer's shop and buy whatever you want. That's it for the town area so go
north to the castle which triggers dialogue. After the dialogue, enter the
castle and go into the first two doors you see. Walk up to the hope ruby to 
trigger more dialogue. After it, exit the room and follow the east path to a 
flight of stairs leading down. Take the stairs down and follow the path to
trigger more dialogue. If you try to move further in after eaves dropping the
knight will stop you. Backtrack to the Castle's entrance and take either the
northwest or northeast flight of stairs up. Go to the throne room and speak to
the King to hear a rumor that's been going around. Backtrack and exit the 
castle to trigger more dialogue. Once you regain control of your characters, 
exit Medan and head back to Kirof.

Move one step forward from the entrance to trigger dialogue. I recommend 
resting at the inn now. That's all there is to do here, when you're ready, 
exit Kirof and head north to the Ghost Cave.

Monsters: Willowisp, Ghost Mail, Crazy Pot, SwordsPook, FlamesPook
Number of Chests: 24
Items Found: hi potion x 4, escape x 2, miracle, 500 gold pieces, revive x 3, 
             spell potion, power potion, great potion, mind potion, smoke ball
             hi magic x 2, speed potion, dragon egg
Equipment Found: Chain cloth, ghost ring, monster ring, wood shield

Move southeast of the entrance and open the chest for a hi potion. Move east
ignoring the rope ladder for now and enter the door to find a lone chest that
contains an escape. Exit the room and keep proceeding east and enter another 
door which has a chest that contains a chain cloth. Equip it on Lufia, then 
exit the room, and go down the rope ladder to your west. Proceed southeast 
after going down the ladder and enter the door to find a chest containing a 
miracle. Go southwest of the room and open the chest to find 500 gold pieces. 
Move west ignoring the first door. The second and third doors each hold chests 
which contain a ghost ring and a monster ring. Now backtrack to the very first 
rope ladder, go down it and take the stairs down. The blue panels on the floor
restore your character's HP and MP. Open the chest for a Revive. Of the two
flights of stairs going down, take the southern stairs. Walk east and open the
chest for a wood shield. Continue east and go up the stairs to find a chest
containing hi magic. Backtrack the hp and mp restoring panels and take the 
other flight of stairs down. Take the next flight up and open the chest for
a hi magic. Of the two new stair cases going down, take the southern one down
followed by another down stair case. Open the chest for a speed potion. Go back
up the two flights of stairs we just came from. Take the northern stairs down
this time and follow it's path to find a chest containing a dragon egg. Return
to the hp and mp restoring panels and I recommend leveling up near them. When
you are ready to proceed, backtrack to the very first rope ladder and follow 
the path next to it to a door. Enter the door and open the chest for a revive. 
Take the stairs down. Proceed south and open the chest for a hi potion. Go 
east and open the chest for another hi potion. Ignore the rope ladder and go 
north east to another chest which contains another hi potion. Backtrack and go 
down the rope ladder. Head west ignoring the stairs and enter the door. Take 
the northeast stairs down. Open the two chests which contain a spell potion and
a power potion. Enter the east door and open the lone chest for a great potion.
Exit and enter the west door where we'll find a chest and a knight. Open the 
chest for a mind potion and then speak with the knight. Agree to help him and 
he'll tell you the secret of this cave: 
"Things are not what they appear to be." 
Backtrack and this time go down the northwest stairs. Take either of the 
northern stairs down and open the two chests for an escape and a smoke ball. 
Go back upstairs and go down the middle southern staircase. Walk north and
your party will walk across an invisible bridge. Open the chest for a revive 
and continue north. Enter the door and you'll see Reyna. Heal your party
before speaking to her because doing so triggers a boss fight. Phantasm will
cast shield on himself numerous times which raises his magic resistance. We'll
simply have to rely on physical attacks them. He'll mostly use spark magic 
that hits your entire party. He'll also cast drowsy which always misses for 
some reason. And when his HP gets low he'll cast confuse, so be prepared for 
that. Just keep up the physical attacks with Hero and Aguro, have Lufia heal 
when needed, and this fight will be over in no time. After the battle we're 
taken back to Kirof.

There's dialogue after entering Belgen. After it speak to the girl walking 
around next to the Merchant's shop. Go east to the Weapons shop. I recommend
buying a long staff for Lufia, and brone swords for Hero and Aguro. Head north
of the weapons shop and enter the door west of the hut. Open the chest for a
float and a hi potion. Enter the stairs to the east. Search the bookshelves 
for a mind gourd and a power gourd. Talk to the girl next to the bookshelves
and answer "yes". Backtrack and go up the stairs north of the entrance and west

armor. Next go west and enter the door to find two chests which contain a hi 
potion and a hi magic. Go north at the intersection next, go down the stairs

backtrack and head south. Go down the stairs and enter the door. Speak to the
guy and when he moves open the chest to find the Dias Key. Exit the cave and I
recommend resting at the inn in Belgen before heading to the Dias Cave.

Items Found: Revive, antidote, awaken, mystery pin, shriek, stone cure, hi

Equipment Found: Flash ring,

Step onto the warp pad upon entering the tower. Ignore the two doors. There's
a portal in each. The portal in the west one leads to the one in the east room
and vice versa. Head north past another door to your east and up the stairs. 
The floor above you has seven chests and collapsing floor tiles. The light 
colored tiles on this floor mark the tiles that will collapse on the next 
floor. Take note of the tiles and then head up stairs. Open the seven chests 
for a revive, antidote, awaken, mystery pin, shriek, stone cure, and a hi 
potion. Backtrack to the door on the east we passed, enter it, step on the
warp pad, and go up the stairs. Walk south and you'll see three doors. Enter
the west one and open the chest for a flash ring. Skip the middle door because
the room it leads to is empty. Enter the west door and speak to the Knight in
there. He says: "The roof has many warp zones, but don't step on the one at 
the far end." You should listen to him unless you want to be warped back to the
entrance. Continue and take the stairs up, along with the next four staircases
as well. Step on the western most warp pad and open the chest for a miracle.
Head to the north of the room where there's three warp pads. Remember don't 
step on the northern most one yet. Enter the western one and then the two 
subsequent northern warp pads to reach a chest which contains another miracle.
Next head to the western most warp pad. Step on it, then the next two northern 
ones, and you'll find yourself on the platform with Jerin and the monster that 
flew away with her. Make sure you heal before approaching Jerin because
naturally we'll have to fight the monster. Follower uses physical attacks 
which aren't that powerful. He'll also cast Drowsy which puts your characters 
to sleep, drain which lowers DFP, and frost. When he gets low on HP, he'll cast
bolt, use Grin which confuses one of your characters, and cast stronger on 
himself which raises his HP. All that you'll need for this battle it constant
constant physical attacks from Hero and Aguro, while Lufia heals. Speak with
Jerin after the battle to trigger dialogue. When we regain control of our
characters, they're in Belgen.

The weapons and armorer's shops are to the west. Head there and buy only one 
long sword since you should already have one from the old cave. Head north of 
the weapons shop and search the bookshelf in the merchant's shop for a hi 
potion. Next head east past the stairs to a house with a guy in it. Search the 
bookshelves for hi arrows and a bomb. Head back to the stairs we just passed 
and go up them. Enter the house and go down two flights of stairs. Speak to 
the old man, buy his cider for 10 gold pieces he'll share some info with you. 
Talk to the old woman, answer yes to her question, and agree to buy her two 
ciders for valuable information. When you're ready to continue, exit Jenoba 
and walk southeast and enter the blue tower.

Monsters: Gargoyle, Horrorquin, Frog, Jellybean, Dark Elf
Number of Chests: 7
Items Found: Magic guard, sweet water, hi potion, revive, hi magic, green jade
Equipment Found: Blue ring

Upon entering the tower ignore the first door you see. Proceed east and enter
the door there to find a chest containing a miracle guard. Next go west past 
the first door, where we find another door. Enter it to find a chest 
containing a blue ring. There's nothing in the center door so head north and 
take the stairs up. Walk south and open the chest for a sweet water. There's a 
note on the wall to the northwest that tells you to go to the red tower last. 
After reading it or not, backtrack and enter the door south of the stairs we 
came from. The chest you see is currently unattainable. Go through the east 
door. Take the stairs up and walk west to find a chest that contains a hi 
potion. Go back down the stairs we just came from. Walk south from the stairs, 
then west, and go up the new flight of stairs. This takes us to two more stair 
cases. Go up the west stairs first. Follow the path all the way around. Open 
the chest for a hi magic and then go up the stairs to examine the pedestal. 
Backtrack and take the east stairs this time. Enter the door and fall down the 
pit. Open the chest for a revive and go down the pit again. Open the chest for 
the green jade. Go down once more and exit the tower.

Once outside the tower warp back to Jenoba and rest at the inn. Then exit the
town and walk south across a bridge. Walk east once you cross the bridge and 
enter the green tower.

First enter the west door to find a chest containing a green ring. The east 
door contains an inn if you need it. When you're ready to proceed, enter the 
middle door and then the next door as well. Now we have two staircases to 
choose from, go up the west one first. Lower the switch and open the chest for 
a magic guard. Now go up and east stairs. Go up the next flight of stairs you 
see and open the three chests for an ex potion, a revive, and a broken red 
sapphire that you don't keep. Go back down and go up another flight of stairs 
to the south. Open the three chests for a hi magic, ex potion, and a revive. 
Go back down and open the chest west of the south stairs for a swing wing. Now 
backtrack to the switch and raise it. Go back up the east stairs and you'll 
see that the stairs up there have moved. Go up either flight and then walk 
north to another flight of stairs. Go up it and pay the knight 100 gold pieces 
for some valuable information. Next take the south stairs up and another 
staircase to see the pedestal. That's it for this tower, walk off any side to 
exit. Walk south and cross the bridge, then walk northeast and enter the town 
of Ruan which just happens to be right next to the red tower.

Enter the inn and search the bookshelf in back for a hi potion. Next enter the

Head east to the flowers and notice the two flower patches shaped like a "+" 
sign. Search them both for a power potion and an empty bottle. Go north to the 
Jeweler and speak with the women in there. Then search the bookshelf for an 
emerald. Walk west and enter a house with an old woman in it. Search the 
bookshelf for a small knife. That's it for this small town. Exit and warp to 
Medan. Walk north and enter the cave.

Speak to the guy upon entering the cave. Go down either rope ladder and open 
the chest for a foul water. Go down the next ladder and open the chest for a 
sweet water. Walk past the door to the south and open the chest there for a 
bomb. Enter the door and speak with the old man. After the old man gives us 
what we cam for, enter the door the he just opened to find four chests. Open 
them to find an emerald, opal, 500 gold pieces, and a diamond ring. That's 
everything, so exit the cave. 

At this point the next floor of the Old Gave became available for me because 
Hero was at level 20. If he's not in your game, I recommend leveling up 
outside of Ruan until he is since the inn is only 10 Gold there. Or if you 
want, you can skip the next section and do it later.

You know what to do. Warp to Grenoble first and accept the "Golden Pawn" task 
at the treasure hunters shop. Exit the town and enter the Old Cave.

Enter the elevator, take it to the 5th floor, and then exit it. Walk south and 
open the two chests for a smoke ball. Enter the door to find five more chests. 
One of the chests contains the luck blade. Make sure not to equip it because 
it's cursed. Exit the room after opening all the chests. Search the toxic 
marsh to the east for a ex potion. Open the chest for a kite shield which you 
should equip immediately. Enter the door to the north where we'll find three 
more chests and two more doors. Open the three chests and then go through the 
eastern most door. Open the chest there for a hi bomb. Then enter the door to 
the east across the toxic marsh. Open the five chest in here and then exit the 
room. Go through the door to the south to find three more chests. One of them 
contains the battle axe which you should equip immediately. Enter the door to 
the south and open the two chests there. Cross the toxic marsh and open the 
four chests there. Search the toxic marsh directly below the east door for a 
revive. Enter the east door and open the three chests in there. You should 
have everything by now so exit the cave.

Return to Grenoble, get your 3,000 gold pieces for the golden pawn, and then 
exit the town. Warp to Ruan, rest at the inn, and then enter the red tower.

Upon entering the tower you'll notice four doors. Enter the western most one 
first and go up the stairs. Open the two chests for a high potion and a red
ring. Backtrack, enter the next door, and go down the stairs. Open the two
chests for a spell potion and a power potion. Backtrack once more, enter 
either of the two eastern doors, and take the stairs up. Now we have four 
directions to choose from. First enter the door to your east and open the 
chest for a float. Next go up the stairs to the north and read the note on the 
wall. Enter the door to the west next and open the two chests for a power 
gourd and a magic guard. Now there's only one direction we haven't gone. Head 
south and ignore the door. Instead go east and open the two chests for a hi 
potion and a hi magic. Go up the stairs to find two more chests. Open them for 
a magic guard and a smoke ball. Now enter the door we ignored. Go up the 
stairs it leads to and the next flight you see as well. Open the chest for a 
hi potion and then go back down. Walk all the way around to the other side, 
take another flight of stairs up, and the next flight as well. Heal everyone 
and then speak to the monster in front of the pedestal. The battle against 
Dark Ghost should take you all of three minutes. As usual, Hero and Aguro 
should launch constant physical attacks. Lufia should keep casting Bolt, while 
Jerin concentrates on healing. After the battle fall of any side of the tower 
and then renter it. Go back to the room filled with toxic marsh. There are 
three chests in there now. Open them for the blue jade, a dragon egg, and a 
miracle. That's all for this tower for now. Exit the tower. Enter Ruan and 
stay at the inn. Then head for the blue tower.

Walk north upon entering and search the flower patch to the west for a hidden
spell potion. Continue north until you enter a house. Open the two chests for
a speed potion and a mind potion. Go up the stairs to the west and we finally
get to speak with Artea. Equip Artea's Bow on Jerin once he gives it to you. 
Then go down stairs and hit the shops. When you're ready to continue, go down 
the east stairs and step on the warp pad, which takes us to the...
small shrine. Enter the door to the west, step on the warp pad there, then 
exit the shrine, and we'll be outside on a new continent. A warp shrine is to

Proceed north until you see the entrance to the castle, then go west and open 
the chest for an ex potion. Go down the stairs and open the chest for an ex 
magic. Search the bookshelf for a miracle. Speak to the three people and then 
head back upstairs. Explore the rest of the town and buy whatever you want 
from the shops. Then enter the castle area but don't enter the castle itself 
yet. Go east first and search the flower patches for a speed potion, mind 
potion, and, a great potion. Next go west of the castle, take the stairs down, 
and another staircase as well. Search the lockers for a hi magic and a hi 
gourd and then walk down another flight of stairs. Follow the path and step on 
the warp pad. Go north when you get to a four way intersection and step on the 
warp pad. Open the two chests for a yellow ring and a stone cure. The yellow 
ring is why we came all that way, equip it and you'll see that it's a very 
good defensive ring. Now backtrack and enter Odel Castle. Enter the north room 
and search the dressers for a spell potion, power potion, and two hi magics. 
Enter either of the two back to back staircases and you'll be in the thrown 
room. Speak to the knight standing next to the princess and agree to help him.

Go west into the house with the old man and old woman. Speak with them, then 
search the bookshelf for a hi magic. Exit the house and head north up the steps
to trigger dialogue. After it walk around to the northeast corner of the house
and search a yellow flower there for a hidden mind potion. Speak to the old man
in the house. Rest at the inn and then exit Arus.

Walk west and enter the cave. Walk west through it and go up the stairs to 
exit, this should take you all of two minutes. Then enter the Tower of Grief.

Monsters: Crazy Jar, Ghoul, Ice Snake, Blue Wisp, Yeoman, Halloween
Number of Chests: 8
Items Found: Revive x 2, dragon egg, stone cure x 2, ex potion, hi magic
Equipment: Purple ring

Ignore the door at first, walk around the east side, and open the chest for a 
purple ring which you should equip on one of your characters. Now enter the 
door and go up the stairs. Open the three chests for a revive, dragon egg, and
a stone cure. Next head west of the entrance and take the stairs there up. 
Follow the path and take another flight up. Now we're in a room with four 
staircases. Take the northeast one up and open the two chests for another 
revive and another stone cure. Next go up the southwest stairs and open the two
chests there for an ex potion and a hi magic. Now go up either of the two 
remaining flights of stairs. Step on the HP and MP restoring panels and then
head up the stairs between them. Open the chest for a miracle and then speak
to the old man. When you regain control of your characters, drop off any side 
of the tower.

Now warp to Odel and enter the stairs west of the castle's entrance. Proceed
to the four way intersection we visited earlier and follow the west path to
Platina which houses Shai lab 1.

Enter the house directly north of the entrance and search the bookshelves for
an ex potion, ex magic, and a revive. Everyone in this town seems to say 
something about the tower of light so talking to everyone once is not a bad
idea. Talk to the cleric to find out that Cooper is on the 5th level of the
Old Cave. When you're ready to continue, exit Bakku, warp to Grenoble, and 
then enter the Old Cave.

take the stairs down. Go south and up the stairs to find a chest containing a
mind ring. Backtrack and go north of the stairs to the House of Magic. The man 
behind the counter will make you 1 gloom voice, for every long nail and 
straw doll you give him. Go back upstairs and had for the Merchant's shop. 
Search the bookshelves for a hi magic and a hi potion. Next go up the stairs
east of the shop. The general shop seems to sell everything you've ever sold.
Enter the lodge to the south to trigger dialogue. Search the bookshelves there
for a ribbon and a gown. That's it for this shop, when you're ready to

Equipment Found: Sea ring, undead ring

Enter the door to the east, take the stairs up, and walk around till you fall 
through the floor. Open the chest for a sea ring then walk around till you 
fall through the floor again. There are three chests on the west and east 
sides of this floor. Open them all and then go up the stairs in the center of 
the room. Walk around to the entrance and enter the west door. Take the stairs 
up and walk around till you fall through the floor. Open the chest for a 
undead ring then walk around again till you fall through the floor. Take the 
stairs up and walk north. Examine the door to find out it's locked, then take 
either the stairs to the west or east up. Walk south and enter the first door 
you see. Open the chest for a stone cure and then go up the stairs. Walk north 
along the east side of the wall (unless you want to fall through the floor) 
and enter the door to find a chest containing a revive. Next go south past the 
stairs and open the chest for a revive. Enter the door to the east, don't walk 
straight to the chests, the floor below the east chest collapses. After you've 
opened them, exit the room and enter the door to the west. Enter the next west 
door as well and go up the stairs. Walk south and go through another door. 
Walk east, ignore the door and  go up the stairs. Follow the east path to it's 
end passing the door and open a chest for another ex potion. Now enter the 
door and go up the stairs. Walk south through the door and then west to 
another door. Follow this path to it's end to find a lone chest containing a 
miracle. Now backtrack all the way to the door we ignored earlier. Enter it 
along with the next door it leads too and take two flights of stairs up. Walk 
south ignoring the stairs and enter the door. Go up the stairs and open the 
chest for a power gourd. Now go back to the stairs we just ignored and go up 
them. The floor to the east and south of the chest collapses so walk around 
those sides and open it for a gloom voice. Walk northwest to a flight of 
stairs, take it up and the next and you'll be on the towers top floor. Make 
sure you are fully healed and Lufia has a lot of MP before approaching the man 
in front of the chest. His name is Guardian and he will cast magic that 
damages your entire party, he can do above 70 damage per person. Sounds tough 
but there's one spell that makes this fight a breeze. Lufia's Boost magic 
which restores about 90 HP to everyone of your characters. Have  Hero and 
Aguro use constant physical attacks as usual. Jerin doesn't seem to have any 
spells that do real damage to Guardian and her physical attacks do squat. The 
important thing is that Lufia cast Boost every turn. When her MP gets low have 
Jerin replenish it with items. Defeating Guardian triggers dialogue. After it 
open the chest for the light key and then walk off any side of the tower. 
Reenter the tower and go through the red door which we can now unlock. When 
you get outside just follow the path and enter Linze.

Walk north and go up the steps. Walk west to the weapons shop and search the
bookshelf for an escape. Walk to the northeast building and go down the stairs
and the next flight as well. Follow the red path open the three chests for an
escape, sweet water, and a dragon egg. The green path leads outside just west
of the Gayas Island Cave. I don't recommend entering it yet. Hero should be
at level 30 by now making the final floor of the Old Cave accessible. If he's
not I recommend leveling up outside of Linze till he is. Before departing for

then enter the door. Walk northeast and open the three chests for a great 
potion, and an escape. Walk east and open the empty chest since we have to 
pass it anyway. Continue past the rope ladder and open the chest for a mind

back at the beginning. Go down the rope ladder and take the stairs down. Open 
the two chests for a hi magic. Walk east and go up the stairs. Search the

the inn, and then warp to Linze.

             alumina, dragon egg, hi magic x 2, magic guard, ex magic,
             ex arrows, power gourd, mind gourd
Equipment Found: Silver sword, opal

The first floor of this cave is filled with collapsing floor panels so you'll
have to follow my directions carefully. Walk as far north and you can until
you hit the wall. Walk directly west and open the two chests for an escape and
a stone cure. There's two chests to the south and three collapsing floor 
panels. Simply walk south against the wall until you reach the chests. Open
them for an ex bomb and an ex potion. Now there's two chests directly to the
east but don't head directly east to them or you'll fall through the floor.
Walk around to reach the chests. Open them for an ex bomb and a revive. Now 
head directly west and purposely fall through the floor. We'll get the rest of
the chests up here in due time. Go up the stairs and open the chest for 
Alumina. On the bottom level there are three chests scattered around. Walk 
around and open them for a dragon egg, hi magic, and another ex bomb. Go back
upstairs. Take two steps north and then walk east until you reach two chests.
Open the for an ex potion and a hi magic. Go down the rope ladder and ignore 
the three doors you see for now. Head northeast and go up the rope ladder.
Enter the door and follow the path to reach two chests. Open them for an escape
and a magic guard. Now  go to the three doors we just ignored. Enter the east
one and go up the stairs to reach two chests. Open them for an ex potion and an
ex magic. Next enter the west door and step on the warp pad. Exit the room it
takes you to and you'll find a chest containing a revive. Now enter the middle
door and move the switch down. Go back into the west room and step on the warp
pad. Open the chest for a ex potion and then exit through the door. Go down the
stairs and open the chest for ex arrows. Walk east and you'll have a choice of
continuing east of going north. Head slightly north and open the chest for a 
revive and then take the east path. Enter the door and open the chest for an ex
potion. Go up the ladder, step on the warp pad, and exit the room to find a
chest. Open it for a silver sword which should be equipped on either Hero or
Aguro immediately. Next head north of the room with the warp pad to find a 
chest containing a opal. Enter the door to the north and follow the path 
around. Walk south and go down the stairs. Go down the first two rope ladders
and open the chest for a power gourd. Go down the rope ladder directly south
and walk east to a chest containing a mind gourd. Walk west and go down the
long rope ladder. Head east and open the chest for a revive. Cross the bridge
and enter the door on the southern path to find a HP restoring panel. After
stepping on it take the north path and speak to the man you run into. Ask him
about everything, when you ask about Brant he'll tell you where he is and how 
to get there:
"Marse is a port north of Linze. Follow the shoreline by boat and you'll find 
it."
When you walk away from Clank it will trigger more dialogue and he gives you
Maxim's wave ring, which should be equipped immediately. That's all for this 
cave, exit and head for Marse.

There's not much to do in Marse. Hit the shops as normal. Speak to the girl in
the hut to find out where Brant went. Then take the cruise, after all it's only
20 gold pieces. The cruise will show you four of our future destinations, one 
of which is the Loire Island. 

When you're ready to continue, exit Marse and warp anywhere. Then warp back 
to Marse to make the Falcon appear right next to it. Board the Falcon and 
sail east to Loire Island.

Needless to say, enter the cave. Walk east and open the chest for a miracle.
Continue east, go down the rope ladder, and open the chest for a hi magic. Walk
north and you'll see a chest. Head west above the rope ladder and walk past the
next rope ladder you see. Open the chest for a revive and then go up the rope
ladder we just passed. Open the chest up there for a mach ring. See the rope
ladder to the north and a chest. Go there next and open the chest for a gloom
arrow. Walk west and open the chest for a power potion. Go up the ladder south

rope ladder and a down staircase. Go down the rope ladder, keep walking west.
Ignore the bridge and go up the rope ladder to the two chests. Open them for a
revive and a power potion. Go back to the bridge and cross it. Continue walking
south along the west path and open the chest for great potion. Search the toxic

lone chest but do not just walk up to it. There's collapsing floor panels in
the room. Walk along the wall in either direction until you are directly west 
or east of the chest. Then walk over to it and open it for a hi bomb. Now walk
around until you fall through the floor. Open the two chests for a float and a
sweet water. Enter the door to the north and open the chest for a revive. 
Search the toxic marsh that looks like stairs going up for a hidden ex magic.
Now all that's left for you to do is talk to the guy to the west and agree to
help him. Speak to him again after the initial dialogue and he'll give you a
piece of alumina.

Sail back to Marse and rest at the inn. Then board the Falcon and sail to Ulupp
Island which is just south of Loire Island.

Head east to the inn and search the bookshelves for plum cider and a hi potion.
Continue east and enter what looks like a cave. Speak to the knight to find out
what the dragon eggs are for. Don't go and trade the eggs in yet though because
after doing so they will scatter and enter chests, some of which we have yet to
open. Then enter the house north of the inn and search the bookshelves there 
for a rod and an apron. Head west of the entrance and search the flowers in 
the space between the two shops for a great potion and a mind potion. Head 
north and enter the castle through the main entrance. Head up the flight of 
stairs. Go to the northwest room and search the dresser for an ex bomb. Go to 
the kitchen to the east and speak to the chef for some funny dialogue. Take 
the stairs up to the next floor. Enter the room to the north, speak to the old 
man and he'll mention our next destination. Then search the dresser for a 
power potion. Head up stairs and speak to the King and Princess. When you're 
ready to continue, exit Herat, and warp to Lyden.

east if you want to purchase anything. Enter the door north of the inn and
open the chest for a miracle. Go down stairs and search the bookshelves for a
straw doll and a gloom arrow. Next enter the hut and search to the west and to
the east of the cleric for a hidden revive and sweet water. That's it for this

Enter the house to the east and search the bookshelves for an ex bomb. Go to
the Merchant's shop which is the northwestern most building and search the
yellow behind it for a power potion. Enter the house east of the Merchant's
shop and search the bookshelf for an ex magic. Next go to the eastern most
building which is a closed down Merchant's shop. After speaking with him it
should be clear what our next objective it. When you're ready to proceed, 
exit Epro.

Walk northwest and cross the bridge. Then walk a little bit to the east and

There are two paths heading north and one heading west. Take the first north
path all the way around and open the two chests for a power potion and a big
arrow. Next go all the way to the end of the west path and enter the door. Open
the two chests for an ex bomb and an ex potion. Now take the other north path
and open the chest for a mystery pin. Enter the door to the north and open the
chest for a miracle. Ride the water current below the door and open the chest
for a hi magic. Backtrack to outside the door again and take west path below
the water current. It's important that you do not ride the current. At the end
open the two chests for a magic guard and a power gourd. Now take the north
path, open the chest for a grand blade, and then step on the eddy. Enter the
next eddy to the west as well and we'll be on the world map. Sail north and
when you get to land walk around, cross the toxic marsh to the south, and enter

             hi magic x 3, big arrow, miracle x 2, swing wing, hi potion, 
             ex bomb, great potion, power oil
Equipment Found: Dragon ring

Cross the toxic marsh, unlock the door, and enter it. Open the chest for 850
gold pieces and then go through the next door. Open the chest for a dragon 
arrow and then go down the rope ladder. Cross the toxic marsh and open the
chest for a hi bomb. Go down the next rope ladder and open the chest for a
dragon tooth. Then go down the next rope ladder and walk east and go down the 
rope ladder there. Open the chest for a dragon ring and search the toxic marsh
for a hidden hi magic. Go up the rope ladder, walk north, and open the chest 
for a big arrow. Then go up the rope ladder and open the chest for a miracle.
Backtrack and go down the west rope ladder, cross the bridge, and go down the
stairs. Proceed and you'll come to a rope ladder and a bridge. Ignore the
bridge for now and go down the rope ladder. Walk north and open the chest for
a dragon tooth. Now walk east under the bridge and follow the southern path to
reach a chest containing a swing wing. Go north and then west. Ignore the
stairs and continue west to reach a chest containing a hi potion. Backtrack to
the bridge we ignored earlier and cross it. Go up the rope ladder and walk east
across another bridge. Open the chest for an ex bomb. Cross the bridge to the
south and go down the rope ladder. Open the chest for a hi magic. Walk east
across another bridge, continue on and go down the stairs when you reach them.
Now there's three rope ladders to choose from, one to the north, south, and
east. Go down the south one first, follow the path all the way around to find
a chest containing a miracle. Next go down the north rope ladder and open the
chest for a dragon tooth. Now we're left with only the east rope ladder so go
down it. Don't go to the dragon yet. Walk around to the southeast and open the
chest for a hi magic. Go down to the dragon and open the one chest we can reach
for a great potion. Fully heal your characters and then walk up to the Dragon.
For this fight have Hero and Aguro attack as usual while both girls 
concentrate on healing by casting boost. After the battle open the chest for
the power oil. 

Exit the cave and warp to Carbis. Board the Falcon and sail far south to 
Frederia which houses Shai Lab 4.

hidden grilled newt. The building there is the inn if you want to rest. Next go
east and search the middle flower in the square flower patch for a hidden
miracle. The Weapon and Armorer's shops are in the building there. Head north,
cross the bridge, and enter the north eastern most building. Go down the stairs

Speak to the Dragon and he'll give you four choices:
1. "Raise everyone two level."
2. "Give each 3 "~ Potions"."
3. "We want a Might shield."
4. "We want a Might bow."

One is self explanatory and also a huge waste of a wish. Two gives you three
great, spell, speed, mind, and power potions. Three gives you the strongest
shield which Hero, Aguro and Jerin can equip. Four gives you Jerin's best 
weapon. I recommend taking the Might bow first. After picking something the 
eggs are scattered into chests and waiting to be recollected. I don't recommend
recollecting the eggs yet because you won't want to trade them in till later 
anyway. That is if you don't want to miss out on some items. 

When you're ready to continue, warp back to Frederia. Board the Falcon, fly
slightly to the west, and enter the town of Arubus.

want. Speak to the guy next to the Weapon shop and answer yes to his question.
Then enter the door to the west. Go down the stairs and open the two chests for
pear cider and plum cider. Go down stairs and enter the next room along the

             great potion, mind potion, miracle x 3, spell potion, power
             potion, glasdar key, gloom guard
Equipment Found: Zircon sword, white ring, gloom guard

Cross two bridges and open the chest for a hi potion. Cross the next bridge and
you'll come to stairs leading down and a rope ladder. Ignore the stairs for now
and go down the rope ladder. There's a chest to the west and the south. Open
them for a hi bomb and a gloom arrow. Then go down the next rope ladder and
open the chest to the east for a smoke ball. Head west and open the chest there
for a magic guard. Walk northwest and go up the rope ladder. Go south and open
the chest for a mystery pin. Head west and open the chest for a zircon sword.
Go north and enter the door there to find a chest containing a white ring which
you may want to equip on one of your characters. Walk east and open the chest
for a great potion. Now backtrack to the stairs we ignored earlier and go down
them. Enter the east door first and follow the path all the way around to a
door. Enter it, step on the warp pad, and open the chest for a mind potion.
Backtrack and enter the west door this time. Go down all three rope ladders.
Enter the door and flip the switch. Then open the chest to the west for a
miracle. Go back up one rope ladder and walk around to a chest containing
another miracle. Go down the two rope ladders and open the chest for one more
miracle. Backtrack to the warp pad we stepped on earlier and step on it again.
Open the chest for a spell potion and then go down the stairs. Open the three
chests for a power potion, gloom guard, and the Glasdar key. That's it for this
cave so exit it.

Rest at the inn in Arubus and then enter the cave southwest of Glasdar Tower.

Equipment Found: Black ring, sonic heels

Go down the rope ladder and open the chest for an ex bomb. Go down the next
rope ladder. Enter the west door to find a chest containing a black ring
which you may want to equip. Back out the door, open the chest to the east for
ex arrows. Search the toxic marsh for a hidden power potion and then head east
where you'll find two doors. Enter the south door first and step on the HP and
MP restoring floor panels. Then enter the north door and go up the stairs.
Go up the rope ladder and open the chest to the east for a stone cure. Go up
the next rope ladder and enter the next two doors. Now there's a door and a
ladder. Enter the door first and open the chest for a hi magic. Now go up the
rope ladder and enter the door up there. Open the chest for sonic heels and
the go through the next door. Open the chest for a smoke ball. Enter the door

to the east and open the chest for a great potion. Open the chest east of the
door for a miracle. Go down the rope ladder and open the chest there for a
gloom arrow. Go back up, walk west, and take the western most rope ladder up.
Open the chest for a mind gourd. Walk west, go up the rope ladder, and open the
chest for a dragon arrow. Go up the east rope ladder and enter the door. Enter
either of the two doors you should see now and then open the two chests for a
big arrow and an ex potion. Go up the west rope ladder next and open the chest
for an ex bomb. Walk east and ignore the rope ladder that leads to a door for 
now. Go up the rope ladder east of it and continue east to find a chest
containing ex arrows. Go up the rope ladder there and enter the door. Open the
two chests for miracles, and search the toxic marsh for another hidden miracle.
Return to the rope ladder we just ignored. Go up it and enter the door. Unlock
the door and step on the warp pad. Go up the rope ladder, take the stairs up,
and we'll find ourselves right outside Glasdar Tower.

Monsters: Gloom, Wing Lion, Humungus, Dragon, Mad Cleric, Red Skull, Whirlwind,

Number of Chests: 26
Items Found: Hi potion, ex bomb x 2, big arrow, ex arrows, mind gourd,
             power gourd, revive x 3, gloom arrow, miracle x 7, antidote,
             spell potion, power potion, mind potion, great potion, 
             speed potion, stun arrow
Equipment Found: Gloom ring

Enter the west door and open the chest for a hi potion. Then enter the east
door and open the chest there for an ex bomb. Next enter the north door and
take the stairs up. Enter the door to the east and open the chest for a big
arrow. Head north and enter the door there. Walk east and enter the next door.
Walk east again and enter the door to find a chest containing ex arrows. Next
follow the south path and go up the stairs. Enter the door to the east first 
and open the two chests for a mind gourd and a power gourd. Enter the door to
the west next and open the chest for a revive. Now enter the north door. Walk
in either direction and enter the next door you see. Open the chest to the east
for another revive. Then enter the door to the south, go up the stairs, and 
enter the next door. Open the chest for an ex bomb. The door to the north leads
nowhere. The one to the east will take us to the next floor but don't enter it
yet. First enter the door south of it and open the chest there for a gloom
arrow. Enter the door south of it and then the next door as well to find two
chests. Open the for a gloom ring and a miracle. Backtrack and enter the east
door and the next two doors as well. Walk south and open the chest for an
antidote. Continue south and go up the stairs. Enter the north door and then 
the door east of it as well. Walk south and you'll have a choice of two doors.
Enter the east one first and step on the warp pad to reach HP and MP restoring
floor panels. Now enter the west door and take the stairs up. Read the note on
either the east or west wall to find out what the switches to the north are 
for.

Stepping on the middle and east switches takes you to a room with a chest 
containing a miracle. Enter the next three doors and you'll come to a room with
ten chests. Open them for a spell potion, power potion, mind potion, great
potion, speed potion, revive, and 4 miracles. Unfortunately we can't warp back
to the switches, so get back to them the long way, and reset them by stepping 
on the one surrounded by carpeting.

If you step on no switch it will take you to a chest containing a miracle but
then you'll have to work your way back up from the very first floor. If you
want it go for it.

If you step on just the east switch you'll be taken to a chest containing a
stun arrow. You'll also have to work your way back up from the very first floor
for this... if you really want it.

Whether you decided to get the last two items or not, step on just the middle
switch when you are ready to proceed. Enter the next two doors and then take
the stairs up. We're on the top floor now so you know what that means. Make 
sure all of your characters are fully healed before stepping on the southern 
circle. This is the easiest boss fight yet. Use physical attacks on him with
all four of your characters. He'll probably silence your magic users but by the
time you need to heal, it should have worn off. When it does, simply have Lufia
or Jerin cast boost while the rest of your characters continue with the 
physical attacks. After defeating him there will be quite a bit of dialogue.
After it drop off the side of the tower and then you have a choice.

You can collect the dragon eggs for the second time or go right to Doom Island.
If you decide not to recollect the eggs simply skip the next section.
                                                                 _

Don't head to the Shrine just yet. First we have to collect the eggs for the
second time.

Their locations:

1. Alekia's Castle
2. Belgen
3. Northwest Tower (On the top floor)
4. Cave Southwest of Belgen (down the stairs that have a door to the west and
more stairs to the east)
5. Cave Northeast of Tower of Light
6. Elba Island Cave (Down the three rope ladders and all then all the way west)
7. Under Ring Island (In the West Cave)
8. Oil Cave (Go down the first set of stairs, then cross the bridge, and follow
the path)

After collecting them, return to the Dragon Shrine and wish for something. I
recommend getting a might shield this time. Now we can collect the eggs one
more time.

Their locations:

1. Sheran Castle (In Throne Room)
2. East Cave 
3. Old Cave 7th floor
4. Lyden
5. Cave East of Herat (Up the south eastern most rope ladder)
6. Cave North of Glasdar Tower (Flip the switch up and step on the warp pad)
7. Cave to Glasdar Tower
8. Glasdar Tower (In the room with ten chests)

After collecting them, return to the Dragon Shrine for your final wish. I
recommend getting another might shield.

Monsters: Act Dragon, WatersPout, Fire Wave, Electromaz, Whirlwind, Act Hydra,

Number of Chests: 12
Items Found: Power potion x 2, speed potion, mind potion, great potion,

Warp to Arus and fly northwest into Doom Island. Land on the circle. Enter the
door to the north and then the next door. Walk north and speak to the old man. 
Then enter the door to the north. Continue north, go up the steps, and enter 
the Fortress.

Enter the door to the west and open the chest for a power potion. Follow the
path and enter the door to find three chests. Open them for a speed potion,
mind potion, and great potion. Walk around to the east and go up the stairs.
Open the chest for a spell potion and then go through the door. Head north and
take the stairs up. Enter the door to the east and open the chest for a power
potion. Then enter the door to the north. Walk east and enter the door when you
reach the end. Enter the door to the west and open the chest for a spell 
potion. Then go up the stairs to the south. Don't go up the steps yet. First
walk around to the north and open the two chests there for two miracles. Now
go up the first steps. If you want walk around and take the steps on that level
to reach HP and MP restoring floor panels. Next go up the second set of steps.
Walk north and go up the flight of stairs. Enter the door but don't cross the
bridge yet. First walk around and open the three chests for three miracles.
Then cross the bridge and step on the warp pad. Cross another bridge and keep
walking north until you trigger dialogue. Heal up after the dialogue because
when you walk forward again you'll battle Gades. Gades can only attack one of 
your party at a time. Have Jerin heal the last person he attacked, while Hero 
and Aguro concentrate on attacking. Heal up after the battle. When you walk
further you'll battle Amon. Amon uses magic which attacks your entire party so
have Lufia heal using boost, while Hero and Aguro attack. He may confuse some
of your characters, so be prepared. After defeating Amon make sure to heal up.
The move forward to battle Daos. Be prepared to heal paralysis and use the 
same strategy for Daos as you did Amon. After defeating Daos you'll go directly
to the final battle. Hero and Aguro should attack as usual. Lufia and Jerin 
should cast boost. Your characters will be confused a couple time during this
battle but they usually tend to attack the boss anyway. After winning the
battle... Congratulations on beating the game. Enjoy the ending.
