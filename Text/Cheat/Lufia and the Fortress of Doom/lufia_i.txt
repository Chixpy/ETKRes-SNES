I. INTRODUCTION

This is a complete walkthrough for Lufia & the Fortress of Doom.  If you like 
RPGs with a focus on good, old-fashioned combat and exploration, with a silly 
twist added to it, this is the game for you.  If you're looking for an epic, 
western style RPG, it probably isn't.

I hope this walkthrough will help you have more fun with the game and provide
unique information not found in any other walkthrough.  It includes the
elemental weaknesses of monsters, as well as every treasure in the game.  The
recommended levels are based on fighting every random encounter, so as to avoid
the need to level-grind.

I will do my best to avoid spoilers to the plot in the walkthrough.  That said,
I'll obviously have to mention character names, dungeon names, and when you 
are told to do something or go somewhere.  If that is more information than you
want to know about the plot, then you may want to try the GameFAQs message 
boards.

If you have some new information, know something I missed, know a better way to
do something, got a death threat, or a marriage proposal, please send your 
comments to the aforementioned email address.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
II. USING STAT POTIONS

Throughout the game, you will pick up numerous potions that can apply a small 
boost to a specific stat.  Power Potions boost HP by 3-5.  I recommend giving 
these to whoever has the least max HP.  This is mostly to help the weaker 
characters survive multi-targeting spells.  Although at the start, some 
characters have a lot more Magic Resistance (MGR) than others, by the end, 
everyone should be roughly close to each other, due to the equipment available.

The remaining potions should each be used on a single character.  This is 
because a single boost won't make a great enough impact to be useful.  I would 
recommend giving Great Potions to Aguro to boost his attack power (ATP) by 1-3, 
since he doesn't learn any spells.  I would give Spell potions (+3-5 MP) to the 
Hero, because he has the least MP, yet the most expensive and useful spells
like Rally and Valor.  For Mind Potions, I would give them to Lufia to boost
her Intelligence (INT, boosts magic damage) by 1-3, since she is the opposite
of Aguro, using her magic nearly all the time.

Mostly important, I strongly recommend giving all Speed potions (+1-3 AGL) to 
Jerin.  Agility is kind of fickle.  It seems to give you a better chance of 
taking your turn before other party members, as well as executing your commands 
faster than your enemies.  However, it seems to take A LOT of agility for this 
to make a big difference.  Jerin could use this the most, so that she can cast 
her Confuse, Mirror, and healing spells the fastest.  This becomes far more 
important by the end of the game too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
III. STATUS EFFECTS

There are many status effects in the game that may not be self-explanatory to 
someone who hasn't played a lot of RPGs.  Here's a list explaining what each of
them does.

   Poison: Take 1 damage for each step taken outside of battle
  Confuse: Lose control of the target, as it will attack a random ally or enemy
    Sleep: Target cannot take actions
Paralysis: Target cannot take actions
  Petrify: Target cannot take actions or receive damage
     Dead: Target cannot take actions when HP is reduced to zero

Note that confuse and sleep can be cured by attacking the party member.
Confuse, sleep, and paralysis may randomly cure themselves after a round of
combat.  It's game over when the party is all petrified and/or dead.  Poison is
the only status that lasts after the completion of the battle.  All status
effects can be cured with the proper item or spell.

IV. WALKTHROUGH

During the walkthrough, I will follow this format for each section of the game.
Location > Recommended Level (for Hero) > Treasure List > Enemies (weakness) >
Shops > Walkthrough > Boss Strategy > Recommended Equipment.

FORTRESS OF DOOM [DOOM1]
Recommended Level: 78
Treasure: Power Potion, Speed Potion, Mind Potion, Great Potion, Spell Potion,
     Power Potion, Spell Potion, Miracle x2, Miracle x3
Enemies: Efreet (Water), Hydra, Mad Knight (Thunder), Mad Wolf,
     Mega Frog (Frost), Rock Golem
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
We begin our adventure controlling Maxim and Co. at the Fortress of Doom.  You
can skip the treasure here if you like, as it's not really important, nor does
it contribute to your final treasure count, but I'll go over it here anyway. In
the left room, you will find a chest which contains a POWER POTION.  Then, take
the steps down to the next floor.

Follow the path to an intersection, where you should go up to three chests
which contain a SPEED POTION, MIND POTION, and GREAT POTION.  Return to the
intersection and take the other path to the stairs back to the first floor.

Open the chest in the room which contains a SPELL POTION.  Leave the room, then
head up the main hall to the steps to the second floor.

Along the straight-forward path to the next floor are two enclosed rooms.  In
the first room, you will find a chest which contains a POWER POTION.  In the
second room, you will find a chest which contains a SPELL POTION.  Otherwise,
just follow the path through the hall to the stairs to the third floor.

Before climbing the above platform, you may want to walk around to the back to
find two chests which contain 2 MIRACLES, even through you already have 87 of
them in your initial inventory.  Return to the steps, then climb up to the
second platform.  If you care, the first platform will lead you to steps, where
you will find an HP and MP restoration tiles, but you won't need them.  Just
climb up to the stairs to the fourth floor.

If you like, walk around the perimeter of the room to find the final three
chests which also contain 3 MIRACLES.  From the steps, walk across the glass
bridge to the fifth floor where you will find what you came here for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Gades
WEAKNESS: Thunder
STRATEGY: Maxim and Guy should attack, while Selan casts Thunder every round.
Artea should cast Trick to boost Maxim's & Guy's attack power, then either cast
Champion (restore one ally to max HP) or Valor (restore all allies to max HP),
as necessary.
*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Amon
WEAKNESS: Fire
STRATEGY: Maxim and Guy should attack every round, while Selan and Artea should
cast Mirror on themselves, then the others.  They should be constantly
re-casting Mirror to reflect Amon's spells back at him for the entire battle.
*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Erim
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Use the same strategy as against Amon, except she is strong against
most magic.
*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Daos
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Use the same Mirror strategy as before, except Artea may need to heal
at some point.  Yes, they're all supposed to be this easy.
*******************************************************************************

After defeating the Sinistrals, the plot resumes, as we move forward to another
time long after the battle at Doom Island.

ALEKIA [ALEK1]
Recommended Level: 1
Treasure: Dress, Potion, Revive, Sweet Water, Power Potion, Cloth Helm, Revive,
     Arrow, Swing Wing, Escape, Potion, Potion, 100 Gold, Stuffed Bear,
     Bracelet, Sweet Water, Antidote, Revive
Enemies: Big Newt (Water), Jellyfish (Fire), Madshroom (Ice)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Inn - FREE

Item Shop            Armor Shop           Weapon Shop
*********            **********           ***********
Potion         8     Dress        120     Dagger   50 (buy for Hero)
Antidote       6     Cloth        140     Knife    10
Sweet Water   10     Cloth Helm   120
Arrow          2     Sandal        50

After being introduced to the main characters, you will gain control of the one
you initially named.  Return to Roman's inn and head upstairs.  Examine the
bookshelf where you will find a DRESS (sell).  Note that you can rest at the
inn here for free.

Go up to the weapon shop where you should buy a Dagger for the hero.  In
between the weapon and item shops is a bookshelf which contains a POTION.  Walk
back to the intersection by the flower field, climb the steps, and enter the
house to the far left.  Examine the bookshelf to find a REVIVE, and take steps
through a secret passage to a chest which contains SWEET WATER.

Return to the intersection, then cross the north bridge, and head left.  Hidden
in the flowers to the left of the house is a POWER POTION.  Inside the house,
examine the bookshelf which contains a CLOTH HELM (equip on Hero).  The people
around town tell you about Chatam and Sheran to the north.  Finally, you should
enter the castle north of the first bridge.

Pass up the stairs and walk to the upper left room where you can find a REVIVE
in the bookshelf and an ARROW in the chest.  Talk to the commander who will
tell you to go to Sheran to check on the rumors.  In the room to the right,
examine the bookshelves to find a SWING WING and ESCAPE.  Now, take either
stairs up to the second floor.

In the upper left room, examine the dresser which contains a POTION.  Check out
the bookshelf in the room to the right to find another POTION.  Then, take the
stairs up to the third floor.

Talk to Princess Estea to receive 100 GOLD for your journey.  Head to the upper
left room to find a STUFFED BEAR and BRACELET (save for later).  Outside the
room, walk around to the upper right steps, which you can take to a treasure
room on the first floor, with three chests which contain a SWEET WATER,
ANTIDOTE, and REVIVE.

That's everything you can get here, so let's head north to Sheran.  There's a
shrine to the southwest, but it just houses an old man who can restore your
HP/MP.  On the way to Sheran, we'll make a pit stop at the village of Chatam.
The monsters are nothing to worry about and combat is very simple to start.
Just keep attacking and you'll be fine.

Recommended Equipment
Hero: Dagger, Cloth, Cloth Helm, Sandal

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
CHATAM [CHAT1]
Recommended Level: 1
Treasure: Mind Potion, Great Potion, Smoke Ball
Enemies: Big Newt (Water), Jellyfish (Fire), Madshroom (Ice)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Inn - 5 Gold

Item Shop
*********
Potion         8
Antidote       6
Arrow          2

There's not too much interesting here.  Just a lovely small village to visit
and explore.  Check out the lower left tree.  Below it, you can find a hidden
MIND POTION.  In the middle of the left field, you can also find a hidden GREAT
POTION (save for later).  Finally, in the upper right house, examine the 
bookshelf which contains a SMOKE BALL.

An old man says that someone named Danil is worried about his sister, Lilah,
who works at Sheran Castle.  We should keep an eye out for her later.  When
you're ready, rest up back at Alekia, then continue further north to two cave.
Let's explore the eastern one first.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
CAVE TO SHERAN [CTSH1]
Recommended Level: 2
Treasure: 200 Gold, Potion, Revive
Enemies: Big Newt (Water), Jellyfish (Fire), Madshroom (Ice), Spider (None)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The two caves are actually one, but you cannot reach Sheran from the eastern
cave, so I figured we should clear that part out first.  Spiders are slightly
tougher, and can rarely poison you, but nothing you can't handle.  Follow the
straight-forward path to a room with two chests which contain 200 GOLD and a
POTION. Leave the cave, return to Sheran to rest up, then enter the other cave.

First, take the upper path to a seemingly useless dead end.  Walk all the way
to the end to find a hidden REVIVE.  Back at the entrance, climb the ladder to 
the stairs to exit the cave and reach Sheran.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
SHERAN [SHER1]
Recommended Level: 3
Treasure: Potion x4, Sweet Water, Antidote, Foul Water, Awaken, Sweet Water,
     Foul Water, Arrow x2, Mid Arrow, Revive, SHERAN KEY, 100 Gold,
     Great Potion, Speed Potion
Enemies: Anemone (Fire), Newt (Water), Earwig, Jellyfish (Fire),
     Madshroom (Ice)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Talk to everyone to find out what's really going on here and continue on to the
castle.  In the left room, open the four chests which contain 4 POTIONS.  In
the right room, open the four chests which contain a SWEET WATER, ANTIDOTE,
FOUL WATER, and AWAKEN.  Then, take the stairs to the second floor.

Examine the bookshelves in the left room which contain a SWEET WATER and
FOUL WATER.  Go to the right room, then open the three chests and dresser which
contain 2 ARROW (not to be confused with arrowS), a MID ARROW (save for later),
and REVIVE.  There's nothing else to do here, so let's report back to Alekia.

Report to the commander in the upper left room on the first floor of the
castle, as the Hero decides to return to Sheran on his own.  Return to the inn
to talk to Roman and rest up.  Then, talk to Lufia upstairs.  Attempt to leave
the village and Lufia will join.  Buy a Dagger and Cloth for her.  Finally,
equip the Bracelet on her that you found earlier.  She comes with the Flash
spell, which can one-shot anything at this point.  Have her take out the
tougher Spiders with Flash, while the hero picks off the easier enemies.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Dagger, Cloth, Cloth Helm, Sandal
Lufia: Dagger, Cloth, Bracelet, Sandal

Along the way back to Sheran, you will find someone in the cave.  Talk to him
to receive the SHERAN KEY.  Afterwards, continue on to the castle.

Take the nearest stairs up two floors to the roof.  Enter the center throne
room with the locked doors.  Open the right door to find a chest which contains
100 GOLD.  In the left room, flip the switch on the wall there.  Leave the
throne room, then head to either the upper left or right room (doesn't matter)
and take the steps down two floors.

Follow the hall to the steps at the middle.  The switch you flipped earlier
will have revealed the steps to the right to the dungeon level which you could
not access before.

Talk to the people in the dungeon to gain access to it and find Lilah.  Examine
the bookshelf inside which contains a GREAT POTION (save for later).  With our
mission complete, attempt to leave Sheran to meet the one responsible for the
destruction on Sheran.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: ?????
WEAKNESS: HA!
STRATEGY: None.  You have no way to win this battle.  The game might as well
have just said, "Go home."
*******************************************************************************

Fortunately, you manage to survive and are warped back to Alekia.  After some 
dialogue, head up to the castle.  Take the stairs to the second floor, and you
will find the Sheran survivors in the back rooms.  Talk to Lilah in the middle
room so she will join you.  Then, escort her back to Chatam.

Cross the bridge to the right to reunite Danil with Lilah.  She will tell you
that someone who knows about the Sinistrals lives in Treck, a port town
southwest of Sheran.  Afterwards, talk to the old man in the field to receive a
SPEED POTION (save for later) from him.

When you are ready, return to Sheran.  Cross the bridge to the west, then cross
the next bridge to the southwest.  Continue along the path to reach Treck.

TRECK [TREK1]

Treasure: Hair Band, Dress, Power Gourd, Arrows, Smoke Ball, Escape, Swing Wing

Hair Band     210
Sandal         50

Let's explore this village before actually doing what we came here to do.  In
the first house to the left, examine the bookshelf which contains a HAIR BAND
(equip on Lufia).  Upstairs, open the chest which contains a DRESS (sell).  To
the right of the entrance is the inn and item shop.  Now that we have a little
bit of extra money, it would be a good idea to buy some Antidotes and Shrieks.

Head down to the equipment shops where you can find a POWER GOURD (boosts ATP
in battle, save for later) and make recommended purchases listed above.  At the
weapon shop, skip on upgrading the Hero's weapon, since you'll find an even
better one soon enough.

On the southern end of town is the port.  Go into the secret passage and take
the left path to two chests which contain the ARROWS and SMOKE BALL.  Return to
the intersection and head up to the basement of the pub.  To the left, by the
boxes are an ESCAPE and SWING WING that are hidden there.

To progress with the plot, talk to the old man looking out at the sea, as he is
the one you came to talk to.  To learn more about the Sinistrals, he recommends 
seeing someone to the east and tells his niece, Ainea, to guide you through the
East Cave to get there.

Of the new enemies, Anemone's can Confuse you, so take them out quickly.  Use a
Shriek, if you can't finish the battle soon.  Baby Crabs are the toughest
enemies, so you'll need to gang up on them to defeat them.  To get to the East
Cave, walk east (duh), cross some bridges, and you'll find it.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Dagger, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Sandal
Lufia: Long Knife, Robe, Bracelet, Hair Band, Sandal

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
EAST CAVE [ESTC1]
Recommended Level: 5
Treasure: Cloth Shoes, Swing Wing
Enemies: Baby Crab (Fire), Bore Worm, Giant Bat (Water), Green Orb, Kobold,
     Nettles (Fire), Spider
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Follow the path down two rope ladders, and open the chest which contains the
CLOTH SHOES (equip on Lufia).  Then, take the steps down to the next floor.

Climb down the next rope ladder and Ainea will open the door for you.  On the
other side, open the chest which contains a SWING WING.  Go up that rope ladder
to reach the stairs to exit the cave and reach the house.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Dagger, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Sandal
Lufia: Long Knife, Robe, Bracelet, Hair Band, Cloth Shoes

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
GUY'S HOUSE [GUYS1]
Recommended Level: 5
Treasure: Short Sword, Great Potion
Enemies: Anemone (Fire), Baby Crab (Fire), Earwig, Giant Bat (Water),
     Green Orb, Kobold, Nettles (Fire), Spider
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Before talking to Guy, let's go tomb raiding.  Examine the tombstone to find a
SHORT SWORD (equip on Hero).  Then, enter the house and he'll tell you to head
to Grenoble.  Afterwards, in the house, examine the bookshelf which contains a
GREAT POTION (save for later).

On your way back to Treck, it would be a good idea for Lufia to learn Dew at
Level 5.  If she hasn't already, she should be pretty close.  At Treck, rest up
at the inn and save.  Some other folks have arrived at the port.  Talk to the
green-haired fellow, Aguro, only to be interrupted by some unwelcome guests.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Demon Lord x4
HP: 48 ea.
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Hopefully, Lufia will have learned Dew by now, so have her put it to
use.  I'd recommend using it in the first two rounds, so that Aguro can finish
them off.  Meanwhile, the Hero should be casting Strong to keep everyone's HP
up.  After Lufia has cast Dew twice, she should join in the healing with
Potions until Aguro can finish off the demons.
*******************************************************************************

Afterwards, Aguro will permanently join your party.  Purchase a Cloth Helm for
him and use all of the Great Potions you've been saving on him.  He's a pure 
melee warrior with no magic, so he needs all the help he can get.  I'd also 
switching Aguro's and Lufia's position in the Combat Order in the Menu.

Back at the pub, talk to one of the crew of the Maberia, who will tell you
where to go next.  To get there, you will need to go through a cave.  Rest up
at the inn, leave Treck, head north, around the west side of the mountains, and
you will eventually find it.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Short Sword, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Sandal
Aguro: Short Sword, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Cloth Shoes
Lufia: Long Knife, Robe, Bracelet, Hair Band, Cloth Shoes

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
CAVE TO MABERIA [MABR1]
Recommended Level: 6
Treasure: Potion, Potion, Power Potion, Miracle, Daze Ring
Enemies: Baby Crab (Fire), Bore Worm (Fire), Giant Bat (Water), Green Orb,
     Kobold, Nettles
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
They aren't new, but Giant Bats are weak to Lufia's Dew spell, which can wipe
out an entire group of them.  Kobolds can drop Mid Arrows, which will be very 
useful in the near future as well.

From the entrance, walk to the right.  You will see some steps above you, past 
the bridge, but that will take you to the exit, so let's go exploring for now.
Climb the rope ladder to the upper platform and cross the bridge where you will
find a chest which contains a POTION.  Take the nearby steps to the next floor.

It's a dead end, but you will find two chests which contain a POTION and POWER
POTION.  Back up the stairs, walk into the pit to the left.  Take the upper
warp point to a straight-forward path to find HP and MP restoring tiles. Return
to the warp point, then take the lower one back to the entrance.  Now, go under
the bridge to the steps you passed up earlier to the next floor.

Have the hero cast Float, so you can walk through the swamp unharmed.  In the
middle of it is a hidden MIRACLE.  There's nothing to the left, so continue
down the path to a room with a chest which contains a DAZE RING (equip on
Aguro, DFP+8, MGR+4).  Although Aguro has the best defense, his magic
resistance is pitiful and can use all the help it can get.  Leave the room and
take the path to the left to the stairs to the next floor.

If Lufia has not reached Level 7 yet (which she should w/o level-grinding),
then make sure to finish it off, so that she can learn Strong.  Head left to
the stairs to reach the island where you will find the Maberia.  You will want
to restore everyone to max HP with Potions before approaching it.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Goblin x3
HP: 125 ea.
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Hopefully, you will have picked up some Mid Arrows from those Kobolds
earlier.  If so, have the Hero and Aguro use them on the Goblins until you
exhaust your supply, when they should start attacking.  Meanwhile, Lufia should
be casting Dew in the first round, then Strong on whoever needs it in each
subsequent round.  If necessary, you can have the Hero join in the healing too,
but I'd like to take down at least one of the Goblins before doing so.  Taking
one of them down early makes the rest of the fight a lot easier.
*******************************************************************************

Afterwards, you'll return to Treck.  Rest up at the inn, then head left to the
pub.  Go upstairs and talk to the captain of the Maberia to head to Lorbenia.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Short Sword, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Sandal
Aguro: Short Sword, Cloth Armor, Cloth Helm, Cloth Shoes, Daze Ring

Upon your arrival, walk around to the right to get to the upper plateau of the
main part of the village.  In the lower right corner of the village is where
you can rest at the inn, for future reference.  The to the left, in the middle
of town is the shopping center.  Behind the weapon/armor shop sign, you can
find a hidden MIND POTION.  In the lower left corner of the village are the
equipment shops.  Between them is a bookshelf which contains a MID ARROW.

To progress with the plot, head to the shopping center.  Take the stairs up to
the second floor and in the lower right corner, you'll find a chest which
contains SWEET WATER.  Climb the stairs up to the third floor.  Talk to the
stationary blond woman at the middle of the floor.  Afterwards, return to the
inn to talk to the innkeeper, but you don't have to stay there.  Now, leave the
inn and Aguro will rejoin you.

If you're not doing any level-grinding (which you shouldn't need to do), then
you probably don't have enough money to buy all of the equipment I recommended
above.  Just buy the cheaper items first, for now.  They sell the same
equipment at the next town, where you'll be able to complete your purchases.
I don't recommend buying Cloth Shoes or a Tan Shield for the Hero and Aguro,
respectively, since you'll find them soon.

Our next destination is Grenoble.  To get there, follow the grassy plains
south, then straight west.  Of the new enemies, Mini Demons can cast Flash, so
you'll want to take them out quickly.  Roozards give a lot of gold for
defeating them, and aren't that hard to defeat either.  Rat can summon other
Rats to help them out, but aren't tough to handle.

Most people here don't have any useful information, but they do talk a lot
about this Old Cave, where you can find some spectacular treasure.  The inn is
in the lower left corner of town.  Check out the weapon shop and examine the
bookshelf which contains a POTION.  Above that shop is the armor shop.

Walk around to the upper left house, where you should pay the man 50 Gold to
learn about "the rumor".  Examine the bookshelf behind him which contains a
SPEED POTION (save for later).  Follow the secret passage around to the back of
town where you can find a hidden SPELL POTION in the flowers between the two
trees.  Go to the right to the steps to the Old Cave shop.

An old man here says he knows what you came here for, but wants something in
exchange that can be found at the Old Cave.  The way the Old Cave works is it
is composed of 7 floors.  In order to access the second floor, at least one
character in your party needs to be at Level 5.  For each subsequent floor you
want to access, you need a character with 5 more experience levels.  Talk to
the man behind the counter to receive your first task in the Old Cave.  Upon
completing the task, you can get your reward from the woman behind the counter.

I simply listed the same equipment purchases above for ease of reference.
Don't worry if your setup doesn't match mine listed below.  By the time we're
done with the Old Cave, we'll have more than enough money to buy everything we
need.  After resting at the inn, leave town, and cross the bridge to the island
to the west, where you can enter the Old Cave.

There's a lot of treasure to be found here.  The man at the counter will tell
you how to get down to the 2nd Level in the elevator in the back.  Just so you
know, I've listed all of the empty chests, because they contribute towards your 
treasure total in the game for some God-forsaken reason.

On the second level, the chest to the right is empty and the one to the left
contains a HI MAGIC.  Walk around to the next chest which contains a POTION.
The chest at the intersection contains an ANTIDOTE.  Take the lower path to two
chests which are empty.  Cast Float, then go straight down from the chest on
the right to find a hidden EX POTION.  Down the hall, open the three remaining
chests which are empty, contain a POTION, and SLEEP ARROW (save for later).
In the room, open the chests which contain a POWER RING (equip on Hero, ATP+10)
and SECRET MAP.

Return to the intersection and head right to another one.  Two of the chests
are empty, while the other two contain a FLOAT and CLOTH SHOES (equip on Hero).
First, head down, use the Float item you just found, and open the two chests
which contain a TAN SHIELD (equip on Aguro) and Dragon Egg.  Then, go up from
the intersection to find the room where only Lufia can move on ahead.  Inside,
are five chests which contain a DRESS, HAIR BAND, HEELED SHOES (save for
later), EARRING, and FAIRY KISS.

Return to the Old Cave shop to get your rewards.  Give the Old Man the Fairy
Kiss to receive a LETTER and to learn that you must head to the Northwest Tower
next.  Also, exchange the Secret Map you found for 500 GOLD from the lady
behind the counter.  If you're at Level 10, you could go down to the third
level of the
Old Cave, but I'm not, so we'll save that for later.

Sell your excess equipment, except for the Heeled Shoes, and purchase the
remaining equipment that you could not before.  Rest up at the inn, then leave
for the Northwest Tower.  Walk around the swamp to the west and cross the
bridge.  Then, go straight north until you reach the tower.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Short Sword, Tan Armor, Tan Shield, Tan Helm, Cloth Shoes, Power Ring

NORTHWEST TOWER [NWTW1]
Recommended Level: 9
Treasure: Sonic Ring, Hi Potion, Hi Magic, Smoke Ball, Mind Gourd, Power Gourd, 
     Hi Potion, Revive, Mind Potion, Great Potion, Power Potion, Spell Potion,
     Mid Arrow x2
Enemies: Fight (Thunder), Giant Newt (Fire), Goblin, Huge Bunny,
     Mini Crab (Thunder), Mini Demon, Rat, Red Magi, Roozard, Zombie
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Fight has a bit more HP, but is susceptible to Lufia's
Flash spell.  Watch out for Red Magi, which can cast Dew, Spark, & Magic Mirror
to devastate your party, so take them out quickly.  Zombies have the most HP
and probably can't be one-shot, so you may want to have Lufia cast Dew against
groups of 3+ of them.  This is a fairly long dungeon.  If you run low on MP,
don't be afraid to use a Hi Magic, as you'll find one and Red Magi drop them.
Also, don't walk over the edge of the tower, unless you want to leave quickly.

Start by taking the path to the left.  At the fork, enter the room with a chest
which contains the SONIC RING (equip on Lufia, DFP+1, AGL+5).  Ignore the upper
path at the fork, and go right from the entrance.  There are stairs above you,
but first check out the room to the right with two chests which contain a HI
POTION and HI MAGIC.  Now take the stairs up to the second floor.

Below you is a chest which contains a SMOKE BALL.  Walk around to the lower
left corner to some stairs that will take you to an isolated section of the
third floor.  Along the narrow path are three rooms with four chests which
contain a MIND GOURD, POWER GOURD, HI POTION, and REVIVE.

Return to the second floor, go up through the door, right and down through the
door, ignore the steps back to the first floor, and through the right door
instead.  Along the path, the first door on your right will lead to stairs to
the next floor, but pass it up for now.  Instead, head down to two rooms with
two chests which contain a MIND POTION and GREAT POTION.  Now head back to the 
stairs up to the main section of the third floor.

To your left are the stairs to the next floor, but pass them up for now.
Follow the path through a couple rooms to two chests which contain a POWER
POTION and SPELL POTION.  Return to the stairs that will take you to the fourth
floor.

Before entering the room, walk around to the back to find two chests which
contain 2 MID ARROW.  Then, give the Sonic Ring to the Hero, use a Hi Magic if
necessary, and enter the room to find the one you're looking for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Apprentice
HP: 313
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Immediately start the battle by using the Sleep Arrow to try to put
him to SLEEP!  If you're lucky, this will keep him down for awhile.  Whether it
worked or not, use a Power Gourd on yourself and cast Drain on him.  Then,
attack when you can and cast Strong when your HP drops below 60 or use a Hi/Ex
Potion to restore your HP to max, if you're below 40.  Eventually, your buff
and debuff will wear off, when you should start using those Mid Arrows to
finish him off.
*******************************************************************************

After defeating him, he will tell you that you need to go to Elfrea to find
Artea.  If you have some leftover MP, try walking out of the tower for the
experience.  Otherwise, just leap off the north end of the tower to exit and
return to Grenoble.  By now, you should easily be at Level 10, so sell your
excess equipment, and rest up at the inn.  Get your task from the Old Cave shop
and let's check out the Old Cave again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Frogs can cast Dew and are resistant to Water themselves.
Dracu Rose can poison you as well, but can drop Hi Arrows.

In the first room on the 3rd Level are five chests which contain a HI POTION,
BOMB, EMPTY, SOUR CIDER, and MAGIC GUARD.  Enter the next room and open the
first two chests which are empty and contain an ESCAPE.  Check out the room
above with two chests which are empty and contain a REVIVE.  In the previous 
room, head to the right to find two more chests which are also empty.  Continue
through to the main room.

Open the first chest which is empty.  To the right is another chest which
contains a SMOKE BALL.  From the left side of that chest, cast Float and walk
down to find a hidden MIRACLE.  In the lower right corner of the plateau is an
empty chest.  To the left is another chest which contains SWEET WATER.  Climb
down the ladder to two chests which contain a FLOAT and HI ARROWS.  Walk around
the swamp and follow the straight-forward path, opening two chests along the 
way which contain a HI MAGIC and HI POTION.  Then, enter the next room.

Open the six chests here which contain a BRONE BREAST (equip on Lufia), APRON,
BRONE HELM (equip on Hero), REVIVE, BROAD SWORD (cursed, sell), and empty.
Finally, check out the back room with five chests.  Two of which are empty, but
the others contain SPIKE SHOES (DFP+5, ATP+5, equip on Aguro), WATER RING
(boosts water damage, equip on Lufia), and SILVER WICK.

Return to the Old Cave Shop to receive your reward of 1000 GOLD.  When you're
ready, sell your excess equipment, rest up at the inn, and let's continue our 
adventure.  To move on, head back towards the Northwest Tower, except instead 
of going all the way north, walk around the western mountains and head
southwest across a few bridges.  You could visit a shrine to the north which
can warp you to the shrine by Alekia, but there's no real reason to do so.
Continue south to a village to make a pit stop.

Inn - 20

People here talk about a ghost haunting the cave to the north, but someone is
guarding the entrance, so I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.  Right by
the entrance is the inn, where you should head to the back and examine all of
the bookshelves to find a MID ARROW, HI ARROWS, and BOMB.  From the entrance,
walk straight up to a house where you should examine the bookshelf which
contains a PLUM CIDER.

Finally, visit the upper right house.  Examine the first two bookshelves which
contain a HI POTION and SWEET WATER.  Continue on back to meet Reyna and Mark,
who have a problem on their hand.  Examine both bookshelves by the bed which
contain a STUFFED PIG and STUFFED DOG.  If you don't do this now, you won't be 
able to later.  Afterwards, rest up at the inn and continue your journey east
to the castle Medan, Mark's home.

As usual, the inn is right by the entrance.  To the left is the item shop,
where you should buy some Mystery Pins, as they can cure the paralysis that
Spike Newt can inflict upon you.  In the lower right house of the village are
two bookshelves which contain a SWING WING and ESCAPE.  Above that house are
the equipment shops where you should make the recommended purchases listed
above.

I'm skipping on buying a Chain Cloth for Lufia and Wood Shield for Aguro, since
you'll be finding them in the next dungeon anyway.  Bombs are very useful right 
now, as they can hit all enemies for about 35-40 damage, so save them for such 
situations.  There's another hidden item here, but we can't get it yet, so walk
straight up the middle of the town to reach the Castle Medan.

To the left of the entrance are some flowers.  In the upper left corner of the
flowers, you can find a hidden EX POTION.  On the other side of the entrance,
in the upper right corner of the flowers, you can find a hidden EX MAGIC.
Then, enter the castle.

Head straight up to find the Hope Ruby and learn more about it from the people.
To advance the plot, leave the room, then head right to the steps to the 
basement.  Walk to the end of the hall to overhear a couple of people talking.
You can talk to the others around the castle, but there's no more treasure.

Now, leave the castle and return to Kirof.  After some automatic dialogue, rest
up at the inn and head north to the Ghost Cave.

Enemies: Crazy Pot, Flamespook (Frost/Water), Ghost Mail, Swordspook, Willowisp
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The is the first dungeon where creature types become important.  Every enemy
here is a "ghost" type enemy (duh, it's the Ghost Cave).  Here, you will find
an item that will greatly increase your damage against Ghosts.  From now on, 
I'll tell you which enemies are ghosts, so you can keep that in mind for later.

Of the new enemies, Crazy Pots can cast Frost, while Flamespooks can cast
Spark, so take care of them quickly.  Willowisps have high physical defense, so
you'll need to either Dew or a Bomb to take care of groups of them.  Don't 
worry about your MP here, because there's a healing tile with easy access, plus
Crazy Pots drop Magic Jars.  Swordspooks may rarely drop a Scimitar for the
Hero or Aguro, while Ghost Mail may rarely drop a Light Armor for them too.

Let's clear out most of the first floor first.  Go southeast to the first chest
which contains a HI POTION.  Head right past the first ladder and take the
second ladder down.  Walk counter-clockwise around the large room until you can
enter the first room with a chest which contains a MONSTER RING (sell).  Move
on to the room to the right with a chest which contains the GHOST RING
(attacks deal more damage vs. Ghosts, equip on Hero).  Hand down the Hero's
Power Ring to Aguro.

In the lower right corner of the outer room is a chest which contains 500 GOLD.
Above that is another room with a chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Walk
clockwise around that room, up the ladder, and into the upper right room with a
chest which contains a CHAIN CLOTH (equip on Lufia).  Head left to the next 
room with a chest which contains an ESCAPE.  Outside the room, climb down the 
first ladder you passed up to the lower left to the steps to the next floor.

Open the chest you see which contains a REVIVE.  The two tiles here will
restore your HP and MP, so remember where they are.  Take the lower set of
steps first to a narrow hallway with a chest which contains a WOOD SHIELD
(equip on Aguro).  Continue to the right to the stairs which lead to a chest
which contains a HI MAGIC.  Return to the healing tiles, then climb down the
upper steps and up the next stairs.

Below is a chest which contains a HI MAGIC.  Go through the hall via the upper
steps to eventually reach a chest which contains a DRAGON EGG.  Return back two
rooms and take the lower stairs to go forward two room to a chest which
contains a SPEED POTION (save for later).  Backtrack to the healing tiles for
the last time, and return to the first floor.  Climb the ladder and walk
clockwise down the narrow plateau to a room with a chest which contains a
REVIVE.  Then, head down the stairs to the next floor.

Go down to a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Walk straight to the right to
the next chest which contains another HI POTION, but don't go down the ladder
yet.  Then, head to the upper right corner to find a chest which contains yet
another HI POTION.  From the last chest, climb down the ladder, head to the
right, past the stairs and into the room.  Take the upper right steps first.

First, open the two chests which contain a SPELL POTION and POWER POTION.  The
rooms above each have a chest which contains a GREAT POTION and MIND POTION.
If you care, you can heal up a wounded knight in the upper left room who will
tell you "things are not what they appear to be."  Thanks.  Might as well tell 
me "Go to the next room."  Go back up the stairs and take the other set of
steps down this time.

Walk down to five sets of stairs.  Take either of the upper two down to two
chests which contain an ESCAPE and SMOKE BALL.  Either of the two bridges will
collapse if you try to cross them.  Instead, return back a floor, then take the 
lower center steps down.  Walk straight up across an invisible bridge to the
final chest which contains a REVIVE.  Heal everyone up to maximum and enter the
room above to find who you are looking for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Phantasm
HP: 657
WEAKNESS: Ghost Ring
STRATEGY: Aguro and the Hero should each use a Power Gourd, while Lufia casts 
Drain in the first round.  While the guys attack in each subsequent round,
Lufia should either cast Strong to heal, use a Shriek if one of your party
members gets confused, or cast Waken if they are put to sleep.
*******************************************************************************

After defeating the Phantasm, you automatically return to Kirof and are
directed to your next destination.  Talk to the item shop owner who will reward
you with a POWER POTION.  Rest up at the inn, and return to Medan.

While the princess is apologizing to her subjects, everyone is out of their
homes, so let's raid them while they're away.  There's only one thing you can
get and that's in the upper left house.  Examine the bookshelf which contains
a HI POTION. If you don't now, you will never be able to get it later.  

There is the Medan Mine to the north, but there's nothing useful there for now,
anyway, so I'd recommend going there later.  Instead, the princess says that
she's opened the path to the east, which coincides with your next destination.
Head northeast to the passage there.

There's nothing special here, so I'm not going to create a totally new section
for this.  Head right to the fork, cast Float, and continue right over the
swamp to two chests which contain a REVIVE and HI POTION.  Back at the fork,
go up past the guards and along the path to the other side of the cave.  Then,
walk south to the village of Belgen.

Apparently, the people here have problems of their own.  You can rest up at the
inn to the left of the entrance, if you ever need to.  There's only one person
you need to talk to here.  Head to the church in the upper right.  Then, go
into the cave in the upper left corner outside.  Open the two chests which
contain a FLOAT and HI POTION.  Continue to the back and examine the
bookshelves which contain a POWER GOURD and MIND GOURD.  One of the girls here 
will tell you about their situation and you should agree to help.

From the entrance, you can head up to the village hall, and the armor shop to 
the left.  In the village hall, examine the two bookshelves which contain a
REVIVE and HI MAGIC.  I don't recommend buying any weapons or more armor than
I've listed above, because you will either find more or buy better in the near
future.

We're supposed to go to a cave to the southwest first, but let's go east
instead to buy some much better equipment.  There's some more advanced enemies
than what you're expected to handle right now, but there's nothing special
about them.  Just make sure to keep your HP at max after every battle and
you'll be fine.

The inn is right at the entrance there.  In the upper right house, examine the
two bookshelves which contain a MIRACLE and HI MAGIC.  To the left is a strip
mall with a chest which contains a HI POTION.

Now THIS is what I'm talking about.  Great weapons, and even items that deal
far more damage at this point in the game.  Save Big Arrow for bosses, Hi
Arrows for groups of enemies, and Bombs for battles with many different types
of enemies.  I don't recommend purchasing a Brone Armor, Shield, or Helm for
Aguro, since we will find them in the near future.  With your new weapons, you 
should be able to one-shot any ghost-type enemies, so sell the Ghost Ring,
equip Aguro with the Daze Ring, and equip the Hero with the Power Ring

When you are ready, return to Belgen and rest at the inn.  Then, head south
until you find a bridge, and continue to the cave.  Along the way, Mummies can
confuse you and put you to sleep, while Poison Rats can poison you (duh).  Even
though you've got better armor, the enemies are starting to hit a lot harder,
so pay even more attention to keeping your HP up.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Axe, Brone Armor, Brone Shield, Brone Helm, Tan Shoes, Power Ring
Aguro: Axe, Chain Mail, Wood Shield, Wood Helm, Spike Shoes, Daze Ring

Enemies: Beetle (Ice), Blue Wolf, Ghost Mail, Killer Bee (Ice), Mud Man,
     Mummy (Fire), Poison Rat, Swordspook
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This cave should be relatively simple.  Head left to the steps to the next
floor.  Remember the first fork up ahead.  First, go down to the lower left
room with a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Then, take the lower middle
steps to two chests which contain a SMOKE BALL and FLOAT.  Return to the last 
floor, then take the lower right steps to an isolated section of that floor.

Above is a chest which contains an ESCAPE.  Follow the path to the left to two
more chests which contain a POWER POTION and SPELL POTION.  In the swamp at the
end, use a Float and search for a hidden MIRACLE.  Now, return to the
aforementioned fork, and go through the left door.

Follow the straight-forward path to the steps to the next floor.  In the nearby
swamp, there is a hidden SCIMITAR in the middle of it.  From this four-way
intersection, take the upper steps to two chests which contain a REVIVE and FLY
RING (sell).  Back at the intersection, enter the left room with two chests
which contain a HI MAGIC and HI POTION.  Return to the intersection, and check
out the right room with three chests which contain a BRONE ARMOR (equip on
Aguro), BRONE HELM (equip on Aguro), and BRONE SHIELD (equip on Aguro).

Finally, head down from the intersection to some steps to a path which will
lead you to a chest which contains the DAIS KEY.  Return to Belgen to sell your
excess equipment, restock on items, and rest at the inn.  At this point, I was
at Level 15, so let's head back to the Old Cave.  I'd recommend using a Swing
Wing to warp back to Grenoble.  Remember to get your task from the Old Cave
Shop before heading up to the Old Cave.

Enemies: Blue Wolf, Killer Bee (Ice), Mud Man, Orc, Red Orb
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
In your immediate vicinity, you will see three chests which contain a SMOKE
BALL, HI POTION, and is empty.  Head down, then left, picking up two chests 
along the way which contain 520 GOLD and is empty.  Then, enter the room in the 
lower left corner with nine chests which contain a LIGHT ARMOR (equip on Hero), 
WIND HEELS (sell), BUCKLER (equip on Hero), FLAME RING (save for later), LIGHT
ROBE (equip on Lufia), LONG SWORD (equip on Aguro), BRONE HELM, and two empty.

Leave the room then follow the upper left path, along the way picking up three
chests which contain a MAGIC GUARD and two are empty.  In the upper left room,
open the four chests which contain a MIRACLE and three are empty.

Finally, in the main area, along the lower right path are five chests which
contain a HI MAGIC, ESCAPE, LONG NAIL, FLOAT, and one is empty.  Use the Float,
find a hidden SPELL POTION in left side of the swamp, then pick up the last two
chests which contain a CROWN and BROAD ROD (cursed, sell).

Exchange the Crown to receive your reward of 2000 GOLD.  Use a Swing Wing to 
return to Belgen and your main quest.  Rest up at the inn, then leave town to
the west, this time hugging the coast.  To the northwest of the Southwest Cave,
you will find the cave to your next destination.

CAVE TO DAIS & DAIS [DAIS1]
Recommended Level: 16
Treasure: Great Potion, Mind Potion, Speed Potion, Float, Hi Magic, Revive,
     Mind Gourd, Power Gourd, Spell Potion, Power Potion
Enemies (cave): Beetle (Ice), Mimick, Mummy (Fire), Orc, Red Orb
Enemies (Dais): Beetle, Mummy (Fire), Poison Rat, Sand Man (Water),
     Sand Rose (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
As with the Dragon Quest series, Mimicks are Lufia's equivalent that give a ton
of experience, but has a high chance of running away when their HP gets low, so 
make sure to kill them quickly to reap the rewards.  Magic is also largely
ineffective against them.

Follow the path past the door until you reach three chests which contain a
GREAT POTION, MIND POTION, and SPEED POTION.  Return to the door and use the
Dais Key to proceed further.  Walk to the main area where you will find a swamp
and should enter the nearby room.

Climb down the ladder to a chest which contains a FLOAT.  Go down, out of the
room and along the path to two chests which contain a HI MAGIC and REVIVE.
Return to the swamp, climb down the first ladder, then down the next one to the
right to two chests which contain a MIND GOURD and POWER GOURD.  Cross the
bridge to the left, and walk under the next one to the last two chests which
contain a SPELL POTION and POWER POTION.

Walk around counter-clockwise up the ladder.  Follow the path across the bridge
to the left to exit the cave and reach the Dais.

Climb the stairs and around either side of the Dais.  There are HP and MP
restoring pots here that you should use.  Attempt to leave the Dais and the
plot will continue.  One of the guards will direct you to the North Tower which
is north of the Dais.

NORTH TOWER [NRTR1]
Recommended Level: 16
Treasure: Revive, Awaken, Antidote, Hi Potion, Shriek, Stone Cure, Mystery Pin,
     Flash Ring, Miracle, Miracle
Enemies: Archer (Thunder), Nightmare, Orc, Red Orb, Skeleton, Straw Man (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Archers are extremely deadly, as they can hit your entire
party with Hi Arrows.  Nightmares can inflict confuse, while Straw Man can
inflict paralysis, so deal with them before other enemies.  There are a lot of
warp points in this tower, many of which lead in circles, so I will simply
direct you to the correct ones.

From the entrance, walk up to the first warp point, and continue up to the
stairs to the second floor.  See the slightly discolored tiles?  Remember
these, as that will help you soon.  Walk toward the lower right corner of the
room to the stairs to the third floor.  There are many hidden pitfalls on this
room.  Here's a map to help you out.

 -----------
| X       CX|     LEGEND
| C  X    X |     X = Pitfall
|      C    |     C = Chest

|  XC     C |

|           |
 -----------

Maneuver around the hidden pitfalls to reach the seven chests which contain a
REVIVE, AWAKEN, ANTIDOTE, HI POTION, SHRIEK, STONE CURE, and MYSTERY PIN.
Return to the first floor and enter the upper right room.  Use the warp point
and take the stairs to the second floor.

Walk down to the first room below with a chest which contains the almighty
FLASH RING (boost thunder damage, equip on Lufia forever).  Leave the room,
then continue through the hall to the stairs to the third floor.  Keep climbing
three more staircases to reach the roof of the North Tower.

Be careful not to fall off the edge here.  Head to the leftmost warp point to a
chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Warp back, and go up to three warp points at
the top.  Take the left one and each subsequent one on that path to a chest
which contains another MIRACLE.  Return to the floor, then use the rightmost
warp point to find what you are looking for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Follower
HP: 982
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Aguro and the Hero should each use a Power Gourd in the first round,
while Lufia casts Drain.  The only real danger is if he manages to put you to
sleep with Drowsy, although Lufia has the Awaken spell to counter it.
Eventually, you may need to have Lufia heal with Stronger, but this is a pretty
easy boss fight.
*******************************************************************************

Afterwards, you supposedly get a Miracle as a reward, but it doesn't get added
to your inventory.  Now, the plot directs you to Surinagal, so let's head back 
there now.  You can sell your old Water Ring now and restock on Big Arrows.
The people at tell you where you need to go next.  Head southwest, cross the
bridge, then west to the Lost Forest Guide Station.

Inside the house, examine the three bookshelves which contain a REVIVE, SWEET
WATER, and SWING WING.  Talk to the old man to learn how to proceed through the
next area.  To help you on your way, you will finally recruit Jerin, your final
party member.

First, give Jerin all of your Speed Potions, as she will need them the most.
Then, equip her with the Heeled Shoes and Flame Ring.  Her usefulness is in
weakening groups of enemies.  Although she can equip Lufia's weapons, she is
best left with a bow, which can hit an entire group at once.  Her Spark spell
is fire-elemental and also hits groups, while her Frost spell hits all enemies.
Don't worry about her empty equipment slots for now, as we'll get upgrades for
her soon.  When you're ready, leave the station and head south the Lost Forest.

As you walk through the forest, Jerin will give you directions.  Simply follow
her guidance and you will quickly reach the other side.  There's a house where 
you can rest to the southwest, if you care.  Otherwise, head east to a shrine.
Pass on through to the other side.  Finally, walk northeast to reach Jenoba.

Make a pit stop at the inn to the right.  Above is a house with two bookshelves
which contain a BOMB and HI ARROWS.  To the left of the entrance are the 
equipment shops.  Walk around up to the item shop where you should now need to 
buy some Stone Cures.  Also, examine the bookshelf which contains a HI POTION.
Around the back of the item shop is some sand where you can find a hidden
MIRACLE.  Up on the hill to the right, walk around the left side of the house
and the tree to find a hidden MIND POTION.

The people here will tell you about the region, the three towers, and how to
get to your next destination.  Some of them will ask you to buy cider, which
you should do every time until they tell you what you need to know.

Leave town and let's go to the Blue Tower to the southeast.  Of the new
enemies, Chomp Weeds can inflict confuse, so make sure to finish them quickly.

The enemies here are particularly annoying.  Dark Elves, Frogs, & Jellybeans
all have multi-targeting spells.  Not to mention Dark Elves can inflict sleep, 
Gargoyles can inflict petrify, and Horroquins can inflict confusion and sleep.
Keep your HP high and don't be afraid to use those Big Arrows.

The middle room is empty, so let's take the left path to a room with a chest 
which contains the BLUE RING (equip on Hero, ATP+10, DFP+8).  Leave the room 
and walk up to the stairs to the second floor.

Go left and all the way down, past a fork, to a chest which contains a SWEET
WATER.  If you care, there is a tablet in the upper left corner of this floor
that will give you some more information about the region.  Fall off the side
of the tower and re-enter.  This time, head right to a room with a chest which
contains a MAGIC GUARD.  Leave the room and continue up to the stairs to the
other side of the second floor.

Climb the lower right stairs which leads to an isolated part of the third
floor.  Head left to a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Return to the
previous floor and walk along the perimeter to reach the stairs to the third
floor.

First, choose the left stairs to reach the fourth floor.  Follow the path to a
chest which contains a HI MAGIC.  Climb the stairs to the roof and make sure to
examine the pedestal, even though you can't do anything with it yet.

Return to the third floor, this time taking the right set of stairs.  Go into
the room and drop down the pit.  Open the chest which contains a REVIVE and
drop down the next pit. Open the last chest here which contains the GREEN JADE.

Leave the tower, return to Jenoba to sell your excess equipment and rest up at
the inn.  To reach the Green Tower, walk straight south of Jenoba, cross the
bridge, and hug the coast east to the tower.

Inn - 150

As we were told, there is an inn to the right, should you decide to need it, so
don't worry about conserving your MP.  First, enter the left room with a chest
which contains the GREEN RING (equip on Jerin, ATP+4, DFP+7, INT+4, AGL+10,
MGR+4).  From the entrance, walk up through the door to a hallway where you go
left to an isolated room.  Open the chest which contains a MAGIC GUARD and flip
the switch down.  Return to the hall and climb the right stairs this time to
the second floor.

The switch you flipped revealed the stairs on this floor.  Take the stairs to
the left to three chests which contains an EX POTION, REVIVE, and a useless 
broken red sapphire which might as well be empty.  Fall down the pit, and climb
the stairs below you to three chests which contain a HI MAGIC, REVIVE, and EX 
POTION.  Go down the pit again, and open the chest in the lower left corner
which contains a SWING WING.  Return to the switch room, flip it back up and 
return to the second floor here.

Head down to the stairs to the third floor.  Then, go up to the stairs to an
isolated room.  Offer the man 100 Gold for his information and return to the 
last floor.  Walk around to the opposite side of the floor and climb two sets
of stairs to the roof of the tower.  Makes sure to examine the pedestal, then
fall off the edge of the tower.

Instead of returning to Jenoba, we should continue on to the next town.  Walk
around the islands counter-clockwise across a bridge until you reach the
village of Ruan.

house are two more bookshelves which contain a SWEET WATER and REVIVE.

Check out the field in the lower right corner of the village.  Search the 
center of the patches of blue flowers to find a hidden POWER POTION and EMPTY 
BOTTLE. In the upper right house is a bookshelf which contains an EMERALD.

The people here will tell you about the problems the village is facing.  Talk
to the Jeweller in the upper right house to learn how you can find a Ruby for

Talk to the old man who will give you the RED SAPPHIRE.  Now, you can enter the

EMERALD.  Leave the cave, warp back to Ruan, rest at the inn, and head west to
the Red Tower.

RED TOWER [REDT1]
Recommended Level: 19
Treasure: Hi Potion, Red Ring, Spell Potion, Power Potion, Float, Power Gourd, 
     Magic Guard, Hi Magic, Hi Potion, Smoke Ball, Magic Guard, Hi Potion,
     BLUE JADE, Dragon Egg, Miracle
Enemies: Big Meany, Flamefreak, Flamespook (Frost/Water), Gargoyle (Fire),
     Horrorquin
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Big Meany and Flamefreak are quite dangerous with their Bang
and Flame spells.  They also have a lot of HP, so coordinate your attacks well.

There are four paths to choose from, so let's take them from left to right.
The first path leads to some stairs to an isolated room with two chests which
contain a HI POTION and RED RING.  Return to the entrance and take the second 
path to a swampy basement.  Cast Float to navigate around to the other two
raised platforms with two chests which contain a SPELL POTION and POWER POTION.
Make sure to get these now or you won't be able to do so later.

Back at the entrance, take either of the remaining paths to the stairs to the 
second floor.  Climb the nearby stairs and examine the wall to your left to
learn what you need to do next.  Go back and enter the nearby room with a chest
which contains a FLOAT.  From the steps, follow the left path to a room with
two chests which contains a POWER GOURD and MAGIC GUARD.

From the four-way intersection, head down and right at the fork to two chests
which contain HI MAGIC and HI POTION.  Climb the nearby stairs to an isolated
room with two chests which contain a SMOKE BALL and MAGIC GUARD.  Return to the 
fork on the previous floor and enter the room to the left to the stairs to the 
third floor.

Climb the nearby stairs to find a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Go back 
down and follow the path around the perimeter to the stairs to the fourth
floor.  Finally, walk around to the stairs to the roof where you will find the
root of the problems in the region.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Dark Ghost
HP: 934
WEAKNESS: Thunder
STRATEGY: Sadly, despite being called Dark Ghost, it is neither considered to
be a ghost or flying, but rather undead, which you cannot exploit, so Lufia
should be casting Flash every round.  During the first round, the Hero should
cast Drain, Aguro should attack, and Jerin should use a Power Gourd on Aguro.
In the second round, both guys should attack, while Jerin uses a Power Gourd on
the Hero.  Jerin should focus on healing from there, as needed, even though the 
Dark Ghost's spells are not that threatening.
*******************************************************************************

For defeating the Dark Ghost, you will have removed the swamp.  Jump off the
edge of the tower and re-enter.  Head down to the basement through the second 
path from the left to find three new chests which contain the BLUE JADE, DRAGON
EGG, and MIRACLE.  Now that we have all of the jewels, we need to put them
where they belong.  Walk back to Jenoba, rest up at the inn, and go southeast
to the Blue Tower.

Follow the right path to the stairs to the second floor.  Walk clockwise around
the tower, past the first stairs, to the other flight of stairs to the third
floor.  Take the left stairs to the fourth floor, and the rest is straight-
forward to the roof where you should place the Blue Jade on the pedestal.  Warp
back to Jenoba and rest up at the inn.  To reach the Green Tower, walk straight
south of Jenoba, cross the bridge, and hug the coast east to the tower.

Walk up to the long hallway and take the right stairs to the second floor.
Then, head down to the stairs to the third floor.  Go down again to the stairs
to the fourth floor.  The rest is straight-forward to the roof where you should
place the Green Jade on the pedestal.  Warp back to Ruan, rest up at the inn,
and head west to the Red Tower.

Enter the either door on the right to reach the stairs to the second floor.
Head down to the fork and into the left room to the stairs to the third floor.
Walk counter-clockwise around to the stairs to the fourth floor.  The rest of
straight-forward to the roof where you should place the Red Sapphire.  Jerin
will learn the Elf spell which is the only way to warp to Elfrea.

Apparently, the elves really like you here, because they let you rest up at the
inn for free.  In the middle of the flowers to the left, you can find a hidden
SPELL POTION.  At the equipment shop above the inn, I don't recommend buying 
too much, because you are going to find a lot more stuff soon.

In the large house above are two chests which contain a SPEED POTION and MIND
POTION.  The right stairs lead to a portal, but the door is locked, so take the
left stairs to finally speak with Artea.  He will give you the SHRINE KEY to
open the door earlier and tell you what you need to do next.  While you are
leaving Artea will give Jerin his old ARTEA'S BOW (equip on Jerin).  However,
you should definitely save her Elven Bow for later.

At this point, you should be at Level 20, so with our new equipment, let's
return to the Old Cave and make a pit stop at Grenoble.  Remember to get your 
task from the Old Cave Shop before heading up to the Old Cave.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Sting can poison you, but none of these guys are too hard.

From the entrance, walk down to two chests which contain a SMOKE BALL and is
empty.  In the room below you, open the five chests which contain a LUCK BLADE
(cursed), OPAL RING, EX POTION, and two are empty.  Head back to the last room,
cast Float, and search the upper tile of the lower two swamps for a chest which
contains an EX POTION.  Go right and up to find a chest which contains a KITE
SHIELD (equip on Hero), then enter the upper right room.

Open the three chests here which contain a HI BOMB, HI POTION, and is empty.
Go down the middle room to find three more chests which contain a SPELL POTION, 
REVIVE, and is empty.  Continue down to a room with four visible chests which
contain 500 GOLD, a FLOAT, and two are empty.  Use the Float, and from above
the chest where you found it, walk straight right to a hidden REVIVE in the
swamp.  Walk down to two chests which contain a POWER POTION and is empty.
Enter the room to your right.

There are three chests here which contain a BATTLE AXE (equip on Aguro), while
the other two are empty.  Head up to the next room with one chest which
contains a HI BOMB.  Finally, float across the swamp to the back room with five
chests which contain a MIRACLE, FROST RING (save for later), GOLDEN PAWN, and 
twp are empty.  Exchange the Golden Pawn to receive your reward of 3000 GOLD.

Warp back to Elfrea with Jerin's Elf spell, then rest up at the inn.  Return to 
Artea's house, this time going down the upper right steps.  You can now open 
the door to the warp point, which will take you to a shrine.  Leave the room,
then enter the other one to warp to the next continent.

To the west is a shrine that connects to the ones you've visited earlier, if
you care to unlock it.  Otherwise, from where you arrived, walk southeast to a
bridge.  Cross it through the desert to reach the town of Ranqs.

By the entrance, the inn is to the left and the equipment shop is to the right.
Again, I wouldn't buy more than I listed above, because we'll either find or 
buy better things before the next big dungeon anyway.  In the upper right part
of the village is a flower where you can find a hidden POWER POTION. Not too
much else is going on here.  Some people mention a cave to the east, so let's
check it out.

Outside the village, walk clockwise around the mountains to reach the Cave East
of Ranqs.  All that's interesting here is a chest which contains an ESCAPE.
Return to Ranqs, then head southwest to the Cave to Odel.

There's a room above that is very tricky to get through, with invisible walls
blocking your path.  Here's a map to help you get through.  Walk through in
numerical, then alphabetical order.

To the right of the entrance is the inn.  Above is the weapon shop and the
armor ship is to the left.  You'll now have the best equipment you can buy,
except for the items that you'll find in the beginning of the next cave.

Straight north of the entrance, cross the bridge, but head left before entering
the castle.  In the house, open the chest which contains an EX POTION.  Go
downstairs, examine the bookshelf, and open the chest which contain a MIRACLE
and EX MAGIC.  The people here tell you about the problem this village is
having and (you guessed it) you'll have to fix it to continue with the game.
Now, enter the castle.

To the right of the entrance are three groves of flowers.  In the center of 
each of them is are hidden SPEED POTION, MIND POTION, and GREAT POTION.  You 
could go left of the entrance to the laboratory, but let's save that for last.
For now, enter the castle proper.

Head up to the stairs, but walk around to the room to the back instead.
Examine the four dressers which contain two HI MAGIC, a POWER POTION, and SPELL 
POTION.  Return to the stairs and climb them to the throne room.  Talk to
Piron, who is standing next to the princess.  Agree to do a favor for him to 
advance the plot.

Walk back down outside the castle and head left down the steps.  Go down the
hall to reach Shaia Lab 2.  In the lower right corner, examine the lockers to
find a POWER GOURD and MIND GOURD.  Head down the lower right stairs and down
the hall to warp to another lab.

Head down to the four-way intersection.  Yes, I realize what this area looks
like (ignorant map designers).  The lower path just goes to the world map, so
let's take the upper path first to an isolate part of the Cave to Arus.  Open 
the two chests which contain a YELLOW RING (DFP+20, MDF+20!!!, equip on Aguro)
and STONE CURE.  Those stairs lead to the world map, so just return to the 
intersection and head left to reach the main lab.

Check out the lab to the left, enter it, and go down the stairs to the right.
Examine all four rows of lockers which contain a HI MAGIC, EX ARROWS, GLOOM
ARROW, and HI BOMB.

Go outside and Warp back to Odel.  To reach your next destination, walk
southeast, cross the bridge, and south to the end of the peninsula.  Of the new
enemies, Giant Oaks can put you to sleep and Pin Lizards can petrify you.
Watch out for Mimickers who have high DFP and MDF, but give a ton of
experience.  Have Jerin cast Confuse on them to try to keep them from running
away.  As you get closer to Lyden, Frogulas can poison you, Harpies can confuse
you, and Yeoman can use Hi Arrows.

The inn is to the right with a bookshelf which contains a SWING WING.  You can
find the man you're looking for in the house to the left.  Just talk to him and
he'll return to Odel.  Below you is a large plateau.  Walk around in counter-
clockwise until you can climb the stairs into the house.  Examine the two
bookshelves there which contain a GRILLED NEWT and STONE CURE.  In the kitchen, 
take the steps down to four chests which contain a STONE CURE, CHOP BLOCK,
SMALL KNIFE, and FRY PAN.

Now comes one of the most tedious escort quests I've ever seen in an RPG, even
though it'll be worth it.  Return to Odel and talk to Prion.  He will tell you 
to inspect the bridge before they set out.  After that, you have to return to
Odel to get Piron to go fix it.  Next, you have to go back to the bridge to
talk to Piron to progress with the plot.  Then, you have to walk ALL the way
around the cave to get on a cliff to INSPECT THEIR WORK?!  Finally, you can
walk back to the bridge and move along.

Get ready for a lot of walking.  After talking to Piron back at Odel, rest up
at the inn and cross the bridge to the west.  There are three entrances to the
Cave to Arus.  Walk north to the upper entrance first.

     Ice Snake (yes, they are weak to Ice, this is not a typo), Mimicker
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Blue Wisps have high defense, so cast Bang against them.
Crazy Jars can petrify and confuse you, so make sure you bring plenty of
Shrieks along.  Ice Snakes can put you to sleep, but for some reason are weak
to ice.  I'll be dividing the treasure hunting into three parts, so that you'll
be able to last through this long cave, because of all the backtracking.  I
wouldn't recommend using Escape, because you can always use more experience.

Walk southwest to a rope ladder which you should climb down and the next one to 
a chest which contains a HALF MAIL (equip on Aguro).  Head back up the ladders 
and open the nearby chest which contains a GLASS ROBE (mistranslation, equip on
Lufia as a weapon).  Climb down the ladder to your left, and continue left to a
chest which contains a STONE CURE.  Finally, go down to a ladder, and continue
down to two chests which contain a MIRACLE and QUILTED SILK (equip on Jerin).

Leave the cave the way you came in.  Go back across the bridge, except walk
around the lake clockwise to another bridge.  Follow the path there to the
other side of the cave.  Climb down two ladders, then head right to two chests
which contain a DRAGON EGG and EX POTION.  From the bottom of the ladders, walk 
left to check out the bridge.  Now, return to Odel to get Piron off his lazy 
butt and start fixing the bridge.  Rest up at the inn before leaving again.

Of course, he could actually fix the bridge for you, but instead he's going to
make you run around for awhile longer.  First, return to the bridge and talk to
Piron.  He will tell you to get on the cliff to the right to inspect his work.
To get there, return to the three cave entrances you saw before and take the
center one.

Walk around to a fork, where you should head down first.  It's a long walk, but
you'll find three chests along the way which contain a GLASS CAP, IRON HELM
(equip on Aguro), and WIND SHOES.  Step on the left side of the cliff to get
Piron moving finally, and he'll actually fix the bridge.  Return to Odel to
rest up at the inn and prepare for the final trek to Arus.

Make your way back to the repaired bridge.  Cross and go right to a fork, where
you should head up and around to two chests which contain an ESCAPE and HI 
ARROWS.  Take the right path from the fork around to the steps to a small room.
In the room above, you'll find a chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Continue up
to a room with stairs that you should climb back to the main cave area.

Open the nearby chest which contains a REVIVE.  Head left, past the ladder, and
down at the fork to a chest which contains an EX POTION.  Climb the ladder you 
passed up to find the last chest which contains a REVIVE.  Go left, up the
ladder, up the stairs to leave the cave, and north to the village of Arus.

Of the new enemies, Trap Harps can poison you, but have a ton of HP, which is
why I equipped Jerin with the Flame Ring.

There are six chests in the first room which contain three HI BOMBS, while the
others are empty.  Enter the left door first to a narrow plateau with seven
chests along the way.  The first is empty, but the rest contain a GLADIUS
(equip on Aguro), PLATE CLOTH (equip on Lufia), PLATE MAIL (equip on Hero),
POWER POTION, SPEED POTION, SPELL POTION.

Return to the first room and take the right door this time to a chest which 
contains an ESCAPE.  Climb down the ladder, cast Float, and open the two chests
in the swamp which contain an EX MAGIC and EX POTION.  From the right side of
the right chest, walk up to find a hidden MIRACLE.  From the fork above, head
along the right path to four chests which contain a PLATE HELM (equip on Hero),
REVIVE, while two are empty.  Go left from the fork to two more chests which
contain a HAMMER ROD (equip on Lufia), while the other is empty.

GOURD, EX MAGIC, EX POTION, KNIFE SHOES (ATP+10, DFP+5, equip on Aguro), NEEDLE
SHOES (ATP+10, DFP+2, equip on Jerin), while the other is empty.  Then, take 
the right stairs up to the final area.

Open the seven visible chests (foreshadowing) which contain a MIND GOURD, POWER
GOURD, MIRACLE GEM, and BLAST RING (save for later), while the other three are
empty.  From just below the left chest, walk straight down to the final hidden
chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Return to Grenoble to exchange the Miracle Gem
to receive your reward of 5000 GOLD.

Warp back to Arus, rest up at the inn, and head west to a tiny cave with the
same enemies as the Cave to Arus.  On the other side, you will eventually reach
the Tower of Grief.

     Yeoman (Thunder)

This tower is very easy and straight-forward.  From the intersection at the
entrance, go right to a chest which contains the PURPLE RING (ATP+10, DFP+11,
INT+4, AGL+2, MGR+5, equip on Hero).  Back at the intersection, enter the room
above and climb the stairs to find three chests which contain a DRAGON EGG,
REVIVE, and STONE CURE.  Drop down the pitfall, leave the room, and head left
to the stairs to the second floor.  Then, walk around the pitfall to the stairs
to the third floor.

The upper right stairs lead to two chests which contain a REVIVE and STONE
CURE.  The lower left stairs lead to two chests which contain a HI MAGIC and EX
POTION.  Take either of the remaining stairs to another set of stairs to the
fifth floor.  Here, you'll find HP and MP restoration tiles, but you won't need
them.  Just climb the stairs to the roof to find a chest which contains a
MIRACLE.

Talk to the old man, who will boost Lufia's MP by 10 and tell you that the man
you're looking for returned to the lab.  Fall off the edge of the tower and
warp to Platina.  Go upstairs to the right to finally meet Professor Raile
Shaia.  After a lengthy scene, you will finally procure your own ship, opening
up a world of possibilities.

First, we should follow his advice and head on over to Shaia Lab 3.  Equip
Jerin with the Flame Ring, as every enemy in the ocean is weak to fire.  Sail 
straight west of Platina to find another town on an island.

Recommended Level: 29
Treasure: Mind Potion
Enemies (Carbis): Blue Wisp, Crazy Jar, Ghoul, Giant Oak (Fire),
     Ice Snake (Ice), Pin Lizard (Ice)
Enemies (ocean): Harpie, Jelly Bolt (Fire), Killer Eel (Fire),
     Lobsteron (Fire), Psychoclam (Fire), Red Star (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
In the building, examine the locker to find a MIND POTION.  Head downstairs and
down the hallway to find Raile.  He will tell you to find someone at the 
village of Bakku to the west.  However, you should most definitely not go there 
first, because you will miss out on a very rare and powerful item if you do.

Instead, let's go exploring with our new ship.  The first thing I'd like to do
is visit all the towns in the world, so that we can easily warp to them, when
the plot directs us there.  If you really want, you could talk to the people at
these towns and collect the treasure there, but to avoid confusion, I'll simply
list all that when the plot will eventually take us to these towns, anyway.

First, sail straight north to Ring Island (it looks like a ring) where you will 
find the village of Soshette.  From the west side of the island, sail straight 
north for awhile to Frederia, Shaia Lab 4.

The best equipment that money can buy for a long time is sold at the equipment
shops to the right, and you should have plenty of it now, having not bought
anything for awhile.  I had about 100,000 Gold at this point.  If you don't,
it's not critical, but if you've fought every random battle to this point, you
should be able to set yourself up with this shopping list:

1 Grand Blade (equip on Aguro)
2 Carbo Plates (equip on Hero & Aguro)
1 Clear Silk (equip on Lufia)
2 Carbo Shields (equip on Hero & Aguro)
1 Carbo Helm (equip on Hero)
1 Carbo Cap (equip on Lufia)

If you had the money (which I didn't), I guess you could buy more, but you'll
eventually find another one of everything I didn't buy 2 of on this list.  The 
only exception is the Catwhip, which I didn't have the money for, but didn't
care either, since Lufia should hardly be attacking.  The Sword Shoes (for Hero
& Aguro) and Cat Heels (for Jerin) are also good buys too. I'll get them later.

When you're done there, sail west to some reef surround a village you cannot
yet reach.  Continue southwest past a small island to visit the village of
Epro.  From there, sail straight south to the village of Marse, where you'll
want to make another purchase.  To reach the equipment shop, head down the
steps to the basement, right to the fork, then down to the stairs where you 
should make the following purchase:

2 Silver Wrists (equip on Lufia & Jerin)

You'll find one later, but they're so cheap, I figured just buy it now.  When
you're ready, hug the coast west and down the river to the castle Herat.  Leave 
the river, then sail straight west until you hit land.  Hug the coast counter-
clockwise until you reach the end of the desert.  Finally, sail straight north 
to an island village that we really do want to explore.

This is a weird town.  From the entrance, walk around the outside of the walls
to the steps to the basement area.  Go down to the stairs to find a chest which
contains the MIND RING (INT+30, MGR+10, sell).

Return to the entrance and into the village.  In the upper left room, examine
the bookshelves which contain a HI POTION and HI MAGIC.  The shops here don't 
sell anything interesting, besides the Knife Shoes, but we're going to get
something better soon enough, anyway.  Climb the stairs on the upper wall to
the second floor.

The shop to the left sells everything that you have sold in the game, so if you
want something back, you can get it.  In the other shop, you will be forced to
buy something cheap and useless in order to be able to leave.  However, this
will also give you access to the bookshelves which contain a RIBBON and GOWN.
We're done here, so leave the village.

At this point, that's every town in the world that we can access except the one
that will advance the plot.  However, you don't want to go there yet, because
if you do, you will lose out on one of the best pieces of equipment in the
game.  Instead, we're going to sequence break by going to the next dungeon
first.

Warp back to Soshette and rest up at the inn.  From the southern edge of the
island, sail straight west until you find a shrine, which will connect to the 
other three shrines that you found earlier.  Walk straight west of the shrine
to find a tower in a canyon across a bridge.

TOWER OF LIGHT [TWRL1]
Recommended Level: 30
Treasure: Hi bomb, Ex Potion x2, Stone Cure, Power Potion, Spell Potion,
     Undead Ring, Sea Ring, Stone Cure, Revive, Ex Magic, Ex Potion, Revive,
     Ex Potion, Miracle, Gloom Voice, Might Helmet, Power Gourd, Great Axe,
     Large Shield, Plate Cap, Silver Robe
Enemies: Axe Knight (Thunder), Mad Lily (Fire), Terrorquin, Trap Harp (Fire),
     Werewolf, Zooster
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, watch out for Terrorquin and Zooster, which can confuse and
petrify you, respectively.  Mad Lillies and Trap Harps have a ton of HP, so
make sure to have Jerin cast Flame against groups of them.

Walk straight up into the pitfall to the basement, where you will find six
chests which contain a HI BOMB, 2 EX POTION, STONE CURE, POWER POTION, SPELL 
POTION.  Climb the stairs at the center of the basement to return to the first
floor.

Enter the lower left room and climb to sets of stairs to a dead-end.  Walk
around until you find a pitfall leading to a chest which contains the UNDEAD
RING (sell).  In the upper right corner is the pitfall to the basement.  Work
your way back to the entrance as before.  This time, enter the lower right room
and climb two sets of stairs to a dead-end.  Walk around until you find a
pitfall leading to a chest which contains the SEA RING (sell).  In the upper
left corner is the pitfall to the basement.

Return to the first floor, and head to either staircase in the upper left or
right corner to the second floor.  Go down to the room on the lower end of the
floor and enter to find a chest which contains a STONE CURE.  Then, take the 
nearby stairs to the third floor.

Head down to a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Walk towards the room to the
right, enter it, but do NOT walk straight up to the chests, or you will fall
down a pitfall.  Instead, sidestep it one to the left, then up to the two
chests which contain an EX MAGIC and EX POTION.  Go back to the stairs, then up
to the tiny room with a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Finally, climb the
stairs in the upper right corner to the fourth floor.

Go down to the next room and climb the first stairs you see.  Head right up to
a fork, where you should take the left path to a chest which contains a
EX POTION.  Enter the room back by the fork and climb those stairs.  Follow the
straight-forward path until you find a room with a chest.  Open it from the
left to find a MIRACLE.  Walk up from above the chest to drop down a pitfall to
the previous floor, and climb down the steps below.

This time, enter the room above you, and continue up to the next room and the
stairs to the fifth floor.  You can't get the center four chests yet, so climb 
the nearby stairs to the sixth floor.  Go left and down to the stairs to the
sixth floor.  From the upper side of it, open the nearby chest which contains a
GLOOM VOICE.

At the top of this floor are the stairs which eventually lead to the roof,
where you will find a chest which contains the MIGHT HELMET (DFP+35, INT+25,
MGR+19, equip on Jerin).  This is the only one in the game.  If you want until
later to come here, you can never get it.  For some reason, despite being a
men's helmet, Jerin can equip it as well, and she could really use the help on
the three incredible stat boosts.

Now go back three floors and enter the room in the lower right corner.  Climb
the stairs and from the left, open the chest which contains a POWER GOURD.
Drop down a hidden pitfall above the chest to an isolated room.  Walk around
until you find another hidden pitfall to the four chests which contain the
GREAT AXE (equip on Hero), LARGE SHIELD, PLATE CAP, and SILVER ROBE (equip on
Jerin).

Unfortunately, you will have to walk out of the tower, as Escape does not
work in towers, except on the roof.  Since you're within walking distance of
your next destination, walk south through the desert and across the bridge.
Continue south until you find the last village we hadn't visited yet.

In the house above you, examine all the bookshelves which contain an EX POTION,
EX MAGIC, and REVIVE.  You can walk around the back of the house to find the
inn.  The people here tell you about the Tower of Light, but not the man you're
looking for.  Climb down the steps left of the entrance.  Then, walk clockwise 
around the wall to find the town cleric.  He will tell you to go to the Old
Cave 5th Level.  Before heading there, you should have enough money from the
tower to buy a few more items back at Frederia.

1 Catwhip (equip on Lufia)
2 Sword Shoes (equip on Hero & Aguro)
1 Cat Heels (equip on Jerin)

Warp back to Grenoble and go down to the Old Cave 5th Level.  Walk right, into
the room, all the way to the right, down into the room, and across the swamp
into the final room, where you will find Cooper.  Jerin will cast Escape and
you should warp back to Carbis.  Head down to the basement and talk to Raile.
He will tell you to find 7 pieces of Alumina.  To get them you will need to
visit Brant at the village of Linze which is blocked off by the Tower of Light.

Since you should be over Level 30 by now, let's warp back to Grenoble, rest up 
at the inn, and get ready for another level of the Old Cave.  Remember to get 
your task from the Old Cave Shop before heading up to the Old Cave.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The enemies here hit very hard, so make sure to keep everyone within 30 HP of
their max.  Don't be afraid to use your Ex Magics or Miracles when you need
them.  Ignore the weaknesses to Ice, as even with the Frost Ring, Jerin's Frost
spell won't do that much.  Watch out for Mega Frogs, as they can cast Champion
to fully restore their HP.  Have Lufia cast Deflect against them to put a stop
to that.  Against groups of everything but Mad Wolves, have Jerin cast Confuse
and either the Hero or Lufia cast Fright to disable them long enough for the
others to finish them off.  Rock Golems can petrify you, Hydras can drop Might
Swords, and Mega Frogs can drop Miracles.  If she hasn't already, Lufia should
soon learn Blast, when she should equip the Blast Ring for massive damage.

Walk right to two chests which contain a SWEET WATER and is empty.  Cast Float
and continue right through the swamp to two chests which contain a GLOOM PICK 
and is empty.  On the right wall are two more chests which contain an EX POTION
and is empty.  Enter the room, cast Float, and search the upper right corner of
the swamp to find a hidden GLOOM VOICE.  Climb down the nearby stairs.

First, take the upper path to three chests which contain an EX MAGIC, POWER
POTION, and is empty.  In the upper left corner by the stairs are two chests 
which contain a SPELL POTION and is empty.  Climb the stairs to find two chests
which contain a BUSTER SWORD (equip on Hero) and is empty.  Enter the back room
with four chests which contain the CROWN JEWELS, 2 MIRACLES, and is empty.

Head back down the steps, this time taking the lower path to two chests which
contain a HI MAGIC and is empty.  Climb the stairs back to the main area and 
climb the nearby ladder to three chests which contain an EX POTION, FLOAT, and
is empty.  Enter the door to the wide open area.

Go right to a chest which contains a GREAT POTION.  First, take the right path 
down to three chests which contain a SPELL POTION, POWER POTION, and is empty.
Climb down the ladder to the right and around to two chests which contain an EX
MAGIC and is empty.  Use the Float and cross the swamp to the left to a chest
which contains a MIRACLE.  Take the stairs down to another basement area.

Open the two nearby chests which contain an EX POTION and is empty.  Continue
right past the fork to two more chests which are also empty.  Enter the room
above to find a chest which contains the WIND FLUTE, a very useful item that 
restores about 50 HP to everyone can be used infinitely for free.  Go back to 
the fork and head towards the upper right corner to a chest which contains a 
CLEAR SILK (equip on Jerin).  Climb the ladder to a chest which contains a
MIRACLE, then walk left to the stairs back to the main area.

First, open the nearby chest which is empty.  Climb down the ladder to another 
chest which contains a MIND POTION.  Finally, walk left to pick up the last
three chests which contain an ESCAPE and the rest are empty.  You can then walk
down to the door which will take you back to the entrance.  Return to Grenoble
to exchange the Crown Jewels to receive your reward of 10000 GOLD.

That's everything for the Old Cave for the remainder of the game.  Warp back to 
Bakku, rest up at the inn, and let's continue along our quest by returning to
the Tower of Light.  If you passed it up earlier, just walk north through the
desert, across the bridge, and continue until you see a tower across a bridge.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
If you haven't already been here before, you missed out on a Might Helmet.  See
the previous Tower of Light for details on how to collect that, all the 
treasure here, and how to deal with all the enemies.  This trip should be much
easier and my directions will simply take you straight to the end.  Don't
forget to use that Wind Flute to keep your HP up.

Head to either staircase in the upper left or right to the second floor.  Walk
around to the bottom room to find the stairs to the third floor.  Take the
stairs in the upper right corner to the fourth floor.  Go down out of the room,
left into the middle room, and up to the stairs to the fifth and sixth floors.
Continue left and down to the stairs to the seventh floor, then up and right to
the stairs that will eventually take you to the roof.  Temporarily equip Lufia
with her Flash Ring and talk to the man you're looking for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Guardian
HP: 1489
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Aguro and the Hero should attack every round.  During the first
round, Lufia should cast Drain, then Bolt in each subsequent round.  Jerin
should use Power Gourds on the Aguro and the Hero during her first two rounds,
then use the Wind Flute to heal from the Guradian's MT spells.  If you are
desperate for healing, you can cast Boost to heal everyone for more, but it
shouldn't matter.
*******************************************************************************

For defeating him, you get access to the chest which contains the LIGHT KEY.
Drop off the edge of the tower and re-enter.  This time, walk all the way 
around to the door at the upper wall, where you can pass through to the other 
side of the tower.  Follow the straight-forward path to reach Linze.

Rest up at the inn to the left.  The people here will tell you that Brant went
to the Gayas Island Cave.  To get there, you will need to go through the tunnel 
under his house.  Head up from the entrance to the upper plateau.  Between the 
equipment shops to the left, examine the bookshelf which contains an ESCAPE.
Brant's house is to the far right, where you should go down to the basement.

In the lower right corner, you can find a hidden EX MAGIC.  Take the next
stairs down.  At the fork in the hall, go down first to three chests which
contain a SWEET WATER, DRAGON EGG, and SWING WING.  Head right from the fork to

Start in the lower right corner and working your way around clockwise while
opening the eight chests which contain an EX BOMB, REVIVE, EX POTION, HI MAGIC,
STONE CURE, ESCAPE, EX BOMB, and EX POTION.  From just above the lower left
chests, walk straight right to intentionally fall down a pitfall.  Climb the
stairs to a chest which contains some ALUMINA.

Go back down the steps, cast Float, and walk to the ladder in the upper right.
Walk around clockwise to open the three chests which contain a DRAGON EGG, HI 
MAGIC, and EX BOMB.  Climb the stairs above back to the first floor.  Then,
head down the ladder to the lower level.

Head up and right to a ladder and into a hall which will lead to two chests
which contain an ESCAPE and MAGIC GUARD.  Return back down the ladder, walk
around to the three rooms below.  Enter the right door first and climb the
stairs to two chests which contain an EX MAGIC and EX POTION.  Then, take the
left door to a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Flip the switch in the center
room, which will change the destination of the warp point in the left room to a
chest which contains an EX POTION, and left to the steps to the next floor.

Open the chest to the left which contains an EX ARROWS.  From the steps, walk
right and up to a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Head down to the lower right
corner and enter the room with a chest which contains an EX POTION.  Take the
warp point to a chest which contains a SILVER SWORD.  Return back outside the 
room and open the chest above which contains an OPAL RING.  Pass through the
hall above, around to the other side, then down to the steps to the next floor.

Climb down two ladders, then head right to a chest which contains a POWER
GOURD.  Go down the ladder below you, then continue right to a chest which 
contains a MIND GOURD.  Return left, then down the last ladder to a chest which
contains a REVIVE.  Finally, walk right to a fork, then up to meet Clack, who 
will tell you where Brant is.  After talking for awhile, attempt to leave, and
he will give you the WAVE RING (ATP+30, DFP+22, INT+15, AGL+5, MGR+15, equip on
Hero).

Leave the cave and warp back to Bakku.  We could warp to Marse, or even sail
around as Clack suggested, but there's a small cave that I passed up earlier.
East of the Tower of Light, cross the northern bridge to the Cave to Marse.
It's simply a hallway with a chest on the right which contains a POWER POTION.
You can either exit to the north and walk to Marse, or just leave and Warp
there with Jerin.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Demon Mace can cast Blizzard, so take them out quickly.
Red Cores are like the Mimickers, except with more HP and experience to gain,
so have Jerin constantly cast Confuse against them to keep them from running
away.  There's a lot of treasure to be found, although most of it isn't
interesting.

Head up, climb down a ladder, then up the next to a chest which contains an EX
POTION.  Go down the ladder to the right to a chest which contains a GREAT
POTION.  Walk left three steps, then down into the swamp to find a hidden MIND
POTION.  Continue up around the plateaus, across the bridge, and climb the left
ladder to two more chests which contain a REVIVE and POWER POTION.

Return down the ladder, then right past the bridge, and up another ladder.
Remember these steps for later.  Continue right past a fork and down a ladder
to a chest which contains a HI BOMB.  Enter the upper right room to find a
chest which contains another piece of ALUMINA.  Go back to the fork, and climb
down a ladder to a chest you can see to the left which contains a POWER POTION.
To the right of the ladder, you will find a chest which contains a GLOOM ARROW.

Climb the nearby ladder, go down a little, then head left to a chest which 
contains a REVIVE.  Walk right and down, then climb the ladder to a chest which
contains a MACH RING (DFP+4, AGL+11, sell).  Go back down the ladder, then walk
around to the lower right corner to a chest which contains a HI MAGIC.
Finally, climb the ladder, and head left to the last chest on this floor which 
contains a MIRACLE.  Go up, left, down the ladder, walk clockwise to another 
ladder you should climb back up to the steps earlier to the next floor.

On this plateau, head left past the fork, picking up two chests which contains 
a FOUL WATER and GLOOM ARROW.  Go straight down across a bridge to a chest 
which contains a MIRACLE.  Return across the bridge and walk right to a chest 
which contains a POWER POTION.  Continue right along the path with four chests
which contains 1000 GOLD, a SPELL POTIION (use on Hero), GLOOM ARROW, and 
ESCAPE.  Take the steps down and out the room to the lower level.

Walk up to the fork and left to a chest which contains a HI BOMB.  Head up from 
the fork to a chest which contains a GREAT POTION.  To the left is a room with 
two chests which contain a HI MAGIC and EX MAGIC.  Leave the room, go left, and
down to the lower left room with a chest which contains an EX POTION.  Go right
and up to a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Enter the nearby room and down the
hall to a chest, but watch out.  Step left two, down three, and right to open
it which contains a HI BOMB.  Then, step up to fall to the last room.

Open the two chests you see which contain a FLOAT and SWEET WATER.  From the 
left side of the left chest, walk up into the swamp to find a hidden EX MAGIC.
Before talking to the man to the left, enter the upper right room to find a
chest which contains a REVIVE.  If you don't get that now, the chest will
become an exit warp point later.  Now, talk to the man in the upper left corner
of the room who is Brant.  Jerin will automatically cast Escape and you will 
receive another piece of ALUMINA.

Brant directs you to the Elba and Ulupp Islands.  Warp back to Marse and rest
up at the inn.  At the church, Brant will also tell you about Herat, but we 
should check out the Fargo Islands first.  Sail north to search Elba Island 
first.

     Nail Man (Fire), Red Core, Red Wolf, Saberspook, Vampire, Werefrog (Ice),
     Zaurus (Ice)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Eye Curse can cast Blast and confuse you, Green Magi can
cast Bolt and Flame, while Red Wolf can cast Inferno.  You should be able to 
keep up with them thanks to the Wind Flute, which Jerin should use generously.

First, head right to warp to Ulupp Island.  Walk around the perimeter of the
floor counter-clockwise to find four chests which contain a HIPOWER RING
(ATP+40, sell), SPEED POTION, EX POTION, and DRAGON EGG.  At the middle of the
bottom of the floor is a switch that you should flip to open a door that you 
cannot reach yet.  Return to the warp point back to Elba Island.

Enter the right room with a chest which contains a MIND POTION.  Leave the room
and climb down the ladder to a chest which contains a SMOKE BALL.  Climb down 
the nearby ladder to another chest which contains the HIDAZE RING (DFP+40,
MGR+10).  Go through the right door and right to a switch you should flip to
open the nearby door.  Cross the bridge to your left and down to a chest which
contains an EX POTION.

Leave the room the way you came.  Enter the room to the left to a chest which
contains a SPELL POTION.  Return to the previous room and take the left door,
down a ladder, around to two chests which contain a MIRACLE and EX POTION. 
Head right and down under a bridge to a chest which contains a HI BOMB.  Walk
around to the now open room on the right with a chest which contains a piece of 
ALUMINA.

Return to the previous room and climb down to a chest which contains a MIND 
POTION.  In the room to the right, you can rest up at the inn, if you like.
Pass right to a chest which contains a SILVER ROD.  To the far right, don't
enter the room yet.  Instead, climb the ladder to a chest which contains a
SPELL POTION.  Continue up the next ladder to a warp point to Ulupp Island.

There are four chests on this upper plateau which contains a SILVER WRIST, 
ALUMINA, SILVER PLATE, and MIRACLE.  Go back to Elba Island and enter the room
at the bottom of the long ladders.  Open the two chests to the right which 
contain an EX POTION and SILVER ARMOR.  Flip the switch to the left to change
the destination of the warp point atop the long ladders, which you should take
back to Ulupp Island.

Cross the bridge, go right a little, and down to a room with a chest which
contains a piece of ALUMINA.  Leave the room and continue right to the final 
chest which contains an EX POTION.  Cast Escape and Warp back to Marse to rest 
up at the inn.

Brant directs you to Herat, so you can either warp or sail there.  If you want
to sail there, hug the coast west and down the river to the castle Herat.

There's a little treasure to pick up here.  Walk around to the right to the inn
and examine the two bookshelves which contain a PLUM CIDER and HI POTION.
Above the inn is a restaurant with two bookshelves which contains a ROD and
APRON.  Behind the equipment shops to the left of the entrance, examine the
area between the two where you can find a hidden MIND POTION and GREAT POTION.
Head up from there to the castle.

Enter the castle and climb the stairs to the second floor.  In the upper left 
room, examine the dresser which contains an EX BOMB.  In the upper right room,
talk to the chef in the kitchen.  He and the people around here tell you that
the king is looking for some really tasty food.  Return to the stairs and climb
them to the third floor.

In the room above, examine the dresser which contains a POWER POTION.  Climb 
the stairs to the roof and enter the throne room above.  Talk to the king, who
will elaborate on what he wants.

Leave Herat and warp to Lyden.  Walk around to the bottom of town, then up to
the restaurant.  Climb down a few sets of stairs in the back to find the Wizard
of Lyden.  He will tell you about the Purple Newt he needs for his recipe,
which can only be found in the cave east of Herat.

Warp back to Herat, sail up past the mountains, then dock on the shore to the 
west.  If you walk south, you can visit the Dragon Shrine, where you can
exchange your 8 Dragon Eggs for a great reward.  However, I would wait until 
later to do that, because the Dragon Eggs will scatter across the world again,
and prevent you from getting some treasure later in the game.  Head southeast, 
cross the bridge, northeast, cross the bridge, then up to the Purple Newt Cave.

Enemies (ocean): Evil Clam (Fire), Jelly Bolt (Fire), Sea Snake (Fire),
     Starfish (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Basilisks can petrify you, while Salamanders can cast Flame
on your party.  The enemies weak to ice have enough HP to warrant equipping the 
Frost Ring, so that Jerin can wipe them out with a single Blizzard spell.

To the right is a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Pass up the ladder and
continue down past a fork to a bridge which you should cross to a chest which
contains a CHAIN MAIL.  From the fork, go right, down the ladder, and the one 
nearby to three chests which contain a SWING WING, EX POTION, and HI BOMB.
Climb the ladder, then walk down around that small area, and all the way left
to a room with two chests which contain a GREAT POTION and MIRACLE.

Leave the room, head all the way to the right, climb down the ladder, and left
to two doors.  Cast Float, and search the swamp for four chests lined along the
bottom which contain a MIRACLE and 3 GRILLED NEWTS.  Enter the left room and
follow the path to a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Exit the room and go left
to a chest which contains a STONE CURE.

Walk all the way to the right side of the area and climb the ladder to a chest
which contains a STUN ARROW.  Climb back down, then walk up the narrow path to
an intersection.  Continue straight up to what looks like a dead end, but you
will instead find a hidden room with a chest which contains an ENGAGE RING.

Back at the intersection, take the right path up to a room with a switch which
you should flip down.  Return to the intersection and climb the ladder to the
left to a chest which contains a GLOOM ARROW.  Enter the room and take the warp
point to the final two chests which contain a POWER GOURD and PURPLE NEWT.

Cast Escape and Warp back to Lyden.  Give the Purple Newt to the Lyden Wizard 
and he will cook the MAGIC FLAVOR for you.  Warp back to Herat and give the
Magic Flavor to the chef in the kitchen on the second floor.  Talk to the king 
at the throne room and he will unlock the treasury.

Head out of the castle, but only just outside the gate.  Walk right to another
entrance which will lead to the steps to the treasury.  Open all 14 chests 
which contain a CARBO SWORD (equip on Hero), SILVER ROBE, TOWER SHIELD, CARBO 
HELM (equip on Aguro), MACH HEELS, MIRACLE, ALUMINA, GLOOM VOICE, EX POTION,
PLUM CIDER, ROYAL STATUE, FRY PAN, POT, and MIRACLE.

With all 7 pieces of Alumina, warp back to Carbis to give Raile the good news.
Enter the lab to find out that he has left to Aisen Tower.  Warp back to Marse 
and rest up at the inn.  I'm not entirely sure what triggers it (maybe getting
all 7 Alumina?), but it appears that new monsters now inhabit the oceans, as 
listed above.  Sail northwest to find Aisen Tower on an island.

AISEN TOWER [ATWR1]
Recommended Level: 38
Treasure: Sour Cider, 750 Gold, Hi Potion, Power Gourd, Speed Potion, Hi Bomb,
     Revive, Ex Potion, Big Arrow, Ex Potion, Swing Wing, Smoke Ball,
     Silver Tarot, PIRATE KEY, Heavy Ring
Enemies: Berserker, Blue Skull, Dark Spook, Fire Plate, Pirate,
     Steel Lord (Thunder), Vampire
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Dark Spooks can cast Perish, while Fire Plates can rarely
drop a Might Armor.  Fire Plates also have fairly high defense, so resort to
your most powerful spells to take down groups of them.

Open the first chest which contains a SOUR CIDER.  Enter the left room to find
a chest which contains 750 GOLD.  Continue to the next room to find a chest 
which contains a HI POTION.  Walk into the upper room to the stairs to the 
second floor.  Go down to the left room with a chest which contains a POWER 
GOURD.  Continue through the next two rooms to the stairs to the next floor.

You will find Raile in the prison cell, but need the key to open it.  Check out 
the two upper right rooms each with a chest which contains a SPEED POTION and
HI BOMB.  Then, head down to a fork, and left to a chest which contains a 
REVIVE.  From the fork, go right to the dead-end to fall down a hidden pitfall 
to a chest which contains an EX POTION.  Walk around to find another pitfall 
back to the first floor and head back to the second floor.

This time, go through the lower right door.  The outer two rooms each hold a
chest which contain a BIG ARROW and EX POTION.  Leave the room, then through
the middle room to the stairs to the third floor.

Head up from the fork to find two chests which contain a SWING WING and SMOKE
BALL.  Return to the fork, and take the left path to the stairs to the fourth 
floor.

Here's the floor that you were warned about.  In the following order, step on
the upper left switch, lower right, lower left, upper right, and finally the
top one to open the door.  Any other combination will alert Pirates to attack 
you.  Temporarily equip Lufia with her Flash Ring, continue up to the stairs
to the fifth floor where you will find who you are looking for.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Bosun, Pirate
HP: 1320, 3492
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: You should take out Bosun first, since he is easier to kill and can
heal the Pirate.  Aguro and the hero should attack every round.  Lufia should 
cast Drain during the first round, then Bolt in each subsequent round.  Jerin
should use Power Gourds on the men, then use the Wind Flute or cast Boost to
heal everyone.  Once Bosun falls, then repeat the same strategy on the Pirate.
*******************************************************************************

For defeating them, you find Lou and get access to two chests which contain a
SILVER TAROT and PIRATE KEY.  Work your way back three floor, and to the stairs
that would take you to the first floor.  While still on the second floor, take 
the lower left path back to Raile.  Before rescuing, open the cell next to him
to find a chest which contains a HEAVY RING (ATP+80, WGT+120, sell).  Now, 
unlock Raile's cell and you'll be warped out of the tower.

Warp back to Carbis, head downstairs, and talk to Raile to have Cooper and he
fix the submarine so you can go underwater via an eddy (whirlpool) that you see 
on the world map.  To get to Doom Island, you can either warp to Soshette or
just sail north and a little east to get there to make a pit stop.

Follow the path to a chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Downstairs, examine the
bookshelves which contain a STRAW DOLL and GLOOM ARROW.

To get to Doom Island, you'll need to take your submarine into an eddy.  I
would recommend sailing west to go underwater there.  Then, go south to one of
the caves under Ring Island.  I would recommend equipping Jerin with the Flame

If Jerin has learned Vulcan by now, she should use that to take out groups of
Maguras.  The others can be easily taken out with Flame.  Despite being called
"Fire" Plates, they're not resistant to fire spells.  Don't be afraid to use 
your MP and use your Ex Magics as needed.  There are currents in these caves
that will force you along a certain path.  Only take them when I tell you to,
or you could end up passing a treasure chest.

Take the lower current to the eddy to the main area of this cave.  You can take
the current up to a four-way intersection if you like, but then follow the path
left to a chest which contains a HI POTION.  From the intersection, go right to
a chest which contains ARROWS.  Continue to the right, avoiding the current, 
and down to a chest which contains a POWER POTION.

Go back to the intersection, walk up a little, then left, avoiding the current, 
to a chest which contains a MYSTERY PIN.  Then, head up to a chest which
contains a POTION.  The eddy to your left can take you to your destination, but
I'd rather collect more treasure.  Hug the wall to your right until you can
walk into a current that will take you to the last two chests which contain an
EX POTION and SPELL POTION. You can then take the current back to the entrance.

Return to Soshette to rest up at the inn.  Take the same eddy as before to go
underwater, but this time, head east to the cave there.  Head along the current
to a chest which contains an EMPTY BOTTLE.  Then, take the eddy to the main
area of this cave.

Avoid all the currents to start.  Go down, slightly left, down, slightly right, 
and down to a chest which contains a MAGIC GUARD.  Continue down along the 
current to the lower area.  Further down, ride the current to the end, but then
walk back around it to a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Ride the nearby
current back near the first chest, and walk into the upper right current to a
chest which contains a MIRACLE.

Head down the lower current to the lower area, then walk northeast to a chest
which contains an OPAL RING.  Avoid the currents, and continue right to an eddy
to a hall connecting to another cave.  Walk right and down, around the current, 
until you can see two chests to your left which contain a MIRACLE and HI
POTION.  Continue down to the eddy to the last cave.

Walk up until you reach the current.  Hug the left wall until you find a chest
which contains a ZIRCON WRIST (equip on Jerin).  Take the current above, but
then walk right and up, around the left side of the upper current to a chest
which contains 800 GOLD.  Ride the current below you to the ride to the end, 
then walk northwest to a chest which contains a HI MAGIC.

There are two chest below you, so walk clockwise around the wall and current to
reach them, which contain a FOUL WATER and GLOOM ARROW.  From below the chests,
walk straight left to the middle current to the eddy to the center of Ring
Island where you will find the ruins of the Fortress of Doom.

I would recommend equipping Jerin with the Frost Ring, since her new Blizzard
spell can waste a lot of the enemies here.  The treasure chests are empty, so
just walk straight up to the stairs to the second floor.  Go up into the hall, 
head right, then down to the stairs to the third floor.  Climb the stairs up to
find the DUAL BLADE and a lot of dialogue.

Afterwards, you will automatically be back at Soshette.  Warp back to Carbis to
discuss what has transpired with Professor Raile.  He will tell you to get some
Power Oil at Epro, north of Marse.  To refit the Falcon, he will meet you at
Frederia: Shaia Lab 4, which is south of Carbis.  Either Warp or sail to Epro.

Rest up at the inn to the left of the entrance.  In the lower right house,
examine the bookshelf which contains an EX BOMB.  Visit the item shop that is 
closed in the upper right corner.  He will direct you to find Hedge to the
north to get Power Oil.  Go down, left past the weapon shop, up the hill, into
the house, and examine the bookshelf which contains an EX MAGIC.  Above the
house to the left, search the flowers to find a hidden POWER POTION.

Leave town and walk northwest to the bridge.  You can find Hedge to the
northeast.  Talk to him to receive the OIL KEY which will unlock the Oil Cave.
However, since the road is blocked, you will need to get there via the eddy to 
the north.  Equip Jerin with the Flame Ring and sail between the mountains
north of Epro to go underwater.

EAST LAGOON [ELGN1]
Recommended Level: 42
Treasure: Big Arrow, Power Potion, Mystery Pin, Miracle, Hi Magic, Ex Bomb,
     Ex Potion, Magic Guard, Power Gourd, Grand Blade
Enemies: Hydra, Manta Ray (Fire), Sea Dragon (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Sea Dragons can cast Flood.  Fortunately, anything weak to
fire can be easily taken out with Vulcan.  Again, don't spare the Ex Magics on 
Jerin whenever you need them.

First, take the upper path to two chests which contain a BIG ARROW and POWER
POTION.  Return to the entrance, proceed left a little, then follow the path up
to a chest which contains a MYSTERY PIN.  In the room above, you will find a
chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Just outside the room, take the current down
to a chest which contains a HI MAGIC.

Ride the current around to the end.  Go down a little, then take that current 
left to a room with two chests which contain an EX BOMB and EX POTION.  Outside
the room, ride the middle current right and continue to the fork from before.

Go up to the four-way intersection and left where you will see a current.  Walk
below it to the left and around the path to a chest which contains a MAGIC 
GUARD.  Step on the current just below it to reach the chest which contains a
POWER GOURD.  Go back right to the intersection and up the path to a chest
which contains a GRAND BLADE (way too late).

The nearby eddy will take you to the other side of the lagoon.  Head left to
another eddy which will bring you back to the overworld.  Sail north to dock,
equip Jerin with her old Frost Ring and Lufia with her Flash Ring.  Walk
around the mountains and through the swamp to reach the Oil Cave.

     Big Arrow, Miracle, Dragon Tooth, Hi Potion, Swing Wing, Ex Bomb,
     Hi Magic, Miracle, Dragon Tooth, Hi Magic, Great Potion, POWER OIL
Enemies: Efreet (Water), Hydra, Mad Knight (Thunder), Mad Wolf,
     Mega Frog (Ice), Rock Golem
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Efreets can cast Blaze on your party, so make sure to have
Lufia cast Flood against them to weaken them enough for the men to finish them
off.  Mad Knights are so weak, even a simple Flash Ring boosted Flash spell can
kill them.  Lufia should probably know the Thunder spell by now, which can also
kill the mighty Rock Golems in one hit.

Cast Float, cross the swamp, and open the door.  Open the chest which contains
850 GOLD, then down to the main area of the first floor.  To the right is a
chest which contains a DRAGON ARROW.  Climb down the ladder, walk right, cast
Float, and cross the swamp to a chest which contains a HI BOMB.  Go straight
down a ladder and left to a chest which contains a DRAGON TOOTH.

Climb down the next ladder, head right to a fork, and climb down that ladder.
Cast Float and search the right side of the swamp to find a hidden HI MAGIC.
Open the nearby chest you see which contains a DRAGON RING (sell).  From the
fork, walk up to a chest which contains a BIG ARROW.  Go up the ladder to
another chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Return to the fork, continue left to 
another ladder down to the steps to the second floor.

Follow the path to a ladder which you should take to the lower level.  In the 
upper left corner is a chest which contains a DRAGON TOOTH.  Start walking
back, but instead go under the bridge to the right and up at the fork to a
chest which contains a HI POTION.  Ignore the stairs to your right and instead
head down and right to a chest which contains a SWING WING.

Go left, back under the bridge you first went, and back up the ladder.  The
path on the upper level is very straight-forward with two chests along the way
which contain an EX BOMB and HI MAGIC.  Proceed along the path to the steps to 
the third floor.

Head right, down the ladder, and along the path to a chest which contains a
MIRACLE.  Return to the stairs, but go right to a fork, and take the upper path 
down a ladder to a chest which contains a DRAGON TOOTH.  Back at the fork,
climb down the right ladder, and walk to the right side of the floor to a chest
which contains a HI MAGIC.  Go up to the ladder which you should climb down to 
a chest which contains a GREAT POTION.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Oil Dragon
HP: 4700
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Despite being the Oil Dragon, the Dragon Ring won't help against it.
As usual, Aguro and the Hero should attack every round.  Jerin should use Power 
Gourds on them, then use the Wind Flute in each subsequent round.  Lufia should
cast Drain during the first round, then Thunder in each subsequent round.  Be 
careful, as the Oil Dragon can cast Mirror to reflect your spells back at you,
in which case, Lufia should join in on the healing until the Mirror wears off.
*******************************************************************************

For defeating the Oil Dragon, you will gain access to the chest which contains
the POWER OIL.  Have Jerin cast Escape and Warp to Frederia.  Either that, or 
warp to Carbis and sail south to Frederia.

The inn is to the left of the entrance.  Below it is a 3x3 flower bed with a
hidden GRILLED NEWT at the center.  In the lower right corner of town is the
same thing with a hidden MIRACLE at the center.  From the entrance, head
straight up across the bridge.  Climb the hill to the right, enter the 
building, and go down the stairs.

Examine the lockers to the left which contain a REVIVE and STONE CURE.  Talk
to Raile with the Power Oil and he will refit the Falcon so you can fly.
First, warp back to Herat and fly southwest to the Dragon Shrine.  You can
exchange the 8 Dragon Eggs for one of a few rewards:

1) Everyone gains 2 levels.
2) You get 3 of each stat-boosting potion.
3) A Might Shield.
4) A Might Bow.

I would recommend going for a Might Shield (equip on Jerin).  After doing so,
the Dragon Eggs will scatter across the world to eight treasure chests.  If you
missed those treasure chests earlier, their original contents will be gone
forever.  One of them is in the Oil Cave, which is why I've waited so long to
do this sidequest.  I'll save re-gathering them for more wishes later.

Warp back to Frederia.  One of the villagers mentions the town of Arubus to the
west, so fly over there now.

The inn is conveniently right at the entrance.  Examine the bookshelf in the

northern side of town where you should make the purchases listed above.

A man outside asks you to get him some Apple Cider to get information about the
Glasdar Key.  Enter the cave to the left.  Climb down the steps to find two
chests which contain a PEAR CIDER and PLUM CIDER.  Continue down to the bottom 
level where you can buy the Apple Cider.  Give it to the man outside and he
will tell you it is in the northern cave.  You can sell Jerin's old Frost Ring
now and equip her with the Flame Ring.  Leave town and fly northwest to get to

Enemies: Barient (Thunder), Efreet (Water), Gorgon, Hydra,
     Mad Knight (Thunder), Rock Golem, Zaurus Rex (Fire)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, you'll probably need a Bolt spell to take out a Barient
with their high HP.  Gorgons can petrify you, but taken out by a Thunder spell.
Zaurus Rex can also be wiped out by a Vulcan spell.

Follow the straight-forward path to a chest which contains a HI POTION.  Cross
the bridge to the right, but pass up the steps (remember these) for now.  Climb
down a ladder and walk left to a chest which contains a HI BOMB.  Head down to 
another chest which contains a GLOOM ARROW.  Continue down the next ladder and 
right to a chest which contains a SMOKE BALL.  From the ladder, go left to a
chest which contains a MAGIC GUARD.

Take the upper left path to a ladder to the plateau.  Head down to a chest
which contains a MYSTERY PIN.  Then, walk left to a chest which contains a 
ZIRCON SWORD (save for later).  Go up and under the bridge to a chest which
contains a GREAT POTION.  Enter the room to the left with a chest which
contains a WHITE RING (ATP+40, DFP+21, AGL+4, equip on Hero).  Pass his old
Wave Ring down to Aguro, then return to the steps from before to the basement
level.

There are two doors above you.  Take the right one down a hall to a warp point
to a chest which contains a MIND POTION.  Walk back to the doors and take the 
left one this time.  Follow the path down two ladders, then left to a chest 
which contains a MIRACLE.  Continue down the next two ladders nearby to another
chest which contains a Miracle.  Go back up two ladders, then down the one to
the right, and down to a chest in the lower left corner which contains yet 
another MIRACLE.

Enter the room above and flip the switch down.  Return to the two doors and
enter the right door to a room with the warp point.  Now, it will take you to a
chest which contains a SPELL POTION.  Finally, go down the steps to a room with
three chests which contain a POWER POTION, the GLASDAR KEY, and GLOOM GUARD
(sell).

Cast Escape, warp back to Arubus, and rest up at the inn.  If you fly 
northwest, you can see the tower, but not land near it.  Instead, land by the
cave to the southwest which can take you there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Dragon has a ton of HP, so throw Thunder and your strongest
single-targeting attacks at it.  Glooms have instant-death spells that hardly 
work.  Mad Clerics cast cast Blast, Sunder, and inflict sleep with Fright.  Red
Skulls are the most annoying, able to confuse you and cast Mirror.

From the entrance, head right, down the ladder, and right to a chest which
contains an EX BOMB.  Go down the next ladder and into the left room below to a
chest which contains the BLACK RING (ATP+10, DFP+7, AGL+10, MGR+40, equip on 
Aguro).  Save the Wave Ring for Jerin later.  Back outside, cast Float, and
search the swamp for a hidden POWER POTION.  Head up to a chest which contains 
an EX ARROWS.  The lower right room contains healing tiles, and the upper room 
has the stairs to the main area of the cave.

Go left, up the ladder, right, and up to a chest which contains a STONE CURE.
From the ladder, climb up the next one to a room.  Enter the next door and into
the right room with a chest which contains a HI MAGIC.  Leave the room and
climb the left ladder up to a room with a chest which contains a SONIC HEELS.

Leave through the lower left door and open the nearby chest which contains a
SMOKE BALL.  In the left room, open the chest which contains a HI POTION.  Exit
the room, climb down the long ladder, down the next left ladder, and proceed
left to a chest which contains an ANTIDOTE.  Climb the right ladder up, go 
right, down the ladder, right, up the long ladder and the next one to the
middle of the cave.

Enter the nearby room with a chest which contains a GREAT POTION.  Leave the
room and open the nearby chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Climb down the ladder 
to another chest which contains a GLOOM ARROW.  From the room, walk all the way
to the leftmost ladder up to a chest which contains a MIND GOURD.  Continue
left, up a ladder, up the right one, and enter a room.

Take either door up to the next room with two chests which contain an EX POTION
and BIG ARROW.  Leave the rooms, go down the ladder, and left to a chest which
contains a DRAGON ARROW.  Climb the left ladder up to a chest which contains an
EX BOMB.  Walk all the way to the right, up the ladder, and all the way to the 
right again to a chest which contains EX ARROWS.  Go back left, up the ladder, 
and enter the room.

Open the chest to the right and left which contain 2 MIRACLES.  Cast Float, and
search the left side of the swamp for a chest which contains a MIRACLE.  Leave
the room, climb down the ladder, down the left ladder, up the left ladder and
into the room.

Use the Glasdar Key on the door to reach the other side of the cave and outside
to the tower.  No more enemies have elemental weaknesses that Jerin cares
about, so equip her with the Wave Ring (you can sell the Flame Ring now) and 
enter Glasdar Tower.

     Waterspout, Whirlwind, Wing Lion
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of the new enemies, Electromaz, Fire Wave, Waterspout, and Whirlwind all have
high damage elemental spells.  Lufia's Thunder spell will be most useful 
against them, as will Jerin's physical attack.

On the first floor, there is a room to the left and right, each with a chest
which contain a HI POTION and EX BOMB.  From the main room, walk up through
the center door to the stairs to the second floor.

Enter the room to the right with a chest which contains a BIG ARROW.  Leave the
room, and walk around it to the door to the hallway.  Head left and go through 
the next door.  Go right to a room with a chest which contains EX ARROWS.  Exit 
the room, and walk counter-clockwise around to the stairs to the third floor.

First, check out the left room with a chest which contains a REVIVE.  Then, 
enter the right room with two chests which contain an MIND GOURD and POWER 
GOURD.  From the stairs, go up to the hallway and left into the other side of 
the floor.  Walk down where you will see a chest which contains a REVIVE.
Continue down to a room with the stairs to the fourth floor.

Head up to the main area with a chest which contains an EX BOMB.  The door
above is a dead-end, so go through the lower right door and left to a chest
which contains a GLOOM ARROW.  Proceed down through the door and along the path 
to two chests which contain a MIRACLE and GLOOM RING.  Go back three rooms, 
through the upper right door, through the next door to the hallway, and right
to the next room.  Proceed down to a chest which contains an ANTIDOTE, then 
down to the stairs to the fifth floor.

Walk through the upper left door to the hallway and into the other door.  Below
are two rooms.  The right one leads to healing tiles, while the other has the
stairs to the sixth floor.

Above are several switches.  The one on the red carpet leads will reset the
three above.  Those three will change the destination of the warp point above.
Step on the right two and take the warp point to a chest which contains a
MIRACLE.  Follow the path up through a couple rooms and a hallway to a treasure
trove with 10 chests which contain 4 MIRACLES, POWER POTION, GREAT POTION, 
SPEED POTION, SPELL POTION, MIND POTION, and REVIVE.

You'll have to go back two rooms, drop down the pit, and work your way back up
to the switch room again.  Reset them with the red carpet switch, step on the 
right of the three switches, and take the warp point to a chest which contains
a STUN ARROW.  Drop down the pit and work your way back up the tower to the
switch room.  Reset the switches, don't step on any of them, and take the warp
point to a chest which contains a MIRACLE.

With all the treasure procured, drop down the pit, and work your way back up to
the switch room one more time.  Reset the switches, step and the middle one,
and use the warp point.  Follow the straight-forward path to the roof, equip
Lufia with her Flash Ring, and step on the lower switch.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Nazeby
HP: 4980
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: This fight should be pretty easy.  As usual, the Hero and Aguro
should attack every round.  Lufia should cast Drain during the first round,
then Thunder in each subsequent round.  Jerin should use Power Gourds on the
Hero and Aguro, then Trick to maintain their attack power.  When necessary, use 
the Wind Flute or cast Boost to keep your HP up against his multi-targeting
spells, but he should go down quickly.

After some dialogue, equip the Hero with the Zircon Sword you found earlier.
You could head for the final battle, but this would instead be a good time to
do the Dragon Egg sidequest.

       Zircon Helm, Sword Shoes, White Ring
Aguro: Zircon Axe, Zircon Armor, Zircon Plate,
       Zircon Helm, Sword Shoes, Black Ring

DRAGON SHRINE [DRGN1]
Recommended Level: 48
Treasure: Dragon Egg x16
Enemies: Various
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
If you've already used the Dragon Eggs once, then this is the time to track
them down again to get more wishes.  Here is where they scatter first:

1) Alekia Castle.  Go up two flights of stairs to the roof.  Then, walk around 
to the upper right corner and down two flights of stairs to find the chest.

2) Northwest Tower.  Walk clockwise around the perimeter and take the stairs.
Enter the right door, the next right door, and up the stairs.  Go left to the 
stairs to the roof where you will find the chest at the top.

3) Belgen.  Walk northeast into the cave to find the chest.

4) Southwest Cave.  Take the steps down, left, and down to the steps to the
chest.

5) Cave To Marse.  This is the small cave northeast of the Tower of Light with
a single chest.

6) Elba Island Cave.  Warp back to Marse and the cave is due north.  Climb down
all the ladders and the chest is on the left of the lower level.

7) Under Ring Island.  Warp back to Soshette, and enter the southwest cave.
Ride the current to the main area.  Go up, past the first intersection, up to
the next.  Then, head northeast, and ride the current to the chest.

8) Oil Cave.  Follow the path to the large room.  Climb down all the ladders to
the steps in the lower left corner.  Stay on the upper plateau and proceed
across the bridge to the chest.

Return to the Dragon Shrine and exchange the 8 Dragon Eggs for another Might
Shield (equip on Hero).  They will scatter one last time to 8 more chests:

1) Sheran Castle.  Climb the stairs to the roof, enter the throne room, and the
chest is on the right.

2) East Cave.  The first chest you see.  Can't miss it.

3) Lyden.  Walk counter-clockwise around the hill to walk up to the kitchen.
Head down the steps to find the chest.

4) Old Cave 7th Level.  Climb the ladder to the door to the main area.  Walk
around to the stairs in the upper right corner.  Climb down the ladder to the
chest below.

5) Purple Newt Cave.  Go right, down the ladder, right, down the ladder, right
and down where you should see the chest.

6) North Glasdar Cave.  Follow the path to the steps to the basement.  Enter
the left door and climb down three ladders to the switch room.  Flip the
switch up and walk back to the room with two doors.  Take the right door around
the path to the warp point to the chest.

7) Cave to Glasdar Tower.  Climb down two ladders, right past the swamp, and up
to the stairs to the main area.  Go left, past the first two ladder, then up 
two ladders to the chest.

You will need to walk to Glasdar Tower to get the last chest.  Walk all the way
down, right a little, up three ladders, left, down a ladder, left, and up to
the path to the tower.

8) Glasdar Tower.  Make your way up to the switch room.  Step on the right two
switches.  This will lead you back to the treasure trove, where one of the
chests contains the final Dragon Egg.

For your final wish, I'd still recommend going for a third Might Shield (equip
on Aguro).  Granted, the Might Bow is kind of nice, but at this point, she
really shouldn't be attacking very much anyway.  Warp back to Arus and rest up
at the inn.  When you are ready, fly northwest to Doom Island.

Recommended Equipment
 Hero: Zircon Sword, Zircon Armor, Might Shield,
       Zircon Helm, Sword Shoes, White Ring
Aguro: Zircon Axe, Zircon Armor, Might Shield,
       Zircon Helm, Sword Shoes, Black Ring
Lufia: Catwhip, Clear Silk, Silver Wrist, Carbo Cap, Tan Shoes, Flash Ring
Jerin: Artea's Bow, Zircon Robe, Might Shield,
       Might Helmet, Cat Heels, Wave Ring
Extra: Elven Bow

DOOM ISLAND [DOOM2]
Recommended Level: 48
Treasure: Power Potion, Speed Potion, Mind Potion, Great Potion, Spell Potion,
     Power Potion, Spell Potion, Miracle x2, Miracle x3
Enemies: Act Demon, Act Dragon, Act Hydra, Electromaz, Fire Wave, Gold Golem,
     Green Core, Mega Atlas, Waterspout, Whirlwind

Land on the lower plateau, go down, then around it to the above shrine.  Just
walk straight up to get through it.  Climb up the hills above to reach the
Fortress of Doom.  There are some new enemies here, but only slightly more
powerful than the ones you met up with earlier.  The layout of the fortress is
exactly the same as during the intro, but I'll repost the directions anyway.

In the left room, you will find a chest which contains a POWER POTION.  Then, 
take the steps down to the next floor.

Follow the path to an intersection, where you should go up to three chests
which contain a SPEED POTION, MIND POTION, and GREAT POTION.  Return to the
intersection and take the other path to the stairs back to the first floor.

Open the chest in the room which contains a SPELL POTION.  Leave the room, then
head up the main hall to the steps to the second floor.

Along the straight-forward path to the next floor are two enclosed rooms.  In 
the first room, you will find a chest which contains a POWER POTION.  In the
second room, you will find a chest which contains a SPELL POTION.  Otherwise,
just follow the path through the hall to the stairs to the third floor.

Before climbing the above platform, you may want to walk around to the back to
find two chests which contain 2 MIRACLES.  Return to the steps, then climb up
to the second platform.  If you care, the first platform will lead you to
steps, where you will find an HP and MP restoration tiles, but you won't need 
them.  Just climb up to the stairs to the fourth floor.

If you like, walk around the perimeter of the room to find the final three
chests which also contain 3 MIRACLES.  From the steps, walk across the glass 
bridge to the fifth floor where you will find the Sinistrals.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Gades
HP: 4200
WEAKNESS: Thunder
STRATEGY: Aguro should attack every round.  The hero should cast Drain during
the first round, then attack in each subsequent round.  Jerin should cast Trick 
on the guys, then heal in each subsequent round.  Don't be afraid to have the 
hero cast Valor, if necessary.  Keep everyone's HP above 300, so you can
survive his Destroy attack.  Jerin's Champion spell is great for healing up 
here.
*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Amon
HP: 4000
WEAKNESS: Fire
STRATEGY: I would not advise on taking advantage of Amon's weakness to fire.
Since he mostly casts spells, have Jerin cast Mirror on everybody.  She should
cast it every round on each character in a cycle, even if they haven't lost
their Mirror yet.  This should guarantee that none of Amon's spells will ever 
get through.  As usual, have the Hero cast Drain, then have Aguro and he attack
every round.  I wouldn't even bother using Power Gourds or Trick.
*******************************************************************************

This is the last break you will have, so use Miracles on everybody.  I would
also recommend equipping Jerin with her old Elven Bow, if you still have it.

*******************************************************************************
BOSS TIME: Daos
HP: 4200
WEAKNESS: None
STRATEGY: Use the same strategy as against Amon.  He always casts spells that
can easily be reflected by Mirror.
*******************************************************************************
FINAL BOSS TIME: Guard Daos
HP: 6500
WEAKNESS: Thunder
STRATEGY: Guard Daos only has two attacks: Flood and Figual.  Figual can
inflict confuse on your entire party.  Thus, it is imperative that you cast and
maintain Mirror on as many party members as possible.  If you have given all
your Speed Potions to Jerin, she should be fast enough to maintain Mirror on
everyone.  If not, then she should at least maintain it on herself and the 
Hero, who can cast Valor.  If too many characters become confused, Jerin can
safely use the Elven Bow to attack your own party and snap them all out of it.
If it's just one character, then use a Shriek to do so.  Otherwise, Aguro and
the Hero should attack every round, while Lufia casts Thunder for massive
damage.
*******************************************************************************

Congratulations on completing Lufia & the Fortress of Doom.  Sit back, and
enjoy the well-deserved ending!

IX. Bestiary

This bestiary is entirely based on the information provided to me by
Thatdutchguy on my forums and is used with permission.  If there is a mistake, 
it's probably due to a typo on my part.  Note that enemy stats are slightly 
randomized upon each individual encounter and may not have the HP listed below.
This list only includes random enemies, as the boss information is listed
during the walkthrough.

Some enemies simply have very high or very low magic resistance, so it may
appear that they are weak or strong vs. a particular element when they are
really not.  If you would like to find the location of a particular monster, 
search for it through the walkthrough, though I'm not 100% certain of every
location.  For items dropped, the drop rate varies, but in general, better
items seem to have a lower drop rate than worse items.
