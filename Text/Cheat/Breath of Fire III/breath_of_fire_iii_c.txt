1: Monster List
 __________________________________________________________
| Monster List                                             |
|                                                          |
| Note that even that if a monster gives you 3000 exp, you |
| get only half or 1/4 from the actual experience you are  |
| supposed to receive because the exp will be divided      |
| amongst your party members. I only include enemies,      |
| because I don't have enough time to state the how much   |
| EXP a boss gives once you kill it. I've divided the lists|
| for easy viewing.                                        |

2: Enemy Skills to learn

The skills here, can be learned by using the Examine command. Usually, you
will learn the move when the enemy you chose to examine does his special 
attack. You can't learn some moves, though. If you haven't learnt the move
in the first try, try again. To know if the skill can be learnt or will be
learnt, look at the characters (you) head. If the enemy skill is learnt, an 
exclamation sign will appear above your characters head. If it can't be 
learnt, a "?" sign will appear and a message will appear and say "You can't
learn this ability...". All skills are in alphabetical order. Some are not 
here, as I haven't learned them. If you know of any skill that I didn't 
write here, write to me at wan_zafran@yahoo.com .

Air Raid: It attacks, and if hit, will cancel the enemy's move.
Aura: This does LOTS of damage, and is very powerful.
Backhand: Not so powerful, it IS non-lethal after all.
Barrier: Raise's your defense against a magic attack
Benediction: Restores all dead party members with more HP than using 
Ammonia.
Berserk: Raises your power for 3 seconds, then you'll die. You're berserk.
Blind: As the name implies, blind the enemies.
Blizzard: Makes lots of ice come out. Not so powerful. All attacked.
Bone Dart: "Bone Darto!". Makes the enemies confused.
Burn: A mini version of Inferno.
Charge: You try to charge and hit the enemy. Usually misses.
Disembowel: This one is cool! It hits the enemy and reduces their HP to 1,
even from 1000HP, it can drop to 1 with a single blow. The drawback, is,
that you're maximum HP will go down to the same to the level before. 
Doesn't work on bosses.
Double Blow: Two blows. Weak.
Evil Eye: This one can be used by Myria. It paralyzes you. Cure with 
Panacea.
Feign Swing: Just to waste turns, maybe?
Flying Kick: As the name implies, needs high agility rate to hit enemy.
Focus: Raise your power, you can do it two times, but if you do more, it'll
be counted as only two.
Frost: Weak version of Blizzard.
Frost Strike: Cool attack, can make you sleep.
Influence: If there are any Berserk characters (Weretiger, etc.), use this
on the enemy to make the Berserk character concentrate on them.
Jump: Does random damage, sometimes weak, sometimes VERY strong.
Kyrie: Don't know what this does, never works.
Last Resort: Your defense will be dropped to 0, and put into your attack
power for high attack power but low defense.
Magic Ball: Magic ball, very weak.
Mind Flay: Lower's the target's defense, whether hit or not.
Monopolize: You can steal all the exp from everybody you are fighting,
but the exp you gain will only be counted for yourself.
Multistrike: Very useful for hitting characters with high agility rate (nut
troops, nut archers, etc.). Only half damage out of the real damage you do.
Use Focus if you have it to strengthen up yourself before using this.
Myollnir: Very powerful magic lightning attack
Purify: Cures poison
Recall: Casts random magic spell, usually Burn but sometimes enhancers for
your team like Might/Speed.
Resist: You become invulnerable for one turn. Pretty useful, but what's the
use of turning invincible for one turn without attacking?
Sacrifice: Sacrifice yourself, the target (all) will be fatally wounded.
Doesn't work sometimes, it's random.
Sanctuary: What IS support magic, anyway?
Shield: A cooler version of Protect. "Hi-Protecto!"
Snap: Chance of making the enemy's defense lower.
Sudden Death: This casts death, but the target is random, so it might be
the enemy, or your team.
Transfer: You can transfer 10 AP to another member in the team.
Tornado: Just like Sacrifice, but EVERYBODY (yes, you and the enemy) can
be hit. Random.
Trump: As the description implies, usable when you're out of AP. Another
version of Recall.
Unmotivate: I don't know what this does. I just got it from Durandal.
Wind Strike: Pretty strong attack early in the game, but weak later.

3. Master List

Of course, after the skills, you wanna know which master can teach which
skill, right? OK, I am not perfect. Which is why if you have anything that
you can submit into here, mail to me at <wan_zafran@yahoo.com> if you have
any info. Note also that if you have learnt a skill from the enemy, the
master WILL NOT teach you the skill. All of the masters here are not in the
order of where you can meet them. I've found some of the masters, and only
the masters that I've found has been put in here.

Chapter 1: a new beginning (The Moffatts?)

After the intro, you'll fight the people. Check your abilities, and use
Whelp Breath. Then check their bodies (both of them), and one of them 
contains Melted Blade, which will be useful later. Then exit the mine, and
go up, and you will be stopped by somebody. Just attack, another cutscene
will occur, and you'll be captured.

In the cage, rotate the D-Pad clockwise to rumble around. Soon, the cage
will fall to the forest. After that, Rei will see you, and bring you back
to his home. When you wake up, you can either save at the diary at the top
of the desk or go meet Rei and Teepo. Don't forget to check the cupboards
for some stuff, too.

Now go to town (McNeil), and Rei and Teepo will be waiting for you there. 
After all that, talk to Teepo, and Rei will get some clothes for you. After
all that, go out of McNeil, and to the Yraall Roads, south of McNeil. 
They'll talk about their work, after all that talking, go to the tree they
are pointing too and watch the cutscene.

Rei and Teepo will realize that if Bunyan's there, nobody will be at his
house. So go back to where you came from (Cedar Woods) and find Bunyan's
house. Once there, have Rei in the lead to open the door. Press L1 to 
change character positions.

In the house, go down to the basement and to the cupboard on the right.
Take the Beef Jerky, and Teepo and Rei will come down. After hearing the
sound, Rei will check it out, then Teepo. After they're both gone, go out
of the basement, and out of the house.

Look's like Bunyan saw them, and you too, and you'll be captured. Rei will
be sent to Mt. Glaus, but you'll have to stay back and do some "work" 
before going after him.

"How to chop the woods"
To chop the woods, press the Triangle button. Wait until the wood falls
down before pressing Triangle. If you press Triangle too fast, you'll hit
Teepo and hurt him (or her?). You must chop at least more than 15 woods
before the time finishes to be set free.

Chapter 2: going after rei

After you have been set free, go to town (McNeil), buy some stuff, or some
weapons, as the next place is going to be tough. Once you're ready, get out
of town, and go north to the "?" sign. Enter, and pass the place. After 
that, it's time to go to Mt. Glaus.

Save before you enter, as there's a boss here. Just go left, going up all 
the time, until you reach a bridge. After you enter the house, rest, and
once you are awakened by Teepo's voice next morning, you'll have to fight
the boss.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st Fight with Nue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

She isn't too hard. Just keep attacking with Rei and Ryu (default name),
while Teepo casts spells. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After she is defeated, either go back to rest in the house or follow her 
into the cave. Follow the trail of blood. If you go left at the first 
corner, you can pick up some items. Follow the trail of blood, and into 
the cave. After the talking scene, check the pile of bones for some zenny 
(that is my reference for Zenny). Exit, and go straight out of the corner 
you came from, to the cave at the right. When Teepo asks if you want to 
dive in, say "Yes". Be sure to heal if you're badly wounded, because you're
going to fight Nue again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd Fight with Nue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same tactic as just now, don't forget to heal when needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once she's dead, check out the thing she was trying to protect behind her,
and you'll find her *dead* cubs. Check out the first cub, the party will
talk it over. Then, exit through where you came from (the water fall where
you entered it from), and it'll lead you straight to the exit.

After drenching themselves, Bunyan will come and talk about "Thanks for
killing the Nue". Rei will say that he feels sorry for the Nue, but then
Bunyan will say that why does Rei still want the Nue alive, knowing she
had cubs to destroy the town? Makes sense.

Chapter 3: breaking into mcneil the 13th's mansion

Spring will come at last, and after waking up, save if you want to, then
go down. After the talking scene, go out to town. The people will surround
you, ask you questions, and then you're safe. Now go talk to Loki, the man
in the green robes who keep following you. Say "Yes".

Now, go stock up on things that you need, weapons, armor and items because
the next place will be even tougher. And buy lot's of healing herbs and
Molotov's as you'll be needing it. After you've finished doing all that,
go down to the farm, and enter the first hut you see. After the cutscene,
go into the first hut you see with Loki inside it, and check the cupboard
for some items.

Now go back out, and find a wall which doesn't match the other walls 
colour. Then press X on it. Rei and Teepo will come, and Rei will lean on 
it. The wall will fall, and you will enter the mansion.

In the mansion, first go left, and use R1 to find the man who is trying to
break in. Talk to him, and he'll give you 50z. Then go through the right
path, and a guard will stop you. Give him the 50z he wants, and then go up
the stairs, and go left. Use R1 to find the wallet, pick it up, and give
it to the man on the right side. 

After that, you'll see some of the "serious" guards. Beware of his 
lamppost: if it touches you, you'll have to start back all over again from 
the outside. Move when he's looking another way, and go down the stairs, 
but beware of the guards at your left and right. Proceed down straight, and
climb the small tower to the bell. Hit it with Ryu's sword by pressing the 
Triangle button. The guard on the left will move away. 

Go through the path where the guard just now left, and go up. A guard will 
stop you, requesting that you get rid of the dog on the other side of the 
fence. Now go down through the way, another cutscene will occur and you'll
have to fight the dog.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pooch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rei's attacks does a lot of damage, so use him to hit the dog. You might 
also want to learn the "Snap" skill from this boss, as it might come in 
handy later. It lowers the enemies defense, so that even if you are weak, 
your attack will be quite strong because of the enemy's low defense. Save 
Teepo's AP for later, there are lot's of bosses in this place. Ryu should 
attack, or heal the others, while Teepo attacks with Rei.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you're done, go back up, and pass through him. Go to the bushes by 
your right side, Mina (BOF2?) will be there with another man. Talk to both
of them, then go up to the guard who's guarding the chicken coop. He will
leave of jealousy. Heal if needed, as there's going to be another tough
boss in the chicken coop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rocky
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocky's attack does lot's of damage, and he has a few good moves. First 
off, he can do the "Ovum" skill (you can't learn this) which will turn you
into eggs. No sweat, after a certain time, you'll regain your strength and
turn back to yourself. Another one is his "Jump" ability, it tries to do
instant death attacks, if it succeeds, instant death. If not, it does 
medium or little damage. You can also Pilfer a Life Shard from him. Fire
-based attack's work well on him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, go up by the stairs to the left, and go right, but beware of guards
with lampposts. When you've reached the right place, there will be a group
of guards guarding. Rei will distract them, and you will automatically 
enter the mansion (of Ghosts?).

Inside, just move a bit in front, and you'll have to fight the boss. If you
have the FireCracker item, don't use it yet, save it later. Looks like the
spirit of the old McNeil's are "living" in the house.

This mansion is big, so you'll have to find the way for yourself. Soon 
after, when you climb a stairs, you'll reach an attic. Rest at the bed, and
save. Then go up through the stairs on the left, and go left, left, left
through the available ladders, and once there's no more, just go down to 
find the grappling hook. Pick it up, and Rei will join you back after the
cutscene.

Go into the house, and you'll fight *gasp* the big boss after the cutscene.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algamam
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy is tough. So use your firecracker early in the game. He has a base
move which does lots of damage, named "Astral Warp". Just attack with Rei
and Ryu, while Teepo does magic. He has very little HP, and will soon die.
He's not as strong as you might think he is, even with four spirits 
fusioned.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4: tricked

After the cutscene, when you wake up tomorrow, save, and go to town. People
will refuse to sell things to you, and you can't save at the inn. Go to the
farm, and talk to Loki. Go to the hut, but Loki won't be there. Bunyan will
come, talk to his cow, but giving clues to you too.

Go back to your house after that. But before entering, unequip all of Teepo
and Rei's armor and weapons as they will be ---- (can't tell or it'll spoil
the game!). Upon reaching your house, the house is on fire. After the 
cutscene, you'll have to fight Balio and Sunder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balio & Sunder
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't win here, there's practically no way of winning. Just let them do
the "Jolt" spell at you, and let them kill you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5: off to wyndia

When you awake, go down, and outside. Bunyan will talk with you, and after
that, go out of Cedar Woods, camp, save, go to West (right) of Yraall Roads
to East Windia. Enter the mountain.

At the mountain, go left, and climb up all the rope ladders you see. If you
encounter an enemy named "Tarman", use the "Frost" spell on him. Eventually,
you'll reach the top of the mountain, and go and talk to Sunder. You'll be
captured, and brought to the king.

At the king's palace, watch the cutscene, and once you are brought to the
cell, wait for the cutscene to finish, and Princess Nina (I'll just call
her Nina from now on) will come and open your cell. Balio and Sunder will
persuade her to open their cell, and once she does, she'll get kidnapped by
them.

When you're given the option to either "Call the guard" or "Break the door",
pick "Break the Door" twice. The guard is sleeping if you call him, and he
can't be awakened at all means. The second time you try to break the door,
you'll automatically use your force to break it. Don't bother trying to 
open the cell on your left with the treasure and Jean the Frog (BOF2) 
inside it.

Go down by the right stairs, and go down, until you meet Balio and Sunder
again. Just die, you can't win. Then, another cutscene will occur, and Nina
will join you. Go up back, rest in your room, and then save in the next
room.

Go to where you fought Balio and Sunder, and go down the stairs. You have
now reached the graveyard. Go to every stone you see, and press ONLY the
green button. Then go to the hill at the right side, or SOUTH-WEST, and
press X on it. You'll be given a choice of colors to pick, choose Red. 
Then pick these words in order:

"Climbing"
"I"
"Is"
"Look"
"Beneath"
"This"

If done correctly, a floor will open and you will fall down to the Royal
Cemetery. Go south, fighting any monsters you see along the way. Soon when
you find a guard, there's an exit nearby.

Chapter 6: hide-and-seek

Now that you're out of the cemetery (creepy place, ain't it?), go to the 
fountain below, and talk to the kid there. Play the game with them, and
here's the location of them:

Kid 1: Behind a tree
Kid 2: Behind a house/shop
Kid 3: Behind a tree
Kid 4: Behind a house/shop

If you can't find them, use the R1 button to change the view and find them.
Once you've found them all, a cutscene will occur, and when you regain
control of yourself, exit Wyndia, and go to the lone windmill near Windia.

After entering, go into the house, and you'll hear a scream. Go back 
outside. Balio and Sunder has captured Nina, and you can't do a thing about
it. You'll then be brought to Genmel. Inside the bar/pub, Balio and Sunder
will talk to Fahl about keeping you. After Ryu munches his way out of the
rope (man, he must have some really strong teeth), and get's out of the 
place, go to the inn at the right side of this place, and save.

Then leave the place, by going through the mountain to the right.

Just go up the mountain, until you reach the hut with people working 
outside, and go in the house. Talk to the man, and he'll offer to let you
rest. You'll then sleep.

When you wake up tomorrow, the door is locked. Watch the cutscene, then 
exit through the door to the right. Go to the machine, watch the cutscene
and stand back. You'll soon reach the other side of the mountain.

After that, go down, but ignore the gate to your right. Go up, just up.
Soon, you'll reach the top of the mountain, and another cutscene will occur.
As you change into a dragon to defend Nina, you gain a dragon gene, the 
"Defender" gene.

Chapter 7: momo the machine specialist

Exit this side of the mountain, and then camp, rest and save. Go down to 
place where there's a "?" sign, and pick up the "Reverse" dragon gene.
Then exit the place, and move your way up, until you reach a tower.

Nina will talk, and when you regain control of yourself, go buy some stuff
from the merchant and then go inside the tower. Just go up the stairs, and 
go up until you hear an explosion. Then go into the room where you saw
the explosion.

Looks like there was an accident. After the cutscene (a big girl like her
saying "Forgive me" to a small girl like Nina? Oh man...), Momo will join
you.

Go up, and to the next room. Read the scroll on the left, it says that to
open the door you must change the colors of all the orange tiles to grey.
Solve the puzzle, like this:

"How to change the colors of the tiles from orange to grey"

First off, start from the upper right side, moving left. If there's an
orange spot down, move towards it, filling up the orange tile. If you 
accidentally stepped where you didn't want to, quickly backtrace your 
steps. Not too hard, really.

After that, enter the opened room, get the Flame Chrysm, Ice Chrysm and 
Skill Ink. Exit the room, and go up through the right stairs. Go up, and
you'll eventually reach a room where there are 4 switches. Here's an 
illustration of which button to press:
                               _
                              |X|
            _     _                         _     _
           |1|   |2|                       |3|   |4|

Press switch no. 2 and no. 4, and you can pass through without a trap door
opening. Go up, and you'll reach a place with switches to move the 
platforms. Easy. Just switch the switches on to move to your side. Then go
to the other side, and go up the stairs. Now, there's a room which will 
need chrysm energy, so have Nina in the lead, and use her special (Triangle)
on the chrysm gem. Shoot eight times, and then ride on the platform. It'll
bring you to another place. Then go up the stairs.

When you reach the library, this place has lasers. Shoot the chrysm gem
with Nina's wand, and move forward, and try to keep all the people as near
as possible to you. Then shoot the gem again, this will form another laser.
Go forward, and shoot it again. Then go up the stairs after you've finished
this part.

When you reach Momo's father's office, go behind the desk and press the 
switch. A rocket will come out, and you and the others will ride on it.
Watch the cutscene, and after the landing, Momo will read the manual, 
revealing that only one person can ride at a time.

Chapter 8: eradicate the mutants!!!

Now, find the "Thorn" dragon gene on the right side, and then exit. Camp,
rest and save. Now go left, to the Coffee Shop. There are no random battles
here, so just go up. The party will stop for some refreshments, and a man
will recognize Momo.

After the cutscene, go to the Plant left of the coffee shop as instructed,
and go find him by riding the conveyer belts. Have Momo in the lead when
you talk to him. After all that talking, go out of the plant, and then save
before entering the cave east of the plant.

After entering, go down, left, and to the other exit. At the other exit, go
left, down, and when you spot a conveyor belt next to magma, you're near
the boss. The boss is in the cave near the magma. Heal before entering, and
prepare to fight after some talking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Woo hoo hoo, now this guy is tough. First off, use Nina to do magic, while 
Momo attacks and Ryu does his "Accession" spell. Use the Flame + Defender
combination, and attack. At first, it may seem that the boss is pretty
much really strong, as he regenerate up to 250HP every time you attack, but
he will lose it after a certain point of damage that you create. When he
loses that, beat him up with Ryu's dragon attack spell. I think the most
effective attack here is Ryu's normal (dragon) attack. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the mutant lost, he'll say his regrets and stuff, and then he 
requests you to kill him. One funny thing to do here is to pull the blue
lever belt, and he'll go backward. If you're ready, pull the red lever,
and he'll fall into the magma. He'll then give you his "child", Pecoros.

Chapter 9: fighting in the battle arena

Now get out of here, and go back to the plant. Talk to the man, and then
go to the side shop by the right, talk to the woman and sleep. Next day,
the man says that to go back to Wyndia, you'll have to snoop in the thing
that pulls the hay.

As you are riding, Sunder will block the way, and you all will be captured
by him. At the next scene, all of you will be in their office, and after
some talking, you'll have to choose a hostage. Pick Peco, he's of no use.

Exit the place, and go to the inn and save. Then buy some weapons, armor
and items that you need. Then go back to the arena, enter the entrance
behind the bunny gal, and find your room behind the Hall Of Fire. Check the
cupboard for a coin, and then talk to the bunny gal to compete. Here's the
rules:

"Rules in the Hall of Fire"

This is a one-on-one battle. You fight with each other on platforms held up
by people named "Dodai". They hold up the platform above the lava, and if
they die, you fall down and it's instant death. Bear in mind that if you
attack the opponent's Dodai, he will attack your Dodai back too. If you 
die, the next person will replace you in the battle. Your opponent will 
fight with his remaining HP.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Opponent 1) Claw
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

She has the Double Blow attack, and the "Blind" move too. Save your 
Accession spell for later, as she can be defeated easily if you use 
"Protect" on yourself at the beginning of the battle. Just attack as usual,
and when she dies, you'll have to fight the next opponent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Opponent 2) Whatzisname? (Please mail to me about his name. I forgot...)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the first round, he'll cast "Protect" on himself. Use the "Accession"
spell, and choose Flame + Defender (+ Thorn if you want to). Attack as 
usual with your normal attack in the dragon form. At his second turn, he'll
cast "Speed" on himself to rise up his agility so that he can beat you up
first. When you turn back into your human form, just use the "Accession" 
spell if you have 5 MP left, and pick "Flame". This guy is tough, but the
next is even tougher.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Opponent 3) Whatzisname? (Please mail to me about his name. I forgot...)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy can do the Lucky Strike move which means that sometimes he can do
really critical attack moves on you which can mean instant death. Use 
"Protect" on yourself, and keep attacking him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you won using only Ryu, I really have to congratulate you. You're one
heck of a serious gamer if you won this 3 fighters using only him! Save at 
the nearby inn, and go right pass the Hall of Kings to the Null Magic Hall.

Enter your room, and search the cupboard for another Coin. Then talk to the
bunny gal for the rules:

"Rules in the Null Magic Hall"

In this place, you fight 3-on-3 without using magic. Magic cannot be used
in this hall because everybody is silenced. You can only attack or do 
skills in this place.

Before fighting, Emitai will come, asking if you could please lose on 
purpose as his daughter is sick and needs immediate treatment but doesn't
have enough money, but Nina refuses as your friend too is held hostage. 
Emitai walks back to his room, then casts a spell on his two Golem friends 
to make them big.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emitai
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, Emitai does NOTHING in the whole fight. His goons are the
only thing doing anything to you in the battle. One is their normal attack
and the other is the "Spirit Blast" which can take off a clean 30 HP. 
Concentrate only on Emitai, because if he dies, the other goons of his 
become confused and attacks each other. Kill one goon, then kill the other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you've won this battle, go to the place where you can rest and save, 
and progress to the Hall Of Kings. Enter your room, and talk to the bunny 
gal. There are no rules here, it's a one-on-one battle between Ryu and Garr.

Garr can do the "Lucky Strike" attack. Either win or lose, the fate is 
still the same. I lost. After he wins, he'll ask for Ryu and his party 
members. After all the cutscene, once you are out of B&S's (Balio and 
Sunder's) office, go down the stairs, outside, and exit Genmel.

Then go left, and up the bridge, and camp, and save before going to Maekyss
Bridge. After saving, enter the Maekyss bridge and try to cross over to the
other side. A cutscene will occur, and then you have to fight 3 of B&S's
minions.

After defeating them, a cutscene will occur, and Garr will come and join 
you. Now choose your third party member, and then choose the arrangement
of the character in battle and choose your battle formation for defense
power or attack strength.

Then you have to fight Balio and Sunder, in their fusion form, as.......
Stallion Metamorphosis!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stallion 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy has some frustrating and powerful attacks, and he does it all the
way Ultraman does. One is the "Jolt" spell, the "UtmostAttack" which you
should fear a lot. This guy is REALLY tough after all the bosses you've
fought before. I recommend having Nina as the third party member, as she
can do magic which always hit, and her agility rate is high making her 
the healer of the team. Ryu must turn into the dragon at the beginning of
the fight. This boss can also do the "Resist" spell, which can resist ANY
type of magic attack you do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you kill him, go to the house under the bridge by going left, down 
the slope, and right to pick up the "Frost" dragon gene. There is nothing
in the house, except some french artists. Exit the bridge through the right
exit, and go up to Wyndia. 

Go to the castle, having Nina in the lead and talk to the guard guarding 
the main entrance. After some talking, eating, Nina will be sent to bed.
When you regain control of her, go downstairs, and go left, and talk to the

maid beside the broken plates. After some talking, something will move out
from under the table. Now go right, and down the stairs. Then go down 
through the left stairs. Go to Honey, and press X.
      ______________________________
     | |____________________________|
     | |                          | |

     | |        dog | |  | | mouse
     | |            | |  | |          

After this, go up to your room, and go out to the balcony. After the 
cutscene, Nina will automatically go to the camp where the party is 
staying. Nina will then join back the group after some talking. Running
away from home again, eh?

Chapter 10: training beyd

When you're back on the world map, go to the bridge on the right and enter
it. After the cutscene, you'll be back on the world map. First off, go
right to the port town but don't enter yet! Instead, go up to the hut with
the "?" sign. Enter, and go behind the hut to the beach to find the 
"Thunder" dragon gene.

Then go back to the port town, and save at the inn. Go downstairs to the
bar, and talk to the man in the red shirt at the end of the bar, near the
other stairs. He'll then talk about meeting his daughter. Now exit the inn,
and go up the bridge north-east. Go up, and meet the woman in tops and
tight-jeans.

Her name is Shadis, and she doesn't seem too fond of Zig the sailor (Macho 
Man). After the cutscene, Shadis will go away. Talk to Beyd, and ask him
about anything that you want. Then go back to the exit, but talk to Shadis
first. Then exit the port town.

A cutscene will occur, and Nina will talk about helping Beyd tell Shadis
that he "loves" her. Go meet Beyd, and talk to him. At first, he refuses to
be trained. Then talk to him again, and then he'll agree to be trained by
you. He'll give you 1000z to buy him a weapon and armor. If it's not
enough, go talk to him, and pick to train him, and when he asks to be
equipped, just press Triangle and he'll give you another 1000z. 

Buy the second sword next to the Moon Sword, as after you help him defeat
Zig, the sword and armor you give him will become better depending on what
you gave him. When you're ready, pick to train him, equip him, and get 
ready to become a master.

"How to train Beyd"

Training him is fun! At first, he's very weak. Here's an explanation:

If you attack while he's defending (aka "Beyd defends..."), his defense
will go up. If you attack while he's waiting for his turn, the damage you
do will make his HP go up. The higher the damage his attack does on you,
the higher his attack points rise. Get it?

Change Ryu to a dragon (Flame + Defender + Thorn) and use him to attack, 
use Momo to cast "Protect" on him at least three times, while Nina defends
or heals him with Healing Herbs. If you run out of Healing Herbs, use the
"Heal" spell on him. If you want his attack power to increase REALLY fast,
use Nina's "Weaken" spell on all of your party members.

Check out how much HP he (Beyd) has by using "Identify" in Momo's ability 
section. He should have AT LEAST 150HP before tackling Zig. His attack also 
should do more than 40 damage before fighting Zig. I think Zig's HP is 300 
something.

"Fighting with Zig"

When you're ready, go find Beyd at the Wharf and pick to go to the
Lighthouse. Iggy will hear it, and Zig will challenge you at night. When
Ryu says to "help in secret", that means that you can help Beyd only when
Zig's looking the other way, or in other words, when he's waving his hand
towards Shadis. 

This only happens when he does a critical attack (aka Lucky Strike), so use
it then. Pick a person with high agility rate (Momo, Nina) to do the job. 
Ginseng works well here too, as it can cause Beyd to do up to 60/70HP
damage.

When you win, Zig will collapse. When you are back at the world map, camp, 
save, and go back and meet Beyd. Talk to him, and after that, open the two 
chests. Each contains the equipment you gave him, only this time, he gives 
it back with a better item. Example is if you gave him the Scramasax, he'll
give you the Moon Sword. Get it?

Chapter 11: lighthouse of doom... (just kidding!)

Once you're ready, stock up on some items, armor, weapons or anything, and
then go to the Wharf. Find a bridge to the lighthouse, and talk to the 
guard. He'll then let you enter. Proceed through.

Now make your way up the stairs, and move on until you reach the door. 
Enter. Read the signpost about the instructions, and then go down the 
stairs, to the other right stairs. You need to go the Main Valve room, and
operate it. If you see an exit, go out. One of them has three Flame 
Chyrsm's, which you will need to power up the valve.

Enter the room (Main Valve), and put the Flame Chrysm into the boiler (the
big thing with a hole). Then go to the left side of the lever, and read
the instructions. When you're ready, pull the lever.

"How to pull the lever"

To pull the lever, you must wait until the temperature stabilizes. In other
words, wait until the line thing hits the yellow cross sign and flashes.
The trick here is, look carefully at the moving line, and just before it
hits the line, press the X button to pull the lever. That should do it.

If it worked, Ryu won't say "Whoops!" and there'll be some orange lights
down the pipe. Exit through the left door, and press X on the lever to 
power up the light. The objective here is to move the source of the energy
to the lighthouse bulb upstairs so that the bulb will light.

Go right, and find a lever. Push it, and you will see another light come
out. There are three levers here, find them all, and push them. Push them
accordingly to bring the power upstairs, and once it reaches up, go 
upstairs.

When you try to go upstairs, a lizard-like creature will be blocking your
way. Just move in front, ignoring it and you will have to fight an eye.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gazer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one is easy. Just turn Ryu into a dragon and finish him off. Lightning
works good on him too. Momo's cannon or Garr's scythe can finish him off
quickly without much trouble. He has two attacks, a jump attack on you and
and an "Eye Beam".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 12: I'm off to faerie land

Now go upstairs, and push the lever. The lighthouse bulb will on (yay!), 
but a faerie will come by and start to destroy the machine. After some 
talking, she'll give you a Faerie Tiara, and when you regain control of
yourself, pick up the "Eldritch" dragon gene on the left.

Exit the lighthouse, go back on the world map, camp and save. Here's a 
question: Have you ever tried entering the field of flowers where each time 
you try to enter, it'll say "You see a pleasant smelling-field of flowers".
Yes? Well, now you CAN enter it.

Enter the flower ring using the Faerie Tiara (don't worry, it'll ask if you
want to use the Faerie Tiara. Say "Yes". You can use it an infinite number
of times) and go up the hill into the hut. The fairy will talk about a 
monster bothering them, so go to the beach as intructed and go to the end.

A cutscene will occur, the dolphin will talk Australian (g'day, mate!),
and suddenly, the dolphin becomes a crab-like creature with horns. And...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dolphin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

He has about 1000HP roughly. Momo's "Quake" spell doesn't work at all on
him, while anything electrically based (i.e, lightning) is the best (water
+ electricity equals = shock!) does lotsa damage. Nina's Lightning is very
strong, and the best combination for Ryu's dragon attack spell is "Thunder
+ Eldritch". Use Myollnir on the dolphin. It takes 10 AP per casting, but 
it does over 300HP damage! The only bad thing is that you gain only 450EXP
and 200z only for this hard task.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go back to the hut, and a cutscene will occur, showing a faerie being born
from a cocoon. Then, you'll rest. Get out of here, and go back to Rhapala.
Go to the bar under the inn, and talk to Guildmaster Sinkar (the man in the
red vest). He'll give you a letter of permission to go to the road which
was blocked by the lava. You'll have to go THROUGH the volcano to get to 
the other side.

Now go to the mountain, up the stairs, and to the right. Go up the right 
stairs, follow the route until you meet a cave. Then go inside. If you meet
any enemies, use anything ice-based. Just go up right, and proceed right 
until you meet an opening. Go down, and follow the route to another place. 
This time, the place is pretty straightforward. Pick up the "Miracle" 
dragon gene on the way.

Just pick up the things you see, and if you see a straight road leading up
to an opening, you're near the boss. Heal before proceeding, and an old man
will come and challenge you. He'll call his pets, and fight you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Old man and his two dragon pets (can't remember his name! E-mail me!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

His pets should be the first to be dealt with; use Nina's Ice Blast. 
Continue using it, as it does the most damage out of all the normal attacks.
Ryu should turn into a dragon, basically the Trygon (Thunder + Eldritch +
Frost). Use the Blizzard, or the Myollnir.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go through the opening, and you've reached the other side. As you can see, 
there are two buildings. The left building is the Tapa Village. The right
one is Angel Tower. Wait! Go to Tapa village first as you need to have the
elder's permission before you can enter. Go right at the entrance, and into
the temple.

Talk with the priest if you need to, because he's a Master. But you must
have learned the Backhand skill from Durandal first. Finished? Go up the
stairs behind him, and proceed up until you see a big rock blocking the way
to the "meditating" elder.

Change to Garr, and push the rock from left to right. Some talking scenes,
and when you regain control of yourself, exit this place, stock up on some
items, and you're off to another place.

Chapter 13: the secret of the brood

Go to the Angel Tower, and enter. Go up the stairs, and when you see an 
open space to the right. Go through it. You can jump down to take the 
treasure, but then you'll have to climb the main stairs again. Go right,
until you reach the right stairs.

Climb up it, until you reach the entrance, and enter. This place is pretty
straightforward, and just proceed through until you reach a place with
three rocks from different sides. Now things get a little puzzly.

"How to solve the rock puzzles/make steps"

Go right from the first stairs, until you reach another stairs. Have Garr 
in the lead, and push the rock down but not too much or it'll bust. Then go
right, and down to the left rock. Push it left, but don't bring it too near
to the middle rock. Go past both of them, and push the rock that you pushed
down just now to the right side.

Go back to the two rocks, and push them both to make bridges connecting 
from the steps. After that, go back to the steps where you made the bridges
from, and cross it to the right stairs. If you ever do a wrong move, exit
this place and re-enter it again.

Inside the place, Nina/Momo will be asked to wait upstairs. Go through, and
find a stone tablet with Garr's name on it. A talking scene will occur, and
you will have to fight "Guardian" Garr.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardian Garr
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Eldritch + Thunder, and use Myollnir on him. If you're out of AP, 
attack him as normal. He should be damaged by the Myollnir attack quite
a lot and will be easily defeated by normal means after that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this, a cutscene will occur, then you'll see your "whelp" self trying
to flame at Garr. Garr will hit you, and then some talking scenes, and then
you'll regain control of yourself. Exit the mine, you know the way, right?
Then, when you find the elevator, proceed to B2. A "spirit" will be talking
some stuff, and then, when you arrive to B2, go in front, and to the right
door. Rest and save, and proceed back out to another entrance at the end of
the hall. Enter, pick up the treasure chest and exit.

Then, go down, and you will see a cart with explosives on it. Go to the 
first lever, and switch it to change the rails. Go to the 3rd rail, and 
push it. Then, to the 4th and switch the lever. Go back to where you the
cart with the explosives, and push it. It should arrive in front of the 4th
lever. Once there, go to the 4th lever and switch it on. Then go to the
cart and push it. It should go straight and explode at the rock.

Then, the Dragon Zombie will appear, and after some talking, you will have
to fight it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Zombie
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy is REALLY, REALLY tough. For first, he can do the "Bone Dance" and
confuse you, making yourself uncontrollable. Second, he can do the "Rotten
Breath", poison that can affect both you and Garr. But remember; zombies
are undeads. So change into the "Eldritch" dragon (only, to save AP), and
keep casting "Restore" over and over on him. Each attack should do at least
400HP damage, and if you're out of AP, just attack him normally. Garr does
some great critical attacks, and you yourself in your adult form can do up
to 230 damage at critical times.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you kill him, he'll turn into a dragon gene and become a "Shadow" 
dragon gene. Another woman will also appear and give you the "Fusion" 
dragon gene. After getting them both, go through the entrance to the right.
Here, you can choose either to go straight, or right. Going straight can
get you some items, while going right exits this place.

After going right, proceed through until you reach a room with two doors
on the right side. The first room has an item, while the second one has
the lever to be pulled for the platform to rise. Go to the second room.

"How to make the platform rise"

In the second room, pull the lever once. Then go out back and check if the 
platform has risen to your floor's height. If not, pull the lever again and
it'll go either up or down.

When you're done, cross through and you'll reach another room. Make your 
way through until you reach the opening of the cavern. Exit this place, and
on your way down, a man will ask you to go to the chief for your reward.

Go right, and you will see two houses. The second one has a diary for you
to save, and the first is the chief's office. After meeting the chief, go
down, and exit this mine.

Chapter 14: weretiger

The chief said something about a weretiger at Ogre Roads, so go there. It's
the forest in the southwest corner. Save before entering, you might die
here. The boss isn't too hard.

Once you enter, proceed through the place. This place is pretty straight
forward, and once you reach the end of this place, you'll meet the 
Weretiger.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weretiger
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go kill him with your dragon spell. Any of your choice would do. Just try
using your new spells right now. And don't forget attacking while playing
with your new dragon spells also. Fusion doesn't work with Garr, for your
information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you damage him enough, he'll escape. Proceed through the exit, camp,
save and then go to the mountain. Pass the place here by just going up, and
you know that you're near the foot of the mountain when you start going
down.

When you reach down, go right to Yraall Roads and talk to the man with the
axe. If you went to Syn City (left of Ogre Roads), you'll remember the 
smuggling issue that was talked about there.

Now go up to McNeils, and go to the inn to rest for free. Then save. Go to
your house in Cedar Woods (it's a maze, isn't it?), and you'll see the old
Rei's flashback. Garr will wait for you, so go up (no random battles) and
to the house. You should hear some tiger roar's on the way up, but just
ignore them. After going up, you'll meet Rei, have some talking, and then
he'll go away.

Now go back to Garr, talk to him, and proceed to McNeil's mansion. You'll
see Nina and her guards capturing McNeil who was suspected of smuggling 
rice to Syn City (know the full story by talking to the villagers before
coming here). Some talking scenes, and Nina will join you. After that, 
leave the place, and head to Syn City (west/left of Ogre Roads). On your
way out, Rei's shadow will leave the place.

Once you arrive at Syn City, the whole place is nearly afraid of the 
monster-tiger which came to attack. Check out the prostitute! "Not on the
menu" she says. Hah! What a stupid thing to say! Now, exit Syn City, and
head up to the north Checkpoint. Save before you come, you might die here.

Go left, and Rei will transform back to his old self. After the talking
scene, and Rei being hit by Mikba, you'll have to choose your party member,
then your battle formation. Choose, then get ready to fight.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mikba
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryu's agility should be higher than Nina/Garr, so before doing anything,
cast the spell "Raise Dead", and then use Vitamin on Rei. If you do it
quick enough, Rei will transform into the Weretiger. This form does insane
damage, up to 200+ damage each time it hits. Sometimes even 500/600+ damage!
Ryu is best transformed into the Fusion + Thorn gene, and if it turns into 
the Rei Hybrid, just do Shadow Walk all the time. He has about 1500 HP 
(roughly).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 15: the chrysm syndrome

When you kill him, go into the house on the right, Rei in the lead, and
open the door. Open the treasure chest for a (new!) Deluxe Rod! Get out
of here, and go to Yraall Road back. After the talking scenes, go to the
Plant, west of Wyndia. Then go there, and find Momo at the end of the 
moving conveyer belts.

After Honey tells her we're here, she'll join the group back. Exit the 
plant through the slide on the right side (yippee!), and go to the 
Yggdrassil tree. It's the lone tree in the forest right of the plant.

After finding Peco, go out of here, and to the plant back. Be sure to have
Peco and Momo in your party this time. Go through the conveyer belts, and 
when you reach a place with several rocks, change to Peco. Your objective
here is to break the furnaces so that the chrysm gas can come out.

"How to move the rocks"

Use Peco to move one rock bit by bit to the X spot. Then go back, and run
to it. Peco will hit the rock with his head (no need to press Triangle, 
just run), and it'll fly away, and hit the glass. The glass will break, and
the gas will come out.

Proceed through the next conveyer elevator, and you should see some more 
rocks. Push a rock to the right side, also to the X spot. Run around, and
go behind the rock and hit it. If you did it right, the rock will fly
and break the glass. 

The place will rumble as if there was an earthquake, and then, green chrysm
gas starts coming out of the furnace. Go there. Once there, change to Momo,
and use her special action (Triangle) to blast the chimney like thing. A
secret entrance will open, and you will automatically go in.

Once down, you have two choices: either to go back and change one party
member or to continue with Peco. Never change Momo, she is REALLY needed
in your task here. Don't bother opening the first door north, it's locked 
and you can't open it yet. Done? From the stairs you came from, go south.
Ignore the chest, you can't pick it up yet. You should see a door.

Go through the door, and you should see 4 computers. Change to Momo, and
go to the open computer with the "1" sign on it. Momo will try to guess the
password. When the door marked "1" opens, you have two choices: behind
all these computers is a room. You can sleep, and then it'll ask you if
you wanna save. Go there if you want to. Or not, exit through where you
came from and go to the "1" door which was locked before.

After entering, go down, and enter the other door. In this room, go down 
the stairs, and you should see a computer with the number "2" on it. Ignore
it, and go down the stairs. Momo will talk about radiation exposures, and 
when you gain control of yourself, go up left. Use the R1 button to change
views, and you should see another creature just like Peco. Talk to it, and
Momo will gain the new password.

Go out of here, and to the first computer room. The computer in this room
is used to open the door AFTER the main computer room (5 PC's) computer 
password is entered. Enter the password (Momo in the lead), and go back
to that room. Enter the password again at the computer before door number
"2", and it'll open. 

There are some boxes here, you can't pick them up. But use R1, and view 
from the top. There's a steel box here, pick it up to find a Silver Mail.
Equip it, and exit back through where you came from. At the room with two
doors (from the "1" door), enter the door number "2". Go to the right door,
and pull the lever.

Go out back to where you came from, and go left. Go down the stairs, and 
walk straight through until you find a memo. Then go back a bit, and go 
through the door behind the crane. Follow the path, until you see another
memo containing passwords for the 4 computers. Read it, and find a way to 
go to the end of this path. You'll then find the "Force" dragon gene there.

Exit this place through where you found the memo, and pick up the treasure
chest. It contains the SleepShells weapon for Momo. Ride the conveyer belt,
and go back to the computer room. Enter the password, and door number "3"
will open.

Go back to the room with the two doors, and enter door number "3". Go 
forward, and as you reach the door, some gas will come out of it. Heal if
you need to before going in, and then you'll have to fight a boss.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Huge Slug
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK. He isn't too hard to beat. With Rei in your team, use the Fusion dragon
gene, and turn Rei into a Weretiger. Be careful, Rei might kill Momo. Use 
Momo as a "healing machine" and use ZeroX's Rei Hybrid  "ShadowWalk". Since
you can't control Rei, just hope that he won't kill you. The boss can use
Syphon, Quake (which also reduces HIS life) and another attack I can't 
remember.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you kill him, exit, and go up the stairs to the left. Read the book,
and it'll tell you to align the pressure from highest to lowest to find
the last password. No need to do all those very boring things, here's the
password for the fourth computer:

"Password for the 4th Computer"

Pick Other. At the second screen, pick 1-3-2-5-4.

Now go to the door behind all these PC's. Rest and save if you want to, 
then go the other door next to the room, and exit through there. Go to the
stairs, and climb it. Follow the path to the room, and soon, you'll meet 
Palet. After the cutscene, you'll have to fight the mutated Palet, 
"Shroom".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shroom
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

He's not as strong as you think he is. Again, Rei's Weretiger and Rei's
Hybrid "ShadowWalk" works best here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 16: freeing deis

After killing him, exit this place, and exit the Plant to the world map...
An autocamp scene will occur, and when you regain control of yourself, go
back to Wyndia.

As you go in, Nina will go with Rei and you will have to camp outside 
because the King thinks that you are the kidnapper of Nina. When you regain
control of Nina, go to the castle, Nina in the lead, and talk to the guard.
After he lets you in, a cutscene will occur. Now go down to the basement
of the castle. Honey will follow you, and then she will join you. Then go
up back, and there'll be another cutscene.

Suddenly, the King becomes aware of "Master Rei". When you need to escape,
go down to the basement (automatic), down still, and down from the wine
stock. You'll see Honey trying to break through the door. Nina will 
distract the guard into thinking you're doing something else. Change to
Rei, and open the door.

Once there, Honey will insert the Navigation Code, and you will travel
somewhere else after Nina has spoken the last few words to her mother.
When you arrive at the next place, go up, and you should be up in 
Durandal's home. Exit the place, and go out, back to the checkpoint near
the coffee shop.

Pass the checkpoint after handing in your passport, and go across the 
bridge. Go through the Mt. Zublo, by going through the left stairs that you
see first of all. Pass the place, and go to Angel Tower. Have Garr in your
party and in the lead, and then go up the tower.

After the cutscene of Garr speaking to God, go down, and if you're the 
naughty type, like me, go right, and to the right stairs. Go down the 
stairs you see heading down, ignoring the stairs going up. You should see
a nekid (naked, actually) woman (cool!).

Exit the place, and go to Urkan Tapa and meet the elder, Sudama. Garr in 
the lead, of course. After talking to him, he will tell you of Guardian
Gaist. He lives southwest of here, at the Tidal Caves. Go down from Angel
Tower to the small route. Proceed through until you reach Tidal Caves.

Once inside, buy some items from the manillo guy if you want to, and then
go inside the cave. Find your way through, and when you reach a place with
a ladder to go down, battle your way through or kill some time until the
tide goes down. 

Go down the stairs, and into the cave you see. Then go up the stairs, and
on your way up, pick up the "Gross" dragon gene. Then go out through the
other side, and to the Cliff Village. In here, go through the rocks heading
up until you see an inn. Rest and save if you need to, as you need to 
battle Gaist after this.

The fox guy on his left is an item seller, so buy if you want to. When 
you're ready, exit the inn, and go to the cave at the end of the village.
Garr and Ryu will talk, and then Gaist wants to talk to him alone. Exit 
this cave, save at the inn if you need to, and prepare to Battle Gaist.

Now go back to the cave, and talk to Gaist. He will ask you to stand in the
middle of the torches, so do so. Doing that, Gaist will transform into a
creature, and you'll have to fight it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaist
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, take out the torches on the left and right of Gaist. They can heal
him, even though little by little, they still heal him. Use the newly
acquired dragon gene here, "Force". Use Aura on him, it should do about
500-600HP damage every time you attack. He can do the "Howling", "Corona"
(Firebreath) and "Risky Blow". Kinda like Gambit, but with more chance of
hitting you. If you equipped your Fire Ring, he'll heal you if he does the
Corona move. I guess he has about 2000 HP (roughly).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go back to Angel Tower, and go to the place where you saw the naked
woman. The pyramid like thing will disappear, and she will awake. She calls
Garr, then beats him up. And she calls him again, and beats him up again.
But the coolest feature is, you get to see her butt while she's punching
Garr... That's cool... Nobody even talked about Deis when she was nude in 
her human form.

When you're finished, exit this place, and head back to Mt. Zublo. Enter
Mt. Zublo, and go back to the main entrance. Go into the cave you see, and
use Ryu to check out the blue wall. He and Garr will be teleported to 
another place. Deis will do the "Eye of God" on Ryu, and now go to Junk
Town near Urkan Tapa. Oh yes, and IF you want her to become your master,
you have to choose the second option when she asks if you like her in her
human form or original form.

Chapter 17: we're off to meet god

Here, go down, until you see Beyd and his sailors go through Junk Town to
the Dock. Go through to the Dock, and go down to the ship. After they all
meet you, go back to the world map, and change one of your current party
members to Momo.

Go back to the Dock. Have Momo in the lead, and talk to Beyd. He'll bring
you down, and ask you if you could fix the boat for him. Momo says yes,
checks out the boat and then asks you to find some parts for her. Now, go
out of the boat.

The guildman outside will stop you, and say that you need the Guildmaster's
permission to go through Steel Beach. Go to Junk Town, and find a room with
a red cloth covering it. Talk to the man behind the table, and he will give
you permission to go to Steel Beach.

But before that, go to the hut left of the beach (not in Steel Beach) and
enter. Go into the hut and find the "???" dragon gene.

Now change a member of your party to Garr. Have him in the lead. Go to 
Steel Beach, and talk to the man near the machine at the top right corner.
He'll challenge you to a rope-pulling contest. You can pick the "Failure" 
dragon gene near there too once you've beaten the boss.

"How to pull the rope"

Pull the rope by pressing X rapidly. The meter shown above the screen
represents how many meters are left for you to pull in the treasure.
If your rope gets 2 meter farther from each other, the rope will snap.
Same too if you pull the rope while the man with the flags is showing
the white flag.

When you finally reel it in, the other man will say "It's a heavy one!".
Suddenly, a big fish with scorpion-like foot will come out and attack you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angler
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the "Force" dragon gene and use "Aura". Since it does over 600 damage,
you'll kill this guy in no time. Angler is very weak on attack, and magic
also. Heal with Garr, while Rei turns into a Weretiger while you do Aura
on the thing. If you're out of AP, attack as normal. If you damaged him a
lot with "Aura" before, it's easy to kill him now since he's really 
wounded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go out back, and camp, rest and save. You may change a party member if you
like, and once you're done, go back to Steel Beach. Find some parts here,
by using R1. Most of the parts cannot be seen without changing the view.
Note that there is also a part on the FIRST pile of junk from the entrance.

Once you're done here, go left, and into the freighter. Go straight, and
pick up the part. Go left, and up to the locked door. Pick up the part, and
go straight up. You can't open the door now, but later. Go down the stairs,
and to the lever. Pull it, and adjust it so that it is the same height as
the crate.

Wait! Don't go up yet! Go left, and pull another lever. Make sure it's the
same height. Then go forward, and pull the lever to change the heights. 
Then go back to the first stairs, and climb it. Go through the right crane,
moving and picking all the parts you see on the way.

When you reach the place where you can't go right after going up the ramp,
go back to the 3rd lever, and adjust it so that it fits the crane to the
height of the right side crate. Go back to the ramp where you were stuck
just now, but instead of going up the ramp, go right. Follow it, and pick
up the part.

Now go back down the stairs, as practically every part on the crates has
been picked up. Go down (ground floor) and pick up every part you find.
If you go back and Momo still needs some parts, just use the R1 button to
change views. Find EVERY SINGLE PART. And the treasure behind the crate
is an armor for Nina. Very good one, too.

When you've given all the parts back to Nina, she'll fix the ship, and then
Beyd and his sailors will go to the bridge upstairs and head on to Rhapala.
As you progress, you'll learn about the Black Ship. When you finally arrive
in Rhapala, watch Zig trying to help you, and then go and save at the inn
at town.

Go back to Zig, he's at the bridge in the boat, talk to him, and he'll go
off from dock. He'll ask you to talk to your friends, talk if you want to,
and then go talk to him back. When he says "Ready?", say yes. When you gain
control of the boat, go north to the darker colored water.

A cutscene will occur, showing how strong the current is and uncalm. You'll
have to go back, so on the way home, Zig will tell about the Legendary 
Mariner, the man who went to the Outer Seas, and came back alive to tell 
the tale. Go to Parch, northwest (upper-left), and go to the mayor's house.

Talk to the sitting man who refuses to eat fish, and he'll say he wants his
ashes to be thrown at the Maekyss River. That's a clue. Go to Maekyss 
Gorge. Have Peco in the lead. Go inside the hut, and talk to the woman.
She'll give you info on how to make Shisu (Sushi?).

When you're finished talking with her, exit here, and you may choose in 
which order you want to gain the ingredients for it:

1. To get the Shaly Seeds
   At least: 8

  Go up from the house, to the three with purple fruits, and bash it with
  Peco. 

2. To get the Vinegar. 
   At least: 2

  Bring Garr, and have him in the lead. Go to the Coffee Shop near the 
  Plant, and go to the well. Talk to the man.

  "How to pull water from the well"

  Lower the bucket by pressing Triangle a few times. You know it's reached
  the water when you hear a splash sound. Once it's reached the water, 
  press Left and Right to haul the water into it. When it's enough, press
  the X button to bring it up. You MUST press the X button the SAME amount
  of times you press Triangle.

  Once you've pulled it up, the man will give you 4 Vinegars as thanks.

3. To get the Horseradish
   At least: 4

  Have Ryu in the lead. Go to Ogre Roads, and go to the place where you
  saw the strange looking plants. Cut it with the Triangle button. Exit
  Ogre Roads, come back and repeat again.

4. To get the Mackerel.
   At least: 1 (10 Ounces)

  When you speak to the woman and she tells you where to get the Mackerel,
  a new fishing spot will appear near the bridge. Fish there, and catch a
  Mackerel.

You can pick up a lot of these items, just in case you need them. When 
you're done, go back to the woman, and she'll tell you how to do the Shisu.
Exit this place when you've heard EVERYTHING, and go to back to Parch. Now,
go talk to the man in robes, and you'll volunteer to prepare a dish.

"How to prepare the mayor a Shisu"

First, press Down on the D-Pad. Choose 1 Mackerel, 8 Shaly Seeds, 4 
Horseradish, and 2 Vinegar. When you've done the right thing, Choose Knead
Sushi at the top of the screen, and then pick End.

The mayor will stand up, and eat the Shisu. Once that's done, he'll give
you a Sea Chart as thanks. Now go back out, and to the ocean.

At the ocean, go northwest until you see two rocks. Go in the middle of 
them and a "?" sign should appear. Enter. After the brief explanation,
go straight up, and left. You need to go to the bright dot on the map.
When you've arrived there, Kukuys will ask you in.

After the cutscene, you'll be beside the Black Ship. Go in, and talk to
Zig. After talking to him, you'll be at the world map again.

"How to ram the Black Ship"

Wait until the ship comes into view. Hold the Circle button and the D-Pad
to dash at the ship. Remember, you MUST dash the ship and ram it from 
BEHIND.

Once you've done it right, a cutscene will occur and after that, you will 
gain control of yourself. You'll be asked to choose 3 party members. Momo
is a must here, as she is in a lot of parts in this game. When you're 
ready, go back in your ship, and save at the diary.

After that, proceed into the Black Ship's first door. Go through the door,
and when you see a stairs going down and a door, pick the stairs. 
Downstairs, go right, and you should see two doors. One at the north, and
one at the west (right). Go through the north door, and proceed right until
you see a machine.

When it writes all those junk stuff, just pick P2. Then go onto the 
platform, and it'll move. When you land at another place, go back on 
until you reach a land with a door. Enter. Inside, go up, and look at 
the machine, and take the ID card.

Exit back, and go to the machine again. I'll just call it the CP from now
on. To go back, go on the platform several times, until you reach the place
where the CP is. When you're there, choose program 3, and go down, to the 
room on the right. Switch on both of the Crane Main Switch, and go back to
the first room with the stairs.

Here, go into the room, and go to the crane. Pick operate without guide, if
you want to do it, or operate with guide, if you need help.

"How to use the crane"

To move the crane north-west (up-right), press and hold the X button. If
you release X, the crane will stop. Now hold and press X again to make the
crane go north-east. Stop above a crate, and let go of the X button. The
crane will automatically carry it for you, bringing it near you and 
dropping it so that it forms a bridge. You MUST have the crane stop at the
center of a crate so that it (crane) can pick the crate up.

After the crates have been aligned to make a bridge, go forward, and enter
the door on the other side. Switch the lever, and a bridge will come up 
allowing you to go back to your boat at any time. Rest and save now, and
change any party members if you want to, EXCEPT Momo.

Go back to the stairs, and go up. In this room, go left, and ignore the
south door as it cannot be opened yet. Go right, and go up the stairs you
see at the far end side. Go up, and use the elevator. Once you're up, 
change to Momo and have her "look" at the control panels.

After all the talking scene, she'll ask you if you're ready or not. Ready 
or not, here I come!

"What to do after Momo says "Ready?""

Go down to the room with the door I told you to ignore earlier. Enter the
first door you see from the stairs, and enter it. Look at the machine, and
a counter should appear above it with the Boost Counter name. From now,
count the number of ticks from the number you see on the screen. For 
example, if it shows 30, wait until it reaches 31 and count from there.
Don't stop. Go back up to where Momo is, and wait beside her. Wait until
it reaches 100, and INSTANTLY talk to her.

Some rumblings will occur, and then some more cutscenes. Zig will go back,
and the other party members will join you, and then you (automatically)
waste some time. Suddenly, some alert signal warns you. Go back up to the
control panel to meet Momo.

Now, go back to the room with the door I told you to ignore earlier, and
enter it. Just go right, and go into the room to pick up the Ivory Dice.
Go back out, and go straight down from the arrow, and follow the route. In
the other place, just walk through. The chest contains a Soul Gem, and
go down the stairs you see. 

When you come across a place with crates, just go through to the other 
stairs and climb up. Needless to say, just navigate yourself through this
place. When you reach the top of the ship, go up the ramp and go left.
Heal yourself before nearing the edge of the ship, because there's a boss
here. 

When it asks if you need to walk back, just press right to move back. When
the monsters moves, quickly go back before it hits you. When you reach the
middle of the ship, you'll have to fight the two enemies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two Monsters
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rei should turn into a Weretiger, while Ryu uses the "Force" dragon gene.
Just use Aura, and if you're nearly out of AP, attack as normal in his
"Warrior" form. Rei should do over 500HP damage some times. Whoever your
third party is, if it's Nina, then do IceBlast. If not, cast Might on Rei
and Ryu (if you're using Momo). The machine gun will sometimes fire at the
monsters, and that should help you. Try to keep alive as you get 9000 EXP
for killing them. Lot's, huh?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you kill them, go back in the boat through the stairs. Some dialogues
on the screen, and then you'll arrive in Kombinat. At Kombinat, rest and 
save at the inn in the house at the far right corner if you want to, and 
buy some items or weapons. 

Exit out of here through the northern exit up a stairs, and go forward 
until you reach Steel Grave. If you want to, there's a fairy flower ring
(in the middle of a desert?) at the left side. Enter the fairy ring if you
want to, and once you're done and ready to rumble, enter Steel Grave.

The Steel Grave is pretty straightforward, just follow the path. There's a
fishing rod here, just go through the left path when you see one giving you
a choice in going left or right. Right makes you proceed through, and just
go up, until you reach the exit.

At the exit, enter the "Colony" building. In here, your objective is to 
make Relay Point A usable. Go up the stairs, and into the room you see. In
here, after all the talking scenes, pick up the bag and get the key. Exit
this place, and go left, and pick up the "Failure" dragon gene. The cool
looking door on the right still can't be opened, so don't bother.

Move through the way to the left, and follow the route. Go into the door
you see ON the building, but don't drop down the first place you can jump.
I don't know what's in there, so please e-mail me. When you reach a place
you can jump with glass under it, JUMP. Inside, have Momo in the lead and
have her look at the control panel.

After the talking scenes, arrange the reflectors.

"How to arrange the reflectors"

Remember the principal of light? Light goes through a straight line. Your
mirror uses the same principal too. Light reflects off it, making your face
seen on the mirror. Arrange them, so that they can "bounce" off one another
like this.

       /Fuse\
       \Fuse/

    \          
               /
           \
           || <-- This is the laser. The others are reflectors.

If you did it right, go back to the control panel of this place and switch
it on. When it's done, the teleporter will be activated. Get out of here,
and go to the room with the teleporter. When you arrive at the other place,
follow Honey out.

Chapter 18: village of the brood, dragnier

When you reach the main room of the freighter, Momo will recognize it as
Steel Beach. Now go out back to the world map, and rest and save, buy items
or weapons because the next place is going to be tough. When you're ready,
go back in the door, but don't go to Relay Point A. Go down, and follow the
route down, ignoring the first stairs you see.

Just make your way through, don't worry. When you see a place with four
levers that can only be pulled ONCE for each lever, switch all these levers
in order according to the way you saw them.

West (right)
South (down)
North (up)
East (left)

All the cranes will rise, allowing you to pass through. Now go left, up the
stairs and through the "road of cranes" to the other side. Go up the stairs,
and just progress through until you reach a place with three platforms and
a locked door. Now THIS is a puzzle.

"How to reach the center switch"

The platforms will move in the direction that you ride it from. If you came
heading south from north, it'll head south/down. The illustration is not 
specific enough, so the width of the pit is not too accurate. You can see
it like this:
  _ _ __________ _ 
 | |1|          |2|| I'll use numbers to make it easy. First off, ride no.2
 |                 | to the left until it hits no.1. Then ride no.1 to the
 |        _        | south/down. Go back to no.2 so that it stops beside 
 |       |C|       | no.1. Go to 3, and step at it from the east/left side
 |                 | to make it go no.2 go right. Go back to no.1, and make
 |_                | it go to the top side. Then do the same to no.3. When
 |3|_______________| no.3 is at the top, ride it from the east/left side so
 that no.1 goes right. Now all the numbers are near the walls. Okay.
   _ ___________ _
 ||3|           |1|| Ride on no.2 from the west/right side to make it go 
 |                 | left. Then go to no.3 and make it go down from the
 |        _        | north side. It should collide with no.2. Go to no.1,
 |       |C|       | and make it go left, and down. Now there are three 
 |                 | platforms in a row, right? Good. Ride no.1, but it'll
 |               _ | miss the center, and just pass it. Never mind, it's
 |______________|2|| supposed to do that.
  _________________  
 |                 | Move no.3 north/up. Then, from the east/left side, 
 |                 | make it go right, and then down. Go to the right side
 |        _        | of the pit, and ride it to the center. Yay! Now move
 |       |C|     _ | around the center to activate the switch, and once the
 | _            |1|| switch has been pressed, ride back on the platform, to
 ||3|              | the other side to the opened door and progress through
 ||2|______________| after this mind boggling puzzle.

Once you're on the other side, just make your way through until you reach
outside. Outside, just go through the other door until you find the antenna
high in the sky. Your objective here is tune it to a place with very little
noise.

"How to turn and tune the antenna"

To turn the antenna to another side, use the D-Pad to control the direction
of where the antenna is facing. When you hear a sound with very little or
none noise, quickly press X before the place gets noisier.

If you did it right, the place will rumble (a bit) and the teleporter will
be activated. Go there. Once you're back at the teleporter, go to the 
Container Yard and pick up the "Radiance" dragon gene. Go back to the
teleporter, and go to Dragnier, village of the Brood.

When you're there, a cutscene will occur, and you'll be invited to a feast.
After watching the cutscene, Ryu will be dreaming and will be awaken by an
old woman. Dragon Prince. Cool! Anyway, go back outside, and Rei will jump
down to catch his "prey".

After some talking, go to the place with the teleporter, but instead of 
going in, go left, up the stairs, and talk to Garr. After that, the elder
wants to see you. Exit this place before going there, and have Nina in
your party. Remove Rei for the moment.

Go down to the underground, and follow the stairs, to the other side. In
the next room, you can see a picture being hanged from the left. Breath of
Fire 2. Go through the door on the opposite site, and there are three doors
from the left.

The first has the Elder, the second, nothing, and the third has an Ivory
Dice if you search both cupboards. After picking up the Ivory Dice (if you
want to), go to the first room and meet the Elder. When he wants to speak
to Garr, change to Garr and have him in the lead.

When he asks for a nice "plump" young woman, change to Nina. If you try 
bringing Momo, there's a surprise! I won't tell you what it is, as it'll
spoil the fun. When he asks if you are ready or not, say no, and go outside
and change your party to your most strongest members, including Rei.

Go back to the Elder, and after some talking scenes, you'll have to fight
him in his dragon form. Note that you can't become a dragon here as you are
too strong and will be detected by Myria if you do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elder Dragon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Elder will be easy to defeat if you equip any armor that is protected
by fire or rings (Fire Ring, Magma Armor). His Siroccoo spell which drops 
things like Simoons are actually fire and can drop your maximum HP. Rei 
must turn into a Weretiger, and since there is only one enemy, use 
Influence if you have learned it (BossGoblin). That should make Rei 
concentrate only on the Elder Dragon. Since you are not strong enough 
without your dragon attack spells, you become the healer. If you brought
Momo, let her be the healer and let her cast Might and Speed at you so 
that you can assist Rei in attacking the Elder dragon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you defeat him,  he'll die and give you the "Infinity" dragon gene.
Now this one is AWESOME! If you use the KaiserBreath, it looks like
Nuclear Explosions! And you become like a Super Saiyan with your golden
coloured hair.

After all the talking scenes, exit the underground, and go outside. Buy 
some items. After the old man talks to you, go down, and exit. When the man 
asks if you want to leave, say Yes. You'll end up back on the world map. 
Rest, camp and save. If you want to, you can check out your fairies on the
fairy ring on the right side.

When you're done, head up north to the factory where behind it lies:
The Desert... Of Death! Muahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Sorry, didn't know what came over me. I was feeling... evil. And have Momo
in your party before proceeding.

At the factory, progress through. If you see a path heading up, follow it
to find a chest. There are three chests. And this is an EXCELLENT place to
gain Zenny if you're broke, because if you find a Golden Egg (enemy), try 
to kill it. It has about 600HP, but if you manage to kill it, it'll give 
300EXP and 10,240z for each kill! Cool, huh?

When you progress inside the factory, I can't help you here. It's pretty
straightforward, and I'll help you once you reach the place with the
Worker Bot you need to control.

"How to control the worker bot"

Go down, and face the panels to activate them by pressing Triangle. The
one down is unreacheable yet due to not enough space. You have to make
the Worker Bot "stuck" by the thing that blocks his way, thus making you
have enough space so that you can move back.
   ____________
  |            |
  |    |1| |2| |
  | |3|  _     |
  |  _  |x|    |
  | |_|        |
  |____________|

Your Worker Bot must be stuck at the X place while you move backward to 
regain enough space. Then move forward and go between the 3 and nothing
box. Hit the switch, and then find a door near an electricity charge that
has been discarded. I can't remember which, so please mail me telling where
it is.

Go through the door, and go up the green colored stairs, until you reach
the door. Change to Momo, and *shoot* the control panel beside the door,
and the door will open. Progress through, until a cutscene will occur.
After talking to him (automatically), talk to him again for more info on
the desert.

First thing you've got to do, and most important thing of all, is to get
the water on the right side in the jar. You need the water to drink if you
become thirsty while walking. If you don't drink the water, you'll risk the
chance of losing your HP permanently. Then you can save if you want to at 
the diary, and then go up north and exit this place.

"How to cross the Desert of Death"

There are three stars that you can see, right. The leftmost star (Evening),
the center star (True North) and rightmost star (False North). Follow the
False North star, and just follow it. Do not use your water until a message
box says "Your throat's feeling dry. You should use the water." When it
says that, quickly drink your water. There are some random battle spots
here.

Follow the False North star, and sooner or later, you should see a shape
with lights shining in the distance. Go forward, still following that 
route. When you see one star in the right moving left towards the town,
you're near the end of the desert. Continue forward, and check out the 
stars that are moving left. As it does, the light at the town will 
dissappear bit by bit.

When it totally dissappears, and you can only see the shape of the town
without the light, go left and follow the True North Star. You better camp
and save, or rest if you want to, as there's going to be a boss after this.
Enter the next battle ground, and a cutscene will occur. After the ground
rumbles, you'll have to fight the boss.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manmo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Manmo has about 3000HP, not much. Change Rei into a Weretiger, and if
you learned Influence from BossGoblin early in the game, use it here on
Manmo. Rei will attack ONLY him, thus making it easy to concentrate. After
casting Influence, change Ryu into the "Warrior" (Force dragon gene). Use
Aura repeatedly. Momo (or whoever your third member is) should be the 
healer and spellcaster. If Momo has learned Ragnarok, use it too. It'll 
give you 6000EXP after you kill it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 19: goddess myria (Maria, ohh maria...)

Once it's dead, you'll enter a (auto) camp scene. After talking with 
everybody, exit the camp, and Rei will automatically talk to you. Now go
behind the Rakda, and press (nooooooo!!!!) Triangle on the creature. He'll
fall down and die. When you get the Rakda meat, go back in and give it to
Nina.

After that, you'll all reach Oasis Town. Here, after all the talking 
scenes, exit and go to the Inn but don't go in. Instead, go to the door
right of it, and buy some items if you want to. Then go out back, and go
right up the hill. You'll exit Oasis Town.

You have two choices now: Either you want to have a shortcut to go back
home at any time or to progress with the game. If you want to go back home
for a while (meet your faeries, or anything), have Garr in your party, and
go the "?" building at the right side.

"How to go back"

It's the Container Yard, where you picked up the "Radiance" dragon gene.
Have Garr in the lead, and go into the building, and to the far right side.
Push the crate until it breaks, revealing a stairs to the teleporter. 

If you're ready, come back here, and let's progress with the game. Go up,
and to the town of Caer Xhan.

At the town, go north-west (up-right) into the building next to the broken
bridge. Inside the building, go forward, and down the ramp to the left 
stairs and go down. Pull the lever and it'll turn out the lights. Go up 
back, and you should be able to see the laser beams now.

The laser beam is deadly, as it can block your character, and push them
to inflict damage. Pick up the Moon Tear in the middle, and go up to the
other place with 5 laser things. Move forward, but be careful not to hit
them. Once you reach the end, enter the room, and activate the Portal
Operation to Station Myria. Say yes, then go out through the exit on the 
left.

              N              O             T              E

             Since Myria Station is huge, I'll detail every
                 single thing that you need to do here. 
     
Jump down, at the place where you can jump, and go left into the other
building. Look at the control panel, and the door will open. Follow the 
door, to the end to go to Station Myria. Then board the bridge and the
thing will bring you high up in the sky to Station Myria.

At the station, go right to go to enter by the worker's entrance. The
main entrance is locked. At the worker's room, go forward and up the 
stairs. Pull the lever, and go back down to the elevator. Before you
leave, pick up the items using the R1 button to change views.

Go back down, to the elevator. Go to the arrival platform, and take the
chest with Wisdom Fruit. Then go to the Maintenance Deck, and go to the
opposite side. Go to Worker's area. Go upstairs and release the Main 
Entrance lock and the laser lock for the laboratory.

Go down, and go the other way around. The doors with the "F" signs can't be
opened yet, as you don't have an ID card. As you go left, you'll see a door
which doesn't have anything beside it. Enter, and check out the cupboards.
Then rest and Save at the top of this room. Exit the room, and go to the
stairs at the end of the corridor.

When you go up, check one of the cupboards for 400 Zenny. Go out through 
the other exit, and you can see two colored tile paths. Follow the yellow
path, into the room where you can see the monster. Since the monster is
asleep, you decide to take the ID card that is with it by disabling the
sleeping gas. The control panel is on the left side. Now follow the yellow 
path back outside.

Go to the second room after the first one where you entered this from, and
you should see some electric currents. Go to where you see the sparks, and
it'll ask if you want to enter. Say Yes. Now run through the place as fast
as you can, and once you're on the other side, heal before progressing.
___________________________________________________________________________
Interlude: Items

If you need some items or money, here I will describe where to get them:

To get 10,000z, at the moving escalator place, use R1 to change views
near the object. There's a chest there.
To get the Slicer, before entering the door with the Chimera in it, check
the chest for a Slicer. Weapon for Rei.
To get the HE Shells, weapon for destroying the plants blocking the path,
go to the lift where Chimera was sitting, go through the door, and pick up
the HE Shells. Weapon for Momo.
To get the Holy Robe, at the room after the medication room, check out
the room at the top with the chest for a Holy Robe. Armor for Momo.
To get the Ivory Dice and Skill Ink, enter the underground place (can't
remember where) where there are a few chests. Pick them up.
___________________________________________________________________________

Go down the lift, and heal before entering the glass filled room. After 
some cutscenes, you'll have to fight the boss.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chimera
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change into a Weretiger, Force dragon with Ryu, and Nina be the healer and
spellcaster. Cast Might and Speed on each of them, and have Ryu use Aura.
If out of AP, use Wisdom Seed to restore AP. The boss can use the 
Paralyzer, which can make you can't move unless you restore your status
either with Panacea or get attacked.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 20: reunited with teepo

Once you defeat him, pick up the ID card. Go to the lift under him and pick
up the HE Shells in the other room. Go up back, and go to the room with
the two colored tiles. Follow the green one, until you reach a room with
green plants. Have Momo in the lead, have her equip HE Shells and blast the
plants!

Go into the room that it lead to, and pick up all the treasure chests you
see along the way. When reach the end, have Rei in the lead to open the
door Go through the room and check the cupboards for a Ginseng and a Wisdom
Fruit. Go through the other place and pick up the Silver Tiara, an armor
for Momo. 

Go to the door at the top of the stairs, and use the elevator to go to 
Eden. In this place, find the two treasure chests which contains a Soul Gem
and another one that I can't remember. Once you're done, cross the bridge 
and you'll startle a bird. After some talking with Teepo, you'll appear in 
your friends "hearts". Go to the second blue light, hear Nina, go to the
third blue light. 

You'll see Nina, then walk straight forward until you see the dragon
statue. Look at it, then go back to the 1st blue light. After seeing Rei,
look at the dragon statue at the right side of the blue light, and it will
heal you. Save your game if you want to, because there are two bosses after
this.

Go up and progress until you reach another blue light with a statue. Talk 
to it, and then wait until he talks to you back. Don't move at all. When he
opens another blue light, go there, and you will go to another place.

At this place, your objective is to go out of the maze. Walk through the
place, until you find Garr. Talk to him, and then go to the pink spot to
teleport to another place. At the other place, Peco will greet you. Heal
yourself, and then go up the stairs.

When you go up the stairs, Teepo will talk some stuff, and then he calls
a skeleton warrior riding a hellhound. Fight it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arwan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save your AP here, as there's another battle that you need to fight after
this. Go kill him with your normal attacks. He has roughly 1500HP.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you kill him, you'll fall down back to Eden. Then Teepo comes and
attacks you. You can choose the party member, the battle formation and
then you'll have to fight Teepo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon Lord
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now this is what I call TOUGH! He has roughly 10,000HP. Change Rei into a 
Weretiger, although it won't inflict as much damage here. Ryu MUST turn 
into a Force dragon and use the Aura. Momo should be the healer and 
spellcaster. After you kill him, you'll get the Dragon Sword and Dragon 
Armor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've killed him, he'll turn into his dragon whelp form, and die. Now
go down back to the elevator, and back to the room where you can rest and
save. Then go back to the room with the two colored tiles. Go right, out of
the "square" from the door, and go to the bottom left door. Inspect the 
right of the door, and use the keycard on it.

Chapter 21: the final confrontation

Go inside, and go through the door. If you've finished the game, the door
you have passed through will have a red sign above it. Go through each 
door, and you will have to fight past bosses or never fought bosses. You
have to fight 3 Nue's first, but they're easy with your strength now.

Once you see a stairs going down, go down, and you should see a diary. 
Before saving, go to the door on the right side of the diary and rest to
heal yourself. Don't forget to open the chest and pick up Cupid's Lyre,
an item which heals your HP back to full every time you walk/run. Save,
and go down the stairs. After Honey runs away, follow her, and at the 
corner, Honey will open the gate for you.

Follow the opened path to the elevator, and go down. When you exit, a woman
will appear and talk about Myria. Go to her, and exit the door behind her.
In this place, there are no random battles. Follow the route, until you can
see a floating platform. Heal if needed, and change equipments if you want
to.

Myria then appears, and she talks some stuff about protecting the world.
When she becomes angry, she vanishes each member of your team one by one,
to the place "where they belong", except you and Peco. Peco goes near you,
and calls your friends back. After she kneels down, talk to your friends,
and then talk to her. After this, she'll ask you whether if you want to
give up your power (bad ending, you sit in Eden forever) or choose your 
own path (good ending, you get out of here and are free to roam the whole
world map and do whatever you want to do.

If you choose the second option, she'll transform, and fight you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Myria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

She is really powerful! Her Holocaust attack can do up to 150 HP damage,
and her Venom attack can do a three in 1 combo, Blind, Poison and Confuse.
Rei should be turned into a Weretiger, and cast Influence. Ryu must turn
into the Warrior (Force), and use Aura lots of times. Momo should cast 
Speed, Protect and Might on every member of your party. You should stop
casting Might on Ryu when his attacks reach 1000HP and above. It should
take about, um, let's see, 12 hits to kill Myria. She has about 15,000HP,
and if each of your attack (Aura) does 1300+ damage, plus Rei's Weretiger
attack, that should do a lot of damage PER TURN.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you defeat her, you'll exit by falling down to the main hall, and exit
the plant. You'll end up in the desert, and you walk in front to Nina, and
she joins you, and you walk forward, and meet Momo and Rei. Nice art! After
this, it's the credits scene, and after that a plant will sprout with a 
FIN word by the bottom right. Wait, and it'll ask you if you want to save 
to fight the goddess again. Say Yes, and you're free to roam the World Map.
You start back at Dragnier.

Updates
--------
v1.0 : The only thing available in here is the walkthrough, as it's the
first version of my FAQ. Watch out for some more stuff in the next update.
It was also the first public release of my FAQ at GameFAQs and at my 
homepage.
v1.1 : Added the Monster List. I'll try to put in, umm, the Enemy Skill 
list next. 
v1.2 : Done! That was really tiring writing all those enemy skills, going 
back everywhere to find the enemy's statistics and stuff. Anyway, I have 
to get back to work and finish the Master's list, which I'm doing right 
now.
v1.3 : Man, this is really hard work, writing all of these in one day while
playing the game. Anyway, the Master's list's has been added, but is still
incomplete due to the number of Masters that I haven't found. Please e-mail
me if you know a master that I haven't found (lots, I think).
v1.4 : Yawn. Fixed some spelling errors, and some text I think you'll
find boring. The intro speech has been changed too. Anyway, please mail
any stuff you know to <wan_zafran@yahoo.com>.
