                           1. Version History

=======================================================================

Updated to Version 16.0- Beware the Ides of March! Well... not really.
I just added some more new information, mainly to some of the latter
parts of the walkthrough. Thanks goes out to Unfair, Ragnarock500, and
everone else from the BoF3 board who have been mentioning this stuff to
me (you know who you are). Nothing too major here. (3/15/04)

Updated to Version 15.0- With my little writing hiatus over, my first
update for 2004 is a doozie. I've reformatted several sections and
added enemy and item listings for each sub-chapter in the walkthrough.
The section on dragons has been completely re-vamped, and the spell
list has also undergone some worthwhile changes. Other little bits of
new info have also been added throughout the guide. I'd like to thank
True Kaiser and Mew seeker for the information they've given me, as
well as Kusanagi and MeepleLard for explaining the dragon stat
multiplier system to me so I could carry out my dragon form
experiments. (2/16/04)

Updated to Version 14.0- After a lot of testing, I added an in-depth
section on formations. No other major changes though. (12/20/03)

using the Comcast address now, as my mail account with AOL will be
closing at the end of the year.

Updated to Version 10.0- Wow version 10! Well, I added the new Balio
and Sunder: The Age Old Question section. Made some other small changes
as well.

Updated to Version 9.0- I completely reformatted the entire guide. I've
added lines to all the sub chapters to make things a lot easier to
read, as well as moved the Version History to after the Table of

Added a little bit of information about the Black Ship Crane items.
Thanks Michael, <shodei@yahoo.com> for reminding me to add this in.

                  2. Introduction and Character Bios

=======================================================================

After a great war hundreds of years ago, the Brood, a race of dragon
people, was forced to the brink of destruction. But Ryu, supposedly the
only survivor of the dragon race, was encased in chrysm ore for
centuries. After he reawakened from his long imprisonment and was
discovered in the Dauna Mine, he gets taken under the care of a poor
thief named Rei, who was already taking care of another orphan as well.
Ryu discovers his dragon descent shortly after being separated from
his friends, and on his journey to find out more about the ancient
dragons, he makes new friends and gains helpful and knowledgeable
allies. Later, Ryu must journey to see the god of the guardian race to
find out why his ancestors were destroyed.

~~~~~~~~~~
Characters
~~~~~~~~~~

Ryu-
Ryu is a blue-haired young man with a moral heart. He is the only known
survivor of the dragon race the Brood, and he uses his strength and
dragon abilities to help his companions. Ryu learns a good set of
healing and assist magic, and putting that together with his dragon
abilities make him the most valuable member of your party.

Teepo-
Teepo, like Ryu, is an orphan who is being taken care of by Rei.
Besides Rei, of course, he hates it when people tell him what to do,
and he is apathetic toward his thieving lifestyle. Although Teepo is
strong for is age, his arrogance does nothing but get him in trouble.
Teepo learns a decent set of attack spells that are very useful early
in the game.

Rei-
Even though Rei is a thief, he has a wholesome heart and doesn't like
the idea of hurting others. While taking care of Ryu and Teepo, Rei is
very responsible and always does what's in their best interest. He
appears to be holding back some kind of hidden power so that Teepo and
Ryu don't get hurt. Rei acquires a nice arsenal of electric spells and
learns some assist magic as well. Although his attack power is
miniscule compared to Garr's, his speed and incredible accuracy make
him a very strong party member.

Nina-
Nina is the princess of Wyndia, but she is getting tired of the royal
lifestyle and being controlled by her parents. At the beginning of her
travels with Ryu, she is a bit helpless in the face of danger and
thinks of Ryu as her hero, because he's always saving her from
dilemmas. Nina has little to say in the area of HP and physical
strength, but she naturally learns the most powerful attack spells of
anyone in your party and learns a few handy assist spells also.

Momo-
Momo is an independent scientist who knows just about everything about
machines and chrysm. She has a chrysm-powered assistant named Honey to
help her. Her extensive knowledge proves useful time and time again
while traveling with Ryu and his friends. Momo wields a huge bazooka as
her weapon and it packs a wallop, but it isn't very accurate. She
learns a few powerful attack spells, as well as some healing and assist
magic, making her a vital member of your final line-up.

Peco-
Peco is a little onion-like creature that was created from an
experiment at the Plant. Although he doesn't seem to have strong ties
with humans, he is very in-touch with nature, especially the Yggdrasil
tree. He learns a unique set of breath attacks and has the ability to
regenerate a small amount of HP every turn. Peco excels in HP and
defense, however he doesn't have much in the way of agility and
intelligence. But with some good master management, Peco can easily
become a great character to have in your team.

Garr-
Garr is a member of the guardian race, and has been the victor in the
Contest of Champions years running. When he meets Ryu, he seems
intrigued by his dragon abilities and seems to know more about the
ancient Brood than he lets on at first. Garr's attack power is like no
other, and he has HP to burn, making him the heavy artillery of your
party. He acquires a wide set of fire spells, but doesn't have the
intelligence level to put them to good use. Besides that, though, his
only downfall is his low agility.

              ----------------------------------------
              B. The Main Menu and World Map Interface
              ----------------------------------------

Pressing the square button while on the world map, in camp, or just
about anywhere outside of battle, can access the main menu. When you
access the main menu, you'll see a brief status screen for each of you
currently active party members, your game time, your total amount of
zenny (money), and a horizontal row of icons to choose from. From here
you can select icons to make decisions and customize your game:

"Vase" icon (items)- Here you can view all of your items, and your
weapon inventory. You can use, sort, and drop/toss items you don't
need.

"Rod" icon (abilities)- This is where you can view each party member's
abilities and magic spells. You can use an ability (such as a healing
spell) outside of battle, you can sort your abilities, and you can send
skills back to the skill notes. The dragon gene list can also be viewed
here.

"Sword" icon (equip)- Here you can view your currently equipped
weapons, armor, and accessories, and change your equipment by swapping
equipped items with weapons and armor from your inventory.

"3 Circles" icon (tactics)- Here you can change your party's battle
formation to your liking, and, if you're on the world map, you can
select Ally and change party members.

"Person" icon (status)- This is where you can see everyone in your
party's full status, including each person's stats, HP and AP, exp,
and equipped items.

"Controller" icon (configure)- Here you can configure the controls, and
customize your game.

"Tent" icon (camp)- Select this while on the world map to make camp.
While camping, you can rest, save your game, change party members,
check the master list, and change skill notes. You can also converse
with your party members while camping.

On the world map, there are some things that may pop up that all
players should be familiar with. The main thing you should know about
is the box that is always in the upper-left corner of the screen. In
the box, you should see: X- Enter, /\- Guide, and START- Camp. When
any of these words is highlighted in the box, you can press the
corresponding button to perform the button's function (Enter- enter
the area, Guide- get a brief description of the area, Camp- to set up
camp). Along with this, symbols should appear above Ryu's head:

[Name of place]- Usually appears when you are at a town, road, or a
fishing spot. The name of the place appears in a box overhead, and
Enter and Guide are usually highlighted.

! (Exclamation point)- Often appears while anywhere on the world map.
Indicates a random battlefield, and Enter should be highlighted.

[?]- Indicates an unnamed area that isn't a normal random battlefield
(although in some cases there aren't even any random battles to fight).
Enter and Guide should be highlighted.

? (Unboxed question mark)- Appears when you're standing on a ring of
flowers. These flower rings can be found all throughout the world but
don't come into play until later in the game.

                              ----------
                              C. Camping
                              ----------

You can set up a campsite just about anywhere on the world map by
pressing the Start button, or by selecting the Tent icon on the main menu.
While camping, you will be able to talk with all of your party members
(sometimes getting hints about where to go in the process), as well as
perform some other important functions. To access the camp main menu, go
inside your tent and examine the blue journal on the table:

Rest- Choose this to restore all of your party member's HP and AP.
Keep in mind that resting during camp will not restore any character
under the effect of Temporary Maximum Health Point Decline. To restore
TMHPD, you must rest at an inn. After resting, you will break camp as
soon as you leave the tent.

Save- This option lets you save your progress, it's as simple as that.

Change party members- Selecting this option allows you to switch out
your current party members.

Look at Skill Notes- This allows you to view and change all of the
skill abilities that you have learned. Select Look from the sub menu
to view and sort all of the skills you have in your Skill Notes list.
The Skill Notes list is simply where all of your skills that aren't
assigned to your characters are kept. If you select Change (Chng) from
the sub menu, you can reassign your skills. However, to do this, you
must have an item called Skill Ink. You can see how many Skill Inks
you have in the box labeled Ink. To change around your skills, simply
scroll from character to character using the d-pad and give them skills
from the Skill Notes list. To give a character a skill that another
character already has, put the skill on the Skill Notes list, and then
you may assign it to whomever you like. You can change around your
skills as much as you like using only one Skill Ink. However, don't
exit until you're completely done altering your skills, as you will be
forced to use another Skill Ink if you leave.

Look at Master List- Here you can view information about the various
masters that you've encountered throughout the game. To see a master's
stats, simply select that master by hitting X. Here you can also see
the master's location and the characters whom you have apprenticed
under that master. If a master has a star next to their name on the
list, then that means you have learned all of the skills they have to
offer.

                     -----------------------------
                     D. The Battle Menu and System
                     -----------------------------

Breath of Fire 3 has a turn based battle system that is common to many
RPG's. BoF3's battle system has everything expected of a stereotypical,
basic turned based system plus some other unique features as well (also
common in RPG's). The following are the icons that will appear at the
beginning of every turn in battle. Collectively, these make up the
battle menu, and they are arranged in a + shape. You must hold down a
directional button on the D-pad to highlight a battle icon.

"Sword" icon (middle)- This is the command to perform a normal attack.
Normal attacks don't consume AP and don't have any special affects by
themselves.

"Rod" icon (up)- By selecting this you can bring up the list of spells
and skills for that character and use these abilities. Most abilities
consume AP, so if you don't have enough AP, you can't use abilities.
For Ryu, you can access Accession on the ability list and transform
into a dragon.

"Shield" icon (right)- Select this and the character will go into a
defensive pose, lessening physical attack damage taken for the
remainder of the turn.

"Vase" icon (down)- Like on the main menu, this command lets you
access and use the items in your inventory, as well as change your
equipment.

"Eye" icon (left)- This is a feature that is completely unique from
any other game. By selecting this, the character carefully watches the
selected enemy and if the enemy uses a learnable skill during that
turn, the observer might learn it. The higher your intelligence and
overall level, the better chance you have of learning a skill while
examining. You cannot learn a skill that anyone in your party has
already learned or acquired. If you learn a skill while examining, an
exclamation point will appear over the person's head and a brief
message will follow. If you examine a skill that cannot be learned, a
question mark will appear over the person's head and a message will
come up saying that the skill can't be learned.

"Twin Swords" icon (brought up by holding down L1)- This commands
everyone in your party to use normal attacks until otherwise directed.
You can gain control again by pressing Triangle.

"Boot" icon (brought up by holding down R1)- You can flee battle by
using this escape icon. Escaping doesn't always work though; you won't
always escape on your first attempt. If your party fails to escape, the
enemy will get the rest of that turn to attack.

These icons will show up in the form of the battle menu every turn for
each member of your party. The name of the character that you are
commanding will appear above the battle menu. In the BoF3 battle
system, if any character in the battle (including enemies) has a
significantly higher level of agility than their opponent, they will
get an extra turn in which the opponent cannot attack. Extra turns are
marked by "Ex" in yellow letters next to the character's name above the
battle menu. If any characters have enough agility for an extra turn,
the extra turn will be granted after each regular turn. Outside of
battle, you can determine who gains the initiative right before you
fight by the !'s that appears over each character's head (assuming
there are three members in your party). Anyone who has the initiative
automatically gets an extra turn at the very beginning of the battle:

If 1 or 2 party members get !'s above their heads, than neither you or
your opponent will have the initiative.

If all 3 party members have !'s above their heads, than you'll have a
1 in 4 chance of having the initiative.

If no one in your party has an ! above their head, the opponent will
have a 1 in 4 chance of having the initiative.

Also, if a character dies in battle and is not somehow revived before
the battle ends, that character will fall victim to TMHPD (Temporary
Maximum Health Point Decline). TMHPD is a drop in the affected
character's maximum HP until he/she rests at an inn, not just by
camping. This temporary drop in max HP is marked by the character's HP
status highlighted in yellow on the main menu. TMHPD is temporary
because your original max HP can be restored, but once again, you can
only do this by resting at an inn.

                          --------------------
                          E. Battle Formations
                          --------------------

Although formations are really part of BoF3's battle system, I felt
that they deserved a section of their own, because there is much to be
said about them. First of all, formations are set positions that your
party members stand in during battle. Each formation yields different
effects on your party's stats, most often having one main positive
effect balanced out by a negative effect. For example, Defense
Formation increases your party's defense but lowers your party's
agility. So in essence, each fomation is a double edged sword. Using a
certain formation may give you an advantage in one situation, but put
you at a disadvantage in another. However, depending on your own
personal playing style and skill, you could very well just use one
formation throughout the entire game. Learning to properly use
formations may not be essential to beating the game, but it will prove
useful.

To change your formation, access the main menu, enter the Tactics
(three circles) menu, and select "Form". You'll now be at the formation
setup menu. On the right, you'll have up to six different formations
to choose from: Normal, Defense, Attack, Magic, Refuge, and Chain
(Note- The Magic, Refuge, and Chain formations can only be acquired by
the masters Lee, Wynn, and Bais respectively. See the Masters section
for more details). On the left, you'll see icons of your three current
party members, numbered 1, 2, and 3 from top to bottom. You can choose
both the formation you want and the order of your party members within
the formation.

In some formations, certain positions within the formation will have
effects unique from the other positions. For example, the character in
position number 1 in Attack formation will receive an increase in
attack power, while the other characters won't. In other words,
choosing the order of your characters in a formation can be just as
important as choosing the formation itself.

Now, here's some in-depth information about the effects of each
formation, as well as some of my own commentary about each one.

Normal Formation
----------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|           |
|   1   2   |
|     3     |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- None
         Def- None
         Int- None
         Agl- None

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 33%
Position 2- 33%
Position 3- 33%

Notes- Normal Formation is the only formation that has no special
effects. It doesn't enhance any stats, and likewise, doesn't hinder
any stats either. Also, as you can see from the information above, all
of your party members haven an equal chance of being attacked. Unless
you really don't want to worry about getting any of your stats
decreased, you should always use something other than normal formation.
Even in the early parts of the game, the Attack and Defense Formations
will be of much more use to you.

Defense Formation
-----------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|           |
|   2 1 3   |
|           |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- None
         Def- 25% Increase (All)
         Int- None
         Agl- 33% Decrease (All)

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 33%
Position 2- 33%
Position 3- 33%

Notes- This is probably one of the most useful formations in the game.
It substantially increases your defense by sacrificing a third of your
agility. So in this formation, you'll be a lot slower than normal, but
the boost in defense is usually worth it unless you're up against an
enemy that you need speed to beat. Although it's great to use
throughout the entire game if you prefer the tank-like playing style,
it's especially useful in the earier stages of the game when your
characters' agility is not all that high anyway.

Attack Formation
----------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|     1     |
|           |
|   2   3   |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- 70% Increase (Pos.1)
         Def- 20% Decrease (Pos.1)
         Int- None
         Agl- None

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 50%
Position 2- 25%
Position 3- 25%

Notes- This is another great formation to use, especially if you want
to deal some extra damage. Attack Formation will give you that and
then some! Obviously the benefit of this formation is to give the
character in the first position a monsterous increase in attack power.
However, that character is also much more likely to be attacked than
your other two party members. And since the point member also receives
a 20% decrease in defense, you can expect that character to take a lot
of damage. But that's not something that your other two characters
can't fix with healing, so all in all, this is an excellent formation.

Magic Formation
---------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|           |
| 1       2 |
|     3     |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- None
         Def- None
         Int- 40% Increase (Pos.3), 15% Decrease (Pos.1 and 2)
         Agl- None

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 40%
Position 2- 40%
Position 3- 20%

Notes- It doesn't get any better than this if you like spell-casters.
Put either Nina or Momo in the back of this formation and their magic
attacks will do a lot more damage. This is a great way to put an extra
edge on attacks like Myollnir. Not only that, but their healing spells
will be much more effective. This is especially nice for Momo. However,
while the back member gets a great magic boost, the magic of your
other two party members will be hindered. Also, your front two
characters will also take a majority of the hits, while your magician
will only have a 1/5 chance of being attacked.

Refuge Formation
----------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|     1     |
|   2       |
|       3   |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- None
         Def- None
         Int- None
         Agl- None

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 50%
Position 2- 25%
Position 3- 25%

Notes- There are not very many differences between this formation and
Normal Formation. It's description states that this formation will
cause your party to recover HP every round, and it does. However you
only recover 1 HP per round, which really doesn't help at all.
Otherwise, the only difference between Refuge and Normal Formation is
the distribution of enemy attacks against your party. In Normal
Formation, each character has an equal chance of being attacked, but
in this formation, the front member gets attacked much more often.
Since Refuge Formation doesn't give you any stat benefits, I wouldn't
suggest using it.

Chain Formation
---------------
 ___________
/Party Setup\
|   1       |
|     2     |
|       3   |
\___________/

Stat Effects:
         Pwr- None
         Def- 50% Decrease (All)
         Int- None
         Agl- All members have same Agl as the point member (Pos.1)

Chances of being attacked:
Position 1- 50%
Position 2- 30%
Position 3- 20%

Notes- The Chain Formation is very unique in the way that it can
provide stat benefits. In this formation the agility of the characters
in the second and third positions will be equal to the agility of the
character in the first position. For example, if the character in the
very front of the formation has an agility of 50, your other two party
members will also have an agility of 50. This formation was made to be
led by speed demons, so it would be a complete waste to have anybody
other than Rei or Nina lead it. But at the price of all of your
characters potentially having insane speed, your entire party's
defense is butchered. Needless to say, you'll take huge damage from
physical attacks in this formation. However, if you're fast enough to
defeat your foe before they get an opportunity to attack, then Chain
Formation has served its purpose perfectly. This is personally my
favorite formation to use.


=======================================================================

                           4. Rules of Thumb

=======================================================================

Here are just a couple of basic tips to get you off on the right foot:

If you're stuck on something, seek outside input- A cardinal rule in
every RPG is to talk to everyone you can, especially when you arrive
in a new town so you can get the scoop on what's going on. You can
almost always find out where to go or what to do by talking to
everyone you meet.

Use your camera angles- Adjust your camera angles often so you can see
behind every corner and ledge you come across so you don't miss any
hidden items. You will in some cases even have to use your camera
angles to find hidden objects vital to your progress.

Don't fight stubbornly- If you're clearly outmatched in a random
battle, run away or defend and heal. Don't just go on attacking if
your party is getting butchered or your offensive is having no effect.
There's a difference between being stubborn and being persistent.

Play the master system strategically- Be careful when selecting which
character you want to have study under each master. Make sure you
weigh the character's current status against the affects the master
will have on those stats. Also take into consideration anyone among
your group that might benefit from a master's special effects. There
are basically two ways to approach the master system, and they'll be
explained in more detail in the Masters section.

Don't limit yourself to a single style of fighting- This game has a
vast variety of enemies and situations for those enemies to appear in.
There is no single strategy that is effective against every enemy in
every kind of situation, so you must learn to adapt to many different
styles and strategies of fighting. This goes especially for bosses, and
at the end of the game, you'll want to develop several more different
strategies to use against the Challenge Monsters.

Get involved in the side quests- There are many side quests and mini
games in BoF3 to participate in. Most of these side quests you'll find
to be well worth your trouble once you reap the rewards.

A little leveling up never hurt anyone- If you've just lost to the
same boss for the second or third time, or if you are finding yourself
struggling against the random battles in a new area, then spend some
time increasing your level. There are plenty of benefits to leveling
up such as increasing your stats, gaining new skills from masters, or
acquiring a good item or weapon from a defeated enemy. The only
apparent downfall to leveling up is that it consumes time.

These tips will help you get through the game without having to read
the entire walkthrough.

=======================================================================

                          5. The Walkthrough

=======================================================================

Here's the walkthrough that will help you get through game if you get
stuck somewhere. I've divided up the major sequences of events into
chapters and have provided sub-chapters for each mission in each
chapter to make it easier to find what you're looking for. Most
sub-chapters will have item and enemy listings for that area. And
whenever I'm talking about a direction (e.g. left, right, up, down,
north, south, ect…), I mean your perspective of the screen (e.g. the
top of your screen = north/up).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                       I. Hoodlums in the Woods

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the caverns of Dauna Mine, two workers have been ordered to
detonate a large piece of chrysm ore. When the explosion goes off, the
baby dragon that was inside of it will be awakened. Immediately the two
workers will attack you and the battle menu will appear. Select Whelp
Breath under abilities to incinerate these foes. After you kill them,
you'll have control of the dragon. First go inspect the corpses of the
two fried workers to get the Melted Blade. Since there are no more
items to find throughout the rest of the area, you can basically just
leave through any of this room's exits. Once you leave the room,
follow paths going for the most part right and downward. Unless of
course you go down a side path with a dead end, all of the main paths
eventually empty out into the room you're heading for. If you
encounter anyone along the way who tries to fight you, just kill them
with Whelp Breath. Once you reach the room with the giant green skull
on the wall, you'll confront a big worker and have to fight him. Once
you try to use Whelp Breath, a voice will tell you to stop, and a
crane operator will knock you out. You'll now be captured, caged, and
put on a train heading east.

Once you regain control, shake the cage by moving the D-pad rapidly,
and the cage will come loose from the train cart. Meanwhile, down
below in Cedar Woods, you'll see that some fellow just missed out on a
meal because of some racket. He goes over to your crash landing site
and scares away some wolves that were eating you. This guy happens to
be Rei, a thief who lives in these woods. Even though Rei doesn't think
he can afford another mouth to feed, he takes you home with him anyway.
Teepo, another orphan Rei is taking care of, is waiting at home hoping
for some food when Rei gets back. They put you to bed and then leave to
let you get some sleep. You'll then have a strange and sort of
beckoning dream.

                         ----------------------
                         Cedar Woods and McNeil
                         ----------------------
Items:
Worm, Skill Ink, Ammonia, Green Apple (2), Healing Herb, Antidote,
Vitamin (2), Molotov

Enemies:
Boss Goblin, Eye Goo, Goblin, Gonghead, Mage Goo, Ripper

When you awake and gain control of Ryu, go over to the blue book in
the bedroom and save your game. Then proceed downstairs and pick up a
Vitamin and Worm from the cabinets there. Go out the front door and
follow the path around the house until you reach the dirt path going
down to a bridge. Cross the bridge and pick up a Skill Ink in the
treasure chest on the hill adjacent to the house and use your camera
angles to check behind the trees to the left of the chest to get an
Ammonia.

Return to the dirt path and take it to the left and then upwards to
reach the left exit of this area. Head back to the big tree where Rei
first found you and check behind it for a Green Apple. Take the path
south from there and pick up satchel containing another Green Apple
along the path. There are no more items to get in Cedar Woods so keep
going south into the next area and continue south from there until you
exit the woods and appear on the world map.

Go south on the world map until you reach a town called McNeil; enter
it. Right when you enter town you'll witness Rei and Teepo getting
chased out of someone's house. Once they see that you're finally out
of bed, Teepo proposes that you help them "work". Now head south a
little ways until you reach the weapon shop. Rei will go inside to get
you some equipment, but meanwhile when making conversation with Teepo,
he'll casually call you by your name. But how does he know your name,
weird isn't it? Once that's over Rei will come bolting out of the
weapon shop after snatching some equipment for Ryu, and all three of
you will head down to the farm just south of McNeil.

After waiting for Ryu to catch up, Rei and Teepo explain what they do
for work, which is mugging people at Yraall Road. Rei will suggest that
you go to Yraall Road to do some work right now. Now you have control
of the whole party and can bring up the main menu for the first time.
Before going to Yraall Road, though, I would suggest that you return to
the world map and enter some random battle sites to do some leveling
up and to get a feel for the battle system. Whenever your party gets
low on health though, make sure you make camp, rest, and save your
game. Once you accumulate a good amount of zenny (money), you can go
back to McNeil village to buy some new weapons, armor, or some items
to stock your inventory. Also make sure to check all of the houses and
buildings in McNeil for a Healing Herb, Antidote, and Molotov. There's
also a bag containing a Vitamin in the garden to the left of the inn.

McNeil Item Shop           McNeil Weapon Shop
-----------------          -------------------
Healing Herb- 10z          Ballock Knife- 100z
Croc Tear- 5z              Bronze Sword- 240z
Antidote- 12z              Leather Armor- 180z

Worm- 20z
Toad- 20z
Old Popper- 20z
Sinker- 20z

If you talk with some of the people in McNeil and at the farm you'll
find out that there's been a very poor harvest this year and also that
most people don't appreciate Rei and Teepo's line of work. Anyway,
once you've leveled up to about level 4 or so, head down to Yraall
Road.

                               -----------
                               Yraall Road
                               -----------
Items:
40z, Beef Jerky

Enemies:
Boss Goblin, Eye Goo, Goblin, Gonghead, Mage Goo, Ripper

Once you enter Yraall Road, take the path down until you reach the T
junction. There Rei and Teepo will spot a place for the three of you
to hide, so go over to that spot. In a little while you'll spot
someone coming, and since Ryu is hesitant to attack him, Teepo offers
him a great shove down the hill where Ryu slams into the guy. It turns
out that this is a guy named Bunyan, a very strong woodsman who lives
in the southeast corner of Cedar Woods. Bunyan just sort of shrugs off
this little attempt at robbing him, but he leaves Ryu with a threat to
Rei and Teepo. After a little suffering of defeat, Rei realizes that
if Bunyan is out here than that means there's no one guarding his
house. So it's decided that you go hit Bunyan's house. Before leaving
Yraall Road, make sure you pick up the satchel containing 40z near
your hiding place. Now head to the southern most entrance on the east
side of Cedar Woods (just above the little hut on the world map).

Once you enter Cedar Woods, just take the path downwards to reach
Bunyan's house. Switch Rei into the lead position and have him pick
the lock on the door. After you're inside the house and you gain
control of Ryu, go down the ladder in the northeast corner of the room.
Pick up the Beef Jerky from the cabinet down there. Now Rei and Teepo
will come down to see if you've found anything. Victory for finding
food, though, is short lived when you hear the door creak open
upstairs. Rei will go up to see what's going on, and after a
monkey-like scream, Teepo will follow. Now have Ryu go upstairs and
out the front door to get a free five-finger sandwich, complements of
Bunyan.

When you wake up, all three of you will be tied up and you'll get a
lecture about stealing. Bunyan will tell Rei to go to Mt. Glaus and in
the meantime, have Ryu and Teepo do some honest work for a change;
chopping wood. Listen to the directions Bunyan gives you and then
start the game. This wood chopping mini game is all about timing; once
you see the log tip, swing. You have to cut a certain amount of logs
within the time limit to gain freedom, but don't worry, because this
mini game is very easy and you should be able to win on your first try.
Once Bunyan sets you free, Teepo suggests that the both of you go up
to Mt. Glaus to meet up with Rei. Exit Cedar Woods and take the path on
the east side of the woods north until you reach a boxed "?" area on
the path. This is the road to Mt. Glaus.

                            -----------------
                            Road to Mt. Glaus
                            -----------------
Items:
Weather Vane, Vitamin, 120z, Coin, 80z

Enemies:
Eye Goo, Gonghead, Mage Goo, Man Trap, Puff Goo, Ripper

The road to Mt. Glaus is pretty short but don't rush through it because
there are a lot of useful items to pick up along the way. Start out by
crossing the bridge straight ahead and going right just a little ways
to see a huge boulder. Have Teepo kick out the small stone from under
the boulder so it will roll into the stream and dam it up. Now walk
right until you can enter the dried up stream. Go right and then
follow the path up that leads to a chest with a powerful Weather Vane
inside. Return to the area where the boulder initially was and take
the main path upwards. In the next area and throughout the rest of the
road you'll see rocks scattered on the ground. Make sure you have
Teepo kick over all of the rocks you see because some of them have
holes under them. Inspect the holes to find a Vitamin, 120z, and a
Coin. The main path goes northwest all the way to the exit, so continue
north until you find a chest under a tree containing 80z. From here
just head west until you reach the exit (Note- Once you make it through
this road once, you can just walk through it on the world map from now
on). If you need to rest or do any shopping at McNeil, now's the time.
After you've rested up and done any last minute leveling up, follow the
path the rest of the way to Mt. Glaus.

                        -------------------------
                        Mt. Glaus and the Caverns
                        -------------------------
Items:
Antidote, Heavy Caro, Cloth Shield, Vitamins, Bent Sword, Molotov,
200z, Ballock Knife, Talisman

Enemies:
Bat, Curr, Eye Goo, Gonghead, Mage Goo, Puff Goo, Ripper, Zombie

When you first enter Mt. Glaus, cross the big bridge and immediately
turn left and walk down to a path that doubles back to the right
toward the bridge. Pick up the Antidote in the bag and return to the
bridge. Head north until you reach a steep, light colored incline with
ledges sticking out of it. Go up the ramp to the immediate left of
this incline until you reach the top. You'll soon find out that if you
try to go down the light colored incline, you can only go down it, not
up it, and you can't maneuver while going down. To get the two
satchels on the ledges, you have to slide down the incline right above
the ledges. You don't have to guess at it though because there are
indentations in the incline that mark where the ledges are. Slide down
at the two right places to pick up a Heavy Caro and a Cloth Shield.
Once this is done, head right from the top of the incline and cross
the bridge there.

You'll then see the sun setting and Teepo decides that you should spend
the night in the cabin that's directly ahead. When you go inside the
cabin you'll find that Rei is staying there also. Rei explains that
there have been rumors of a monster living near Mt. Glaus, and that
Bunyan sent him here to kill the monster. After this discussion,
everyone agrees that they should get some sleep. In the morning,
you're awakened by a terrible noise. Go outside and you'll see the
monster, who looks like a monkey and chimera combined. It'll jump down
from the ledge to confront you and a fight will begin. Just hit it with
normal attacks and have Rei use Pilfer so you might be able to snatch
a Power Food from it. The Nue will run away after a few turns, so you
have to chase it down. Follow the path of broken trees to the right of
the cabin upwards and you'll see a cave entrance. Ignore it for now
and take the path going left all the way up to find a bag containing
Vitamins. Now it's time to hunt down the Nue, so return to the cave
entrance and proceed inside.

The caverns are pretty straight forward, considering that you have a
trail of blood to follow. Start up the trail and detour at your first
left and go through the passageway. Inside the sub cave, inspect the
huge pile of bones to find a Bent Sword. Also use your camera angles
to check the left side of the pile of a Molotov. Return to the blood
trail and follow it until it leads into a cavern to the left of the
main path. Enter the cavern and follow the path all the way up until
you see the blood trail end. Check the skeleton for 200z and exit the
cavern.

When you exit, Teepo will say that he thinks the monster jumped into
the water in that cavern to cover the trail. Once that's done, return
to the T junction in the main path and heat north off of the blood
trail. Take the path at the first right to a skeleton carrying a
Ballock Knife. Return to the main path and take the next right to a
skeleton you can inspect for a Talisman. Once again, return to the
main path but take the left trail at the very end of the main path and
enter the cavern there. Now Teepo will explain that if you jump into
the water from here, you can ride the current down to the spot where
the blood trail ended. So when you're ready to proceed, dive into the
water and the current will dump you out into a cave hidden behind the
waterfall. Now follow the trail of blood upwards until you confront
the Nue.

---------------
Boss fight: Nue
---------------
HP- 280
Exp- 96 / Zenny- 50 / Item- Power Food
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Teepo
Recommended level- 6
Notes- Like in most RPG's, the first boss is usually fairly easy to
beat, and the Nue is no exception. Just hit him with your normal
attacks, and if Teepo is at level 7 or higher, you can use Simoon to
make the battle ridiculously short. The only two attacks you have to
be aware of are Chlorine because it poisons, and Jolt because it does
about 10-15 damage to all of your party members. The Nue also has a
high reprisal rate so expect him to attack you more than once per turn.
***Extra Note- You can steal Power Food from the Nue twice with Rei's
Pilfer ability; during the battle when the Nue runs away, and during
this battle***
	
After the battle, inspect the Nue's body and you'll enter the cave it
was guarding. It turns out that the monster was bringing food to her
cubs, but she didn't know that the cubs were dead. Now exit the cave
and dive back into the water and the current will take you out of the
cave. Once you leave the cave, Bunyan will be waiting for you outside,
and he will commend your strength and bravery. After your conversation,
the scene will fade out and time will pass.

                               ----------
                               New Spring
                               ----------

With the Nue gone, there's been plenty of food now for everyone to
outlast the fall depression, and now that spring has arrived, a new
harvest has brought prosperity to the Yraall Region once again. After
Teepo returns from the woods with some food, he'll suggest that you all
go into town to hear what everyone's saying about them. If you haven't
already done so, go down to the storage room in your house to pick up
a Healing Herb and then head out of Cedar Woods and go to McNeil
village. When you arrive in town, it'll appear deserted (it seems that
Teepo's been letting his ego run loose lately). But then people will
start coming out the their homes with shovels, rakes, and sickles in
hand, but don't worry because they're just farmers. A crowd will gather
around you, and the village elder will come and commend your efforts
to save the town from the Nue. The crowd will then disperse and life
will go on as usual, except now the people in town will treat you with
the up most respect.

Now that it's spring, you now have some new areas to explore in the
Yraall Region. Buy a Wooden Rod and some fishing lures from the McNeil
item shop and go enter the fishing spots along the river to the west.
Fishing is the first side quest you can experience and even at this
point in the game it has its rewards (for more on fishing see the
Fishing section under side quests). Also check out the new [?] area
northwest of McNeil to find the game's first master, Mygas. Make sure,
though, you spend all of your zenny at McNeil before talking to Mygas
(to learn more about him and all of the other masters check out the
Masters section). Now's also a good time to do some leveling up along
side of fishing.

You've probably noticed that after you killed the Nue and the people
congratulated you and everything, there's been a shifty looking
character in a green cloak following you around whenever you visit
McNeil. Once your party is at level 8 or so, talk to this guy. It
turns out his name is Loki, and he starts right off saying how strong
and brave you are, but he'll beat around the bush a little bit before
he asks you for a favor. Say that you'll help him and he tells you to
meet him in the shed down at the farm.

Make sure that you have a good supply of healing items and zenny
before you go to see Loki, but once you're ready, head down to the
farm and enter the hut on the right side of the path going south. When
you enter, Loki will explain that Mr. McNeil, the mayor of McNeil
village, has been overtaxing the villagers, and he thinks that you
should take back some of the tax money and return it to the villagers.
Teepo, of course, agrees immediately and is followed by the slightly
reluctant Rei and Ryu. Loki suggests that you should go tonight, so
the scene will then end and night will fall.

                          --------------------
                          Outside McNeil Manor
                          --------------------
Items:
Vitamin, 50z, Firecracker

Enemies:
Pooch, Rocky

When you arrive just outside of McNeil manor, your party will split up
looking for a way to get in. First, follow the path you're on upwards
and search inside the hut on the side of the path for a Vitamin. Exit
the hut and detour to the north off the path until you come to the
outer wall of the manor. Walk along this wall until you find a section
of the wall that stands out from the rest of the wall and examine it.
Rei and Teepo will join you, and when Rei leans against the newly
fixed section of wall it'll topple over, giving you guys a way in.

When you get in you'll find the place swarming with guards. First,
search behind the hedge to the left to find a guy who looks like Loki
who gives you 50z for keeping quiet about him to the guards. Exit the
ledge and continue upwards until you confront a guard who, realizing
he's no match for you, let's you pass for 50z. Pay him and continue
straight ahead and go up the stairs. Head left from the top of the
stairs and use your camera angles to check behind the corner there to
find a wallet. Go right past the stairs and give the guard standing
there his lost wallet and he'll let you go by. Keep going right and
then head down the stairs, making sure not to let yourself be seen by
the guards holding lanterns (because if a lantern guard sees you,
you'll get thrown out and you'll have to pay the initial guard another
50z). Now go south until you reach a tower with a bell on it, so climb
up the tower and use Ryu's sword to ring the bell. This will cause a
lantern guard to leave his post so you can walk by, so climb down the
tower and go right until you reach a courtyard.

Speak with the guard who's sitting in the middle of the courtyard
smoking, and he'll tell you to take out the guard dog keeping watch at
the front gate so it'll look like the dog's fault if you break in and
not his (it seems that half the guards here are nothing but slackers).
Take the path south from there to fight the Pooch (Note- You can have
Rei steal a Vitamin off the Pooch). Make short work of the dog and
continue to the right from the courtyard and double back around the
hedge downwards of you to find two people eloping behind it. Talk to
them and then talk to guard who's standing in front of the shed to the
right of the hedge. He'll leave his post when you tell him what's
going on so enter the shed he was guarding.

It turns out to be a chicken coop, and when Teepo tries to steal some
eggs, a big a** rooster named Rocky will come out and give you some
attitude. The fight with Rocky isn't too hard just watch out for his
Ovum attack (Note- You can have Rei snatch a Life Shard from Rocky).
Once you've dealt with Rocky, the chickens will go crazy, and almost
all of the guards will be too busy chasing chickens to notice you
sneaking around. From the coop, go up following the wall to the right
until you reach a stair set. Go up the stairs and head left to find a
chest containing a Firecracker. Now go back to the courtyard and cut
through it to the left and go up the stairs. Then head right towards
the main door to find it heavily guarded. Rei decides to act as a
diversion so that Ryu and Teepo can sneak in the front door and meet up
with him later. Once Rei leads the guards away from the door, Ryu and
Teepo enter McNeil manor.

                           -------------------
                           Inside McNeil Manor
                           -------------------
Items:
Gems, Vitamin, Panacea, MultiVitamin, Healing Herb, 600z, Swallow Eye,
Broad Sword

Enemies:
Bat, Doksen, Galtel, Guard, Kassen, Roach, Torast, Volt

When you first enter the house, go right and enter the door there to
wind up in a room full of portraits hung on the walls. You'll both
start to receive some bad vibes from this place so exit this room and
walk to the large stairway in the middle of the hall. A strange force
will stop you from going up the stairs, and then a ghost will appear,
telling you that he is a spirit of one of the old McNeil's, and he
doesn't want you to challenge the McNeil clan. Torast will then
challenge you to a fight. Just use your strongest attacks against him
when you can because Torast tends to use Sleep a lot (Note- If you've
acquired the Sliver Knife by fishing you can do serious damage to
ghosts with it).

Once you defeat Torast head up the big stair set and take the path
right. Go down and enter the doorway to the right and collect the item
in the room above you (Remember to use your camera angles to find
cabinets hidden behind walls). Now return to the top of the big
stairway, but this time go left. Walk through the doorway on the left
and pick up Gems in the 2nd room (going right to left) below you and a
Vitamin in the 2nd room above you. Head out the north end of the room
with the Vitamin to confront Mr. McNeil, or so you think. Ryu sees
through this McNeil ghost's disguise and reveals him to be the ghost
of Kassen McNeil. Fight Kassen, who shouldn't be any harder than
Torast, and then continue to the right down this hall.

Enter the room below you at the end of the hall and check the drawers
for a Panacea. Try to go down the stairs in this room, but you'll be
halted by Galtel, another McNeil ghost. Eliminate him and continue
down the stairs. From here, walk to the left past the beds and collect
a MultiVitamin from the drawer. Continue through the lower doorway and
through the next doorway as well. Head left and get a Healing Herb in
the kitchen drawer and continue left and go up the stairs to find 600z
in the bedroom. Go back down the stairs and enter the lower hallway to
confront another ghost, Doksen. Teepo seems to be getting tired of all
the talkative ghosts so he cuts right to the chase. Once you've taken
care of Doksen, continue down the hallway and head right after entering
the next room. Take the elevator there up and then go up the next
stair set to find a room where you can rest and save your game. After
you've rested up, go up the ladder to reach the roof.

Now that you're finally on the roof, go up and to the left until you
get to the end of the roof. On the incline of the roof you'll see green
moss that, like the slope at Mt. Glaus, lets you slide down but not up.
Slide down the roof's side in the right spot to get the grappling hook.
Once this happens Rei will show up, and now that you've found his
grappling hook, you can cross over to the adjacent roof where Mr.
McNeil is.

After a little guilt trip, courtesy of Teepo, head upwards and walk
down any of the narrow stairways slanting down the roof (Also make
sure to check behind the chimney stacks on both roofs to find a Broad
Sword. Thanks to my brother for finding this one). Go up the narrow
gutter-like area on the edge of the roof to find a satchel containing
a Swallow Eye. Now return to the area where you crossed over from the
other roof, search for a ladder (not a staircase) going down into the
house, and head down it. Check this area for items and then return to
the roof. Now search for a staircase going down into the house and
walk down it to enter Mr. McNeil's bedroom. After barging in on his
fun, you'll have Mr. McNeil cornered and cowering, but then the ghosts
that you defeated (plus another that you didn't fight) will appear and
they will fuse into one big ghost in an attempt to prevent you from
destroying the dignity of the McNeil clan. It's time to fight the
McNeil's once and for all.

-------------------
Boss fight: Amalgam
-------------------
HP- 550
Exp- 210 / Zenny- 200 / Item- Magic Shard
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Teepo
Recommended level- 9
Notes- Amalgam isn't too tough to beat, but this fight will take a
little longer than the fight with the Nue. Just have Rei stick to his
regular attack and Pilfer, Teepo should use Simoon, and Ryu should just
use regular attacks and heal the party when needed. This guy's a ghost,
so any regular attack by someone equipped with the Silver Knife is
going to do major damage. The only attack you need to watch out for is
Astral Warp, which can do 15-20 damage to a single character.

Once you defeat Amalgam, you'll walk in and steal the money easily
from the sobbing Mr. McNeil, but through his tears he makes a
threatening promise of revenge.

                                ---------
                                Aftermath
                                ---------

Later, back at your home in Cedar Woods after you've left some of
McNeil's money at everyone's doorstep, Teepo thinks that the three of
you should go into town again to see the reaction of the town's people.
Make sure you've collected all of the items in your house and then
head over to McNeil. Talk to the people in town, and you'll find out
that everyone is mad at you again for stealing, and also that they all
gave the money back to Mr. McNeil.

Now that this plan blew up in your face, go down to the farm and talk
to Loki, who's hiding behind a cart to the side of the road. He appears
to be a bit paranoid about people hearing their conversation so he asks
you to meet him in the hut again. Go to the hut and wait for Loki, but
instead of him, Bunyan comes in with a cow. Bunyan will indirectly tell
you that Loki didn't know until now that Mr. McNeil has strong ties
with a mafia group who didn't appreciate getting stolen from, uh oh!
Now that he's got things figured out, Rei suggests that you all should
get back home as quickly as possible to lie low until this whole thing
gets forgotten. When you exit the hut, Loki is nowhere to be found, so
when you're ready, head back to your house in Cedar Woods. When you
return to your home, you'll find it set on fire, and you'll also find
the two arsonists as well. News got out fast and the gang of crooks
McNeil works for already sent two of their toughest guys, Balio and
Sunder, to kill you. Unless your level is something amazing, your party
will be wiped out in about three turns, so don't waste any items in
this battle (although you can have Rei use Pilfer to try to snatch an
item or two off of them).

***Note- This is the most controversial battle in BoF3. If you want to
know more about this controversy, please refer to the Balio and Sunder:
The Age Old Question section.***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                     II. The Balio and Sunder Saga

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When Ryu regains consciousness, he finds himself in a bed inside a
familiar house. Get out of bed and head out the front door to find
Bunyan waiting for you. He says he found you hurt in the woods...
alone. It looks like the worst is to be expected of Rei and Teepo, but
Ryu believes that they're still alive somewhere. You tell Bunyan that
Rei and Teepo wanted to go to Wyndia so he suggests that you head east
to Mt. Myrneg. Take his advice, exit Cedar Woods, and head east from
Yraall Road to reach Mt. Myrneg (Note- After you've visited the
mountain once, go back to Cedar Woods and talk to Bunyan, and he'll
become a master).

                               ----------
                               Mt. Myrneg
                               ----------
Items:
Icicle, Protein, Bat Amulet, 200z

Enemies:
Nut Mage, Nut Troop, Ripper, Tar Man

When you first enter Mt. Myrneg, take the path to the right and talk
to the Tarman named Tallman standing on the path next to a chest
containing an Icicle. He'll tell you about enemy weaknesses. After you
speak with him, pick up the Icicle and continue right around the first
corner and head up the ladder there. Go to the right until you reach a
ladder going down. Head down the ladder and take the path right and
check around the trees for a satchel containing a Protein. Now go back
up the nearest ladder going up. Walk to the right and take the ladder
farthest to the right up to a small precipice with another ladder
going up; take this ladder up too. Now take the half hidden path on
the right to get the Bat Amulet from the chest there.

Go back down the two ladders you just took and head left. Take the
first ladder you come across up and then go right to another ladder at
the end of the path. Climb that ladder and go left up the path (ignore
the first ladder to the right of the path) and walk down onto a rock
peninsula and pick up the 200z in the bag there. Now go up the ladder
you ignored earlier and take the next path up and to the left to reach
the last ladder. Climb it and go right to see half the horse duo,
Sunder, taking a wiz. Try to get by, and he'll turn around and see you.
Sunder gets scared and calls for Balio to come over and help him. Balio
figures that they didn't finish you off after your last encounter, so
Sunder draws his sword and shafts you right through the back. You then
turn into a dragon, and Balio will get the idea to make some money off
of you.

Balio and Sunder capture you and cart you the rest of the way to
Wyndia, where they'll request a hearing before the king of Wyndia. The
thugs will go before the king, telling him that they've captured a
dragon, but when the cage is unveiled, Ryu has turned back into a boy
again. Thinking the three of you are con artists, the king will have
you locked up in the dungeon.

                             ---------------
                             Wyndian Dungeon
                             ---------------
Items:
Skill Ink

You're sent to the dungeon and they lock you up in a cell, and Balio
and Sunder in another cell. After taking some lip from the horse duo,
Nina, the princess of Wyndia, comes in and says she'll let you out
because she sorry for the way you were treated. Balio and Sunder lie
to convince Nina to bail them out to, and she does... bad move! She
lets them out first and they capture her so they can get a ransom.
You're left in the dungeon by yourself, so go up to the cell door and
examine it. You will now get some options of what to do. Choose to try
to break the door down. Your first attempt will fail, but the door will
fall down after you ram it twice. Now head right and pick up the Skill
Ink from Balio and Sunder's cell (save your game at the journal also).
Then follow the path down and through the barred door and go down the
stairs. Continue down the stair sets and take the path down to confront
Balio and Sunder.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Flame)- After breaking out of the dungeon, you
automatically gain your first gene, which is the Flame gene.

They decide to deal with you before worrying about the princess, so
now you fight Balio and Sunder. Before you attack them, use a Healing
Herb on Nina so she can escape the battle, and then go up to abilities
to find that you've acquired the Accession (dragon transformation)
ability. Select the Flame gene, the only gene you have right now, and
turn into a flame Whelp. Use Flame Breath until the horses begin to
run away, that is if you're at a higher level than average. If you're
at a low level, you probably won't be able to beat them, but that's ok
because you don't have to win this fight (although if you manage to
win, you'll get 110 Exp).

After the battle, win or lose, Balio and Sunder will have dispersed
and Nina will thank you for helping her. She tells you that there's a
way to the city through the Catacombs, and so Nina will join your
party of one. Now walk down the path and head down the stairs to reach
the Catacombs.

                            -----------------
                            Wyndian Catacombs
                            -----------------
Items:
Glass Domino, Panacea, Wisdom Fruit

Enemies:
Ghoul, Nut Mage, Nut Troop, Thunder, Volt, Zombie

As you first enter the Catacombs, head left and take the concrete path
(that seems to be just hovering in the darkness) to a tombstone.
Examine it, and it'll tell you about the tombstone puzzle of these
Catacombs. Push the "7" on that tombstone and return to the area near
the entrance and then head right to reach an area with seven normal
tombstones and one big one. The seven smaller tombstones are scattered
around the floor in this area, and the big tombstone is up on a
platform which you can access by ladder. All of the seven smaller
tombstones have two words on them that you can push like a button.
Push the wrong word and you will fall through the floor and have to
climb back up to the staring area again (that's how you obtain the
Glass Domino that's on the raised platform near where you start). Here
are the correct buttons to press:

"Above or Beneath"- Above
"Climbing or Outside"- Outside
"This or That"- That
"Look or Secrets"- Secrets
"Green or Red"- Green
"I or You"- You
"Is or Not"- Not

Once you've hit all of these switches (and picked up the Panacea in
the chest at the bottom of the ladder south of the "Green and Red"
tombstone), climb the ladder up to the big tombstone and examine it.
You'll find that it has seven different sets of buttons to press, so
here's the correct buttons to hit in each set: Red, Climbing, I, Is,
Look, Beneath, This. If you hit all the correct switches, you'll fall
through the floor and land in a small area. Walk down a few steps to
fall through a hidden hole in the floor. Nina now tells you that you
can reach the city from here. Ryu explains that he's looking for Rei
and Teepo, so Nina offers to help you look for them. Continue south
from here to this area's exit, but make sure to check behind the
tombstones to the left to find a chest with a Wisdom Fruit inside. Go
south in the next area to exit the Catacombs.

                                 ------
                                 Wyndia
                                 ------
Items:
Healing Herb, Ammonia, Moxa, Bread (4)

As you'll soon find out, Wyndia is a very up-beat, peaceful, and large
city (It makes McNeil village look like nothing). Explore every area
in town you can to find a Healing Herb, Ammonia, Moxa, and Bread X4.
At the ground level of town, there's a couple of weapon and item shops
and an Inoculation shop, where you can receive injections that will
protect you against certain types of attacks, and even status changes.
But the higher your level, the higher the price for each injection,
and the effects of the injection wear off after you rest. Near the
Inoculation shop, you'll find some kids playing near a fountain. Talk
to the leader of the kids and he'll get you to play a game of Hide and
Seek. Nina thinks that if you both play, the kids might tell you if
they know anything about Rei and Teepo. Here are the hiding places of
the kids:

-Behind the trees near the Inoculation shop
-Behind the left wall near the city's entrance
-Behind the weapon shop near where the bum is sitting
-Behind the tree in the café area

After you've found them all, the leader will tell you that he saw some
kid rob a man's house here in town, and that he ran off down the road
afterwards. So now it's time to go down to Eygnock Road to look for
your friends. Before you leave town, though, check out the shops here
in Wyndia, and if you got a couple thousand zenny to spare, consider
buying some new weapons and armor. If you have little money, save it
because you can get supplies cheap in the next town.

After you're finished in Wyndia, exit the city and head south to
Eygnock Road. When you arrive there, walk south on the path to the
house and go inside. As Ryu walks inside, you'll hear Nina scream, so
pick up the Clothing from the dresser and return outside to find the
horse duo, Balio and Sunder. You can't do anything to stop them this
time so they knock you out and capture you again. The two of you are
then taken to a rowdy town called Genmel.

                            -----------------
                            Arena Town Genmel
                            -----------------
Items:
80z, Flier

When you arrive in Genmel, Balio and Sunder tie you both up and leave
you under the watch of a bartender named Fahl, because they have more
important things to do than look after a bunch of kids. After they
leave, Ryu decides to try to chew through the ropes that bind him, and
he's successful (but you can't see how with that screen in the way).
Now that the two of you are unbound, you can make an easy escape from
the bar, especially since Fahl has had too much to drink.

*** Without Flier / With Flier ***

Once you have escaped, explore the town (you can find 80z in one
building, I think it's the inn) and talk to the people around here.
Everyone in town is getting psyched up for the upcoming Contest of
Champions, a fighting tournament run by Balio and Sunder. It also
appears that Fahl, the bartender, knows some good fighting techniques,
but he's too busy drinking to teach them to anybody. If you explore
the southwest corner of town and check behind the wall there, you'll
find a fish merchant handing out Fliers that can give you a discount
at the stores just north of him. Pick up a Flier from him and then
check out the weapon and item shop. Once you've taken care of
everything in town, exit the town and head north to the Maekyss Gorge.
When you get there, you'll find that the bridge is blocked so you're
going to have to go the long way around to Wyndia through the
mountains. So go back down south and head east past the arena to reach
Mt. Boumore.

                               -----------
                               Mt. Boumore
                               -----------
Items:
Panacea, 400z, Buckler, Bent Sword, Life Shard

Enemies:
Gonger, Nut Archer, Nut Mage, Nut Troop, Orc, Tar Man

From the entrance, take the only path up a little ways and walk to the
right of the first small ramp you see. Pick up the Panacea from the
chest there, and then go up the ramp you just passed. From there, walk
to the right and up the next small ramp and then head left. At the
first junction, go left until you reach another junction. At this
junction head down the upper left path to find a satchel containing
400z behind the corner. Return to the top of this path and walk
upwards to a small ramp on the left near a long narrow ledge you can
jump off of. Go up this ramp and then climb up the ladder.

Head up the path (make sure to ignore the people and their house on
the left of the path for now) until you come to a ledge you can jump
off of at the end of the trail. Jump off this ledge and then the next
ledge also to get the Buckler. Jump off the left side of this ledge
and return to the top area where you saw the people before. Talk to
the fat guy, and he'll invite you in. Once inside, Nina will tell Mr.
Mason that two guys named Balio and Sunder are after you. Mr. Mason
will pretend not to know who they are, and he lets you stay the night
at his house. Pick up the Bent sword from the dresser in the house and
then go into the next room to rest.

The next morning when you wake up, you'll find that you've been locked
in, and nobody's coming to let you out. Meanwhile, Sunder shows up at
the house to capture you again (it looks like you've been betrayed).
Exit north from this room to reach the lift area. Nina tells Ryu to
get on the lift while she tries to activate the panel with her wand.
Now Sunder enters the scene, but when he tries to capture you, Ryu will
give him a well deserved swipe with his sword. Now Nina manages to get
the lift working, and she jumps onto the lift at the last second.
You're safe for now.

When the lift finally stops, exit the lift station and head right.
Walk down the path past the locked gate to the right and take the path
not sloping up to a Life Shard inside a satchel. Now head up the path
sloping upward to the topmost area. There you'll find a dead end, and
then Sunder will come up from behind you and have you trapped. Just
when you think the jig is up, Nina decides that you both should jump.
You'll then jump and slide down the side of the mountain. Ryu puts
himself in front of Nina and turns into a dragon to break her fall
(This will net Ryu the Defender dragon gene). Once you have control
again, leave this area to return to the world map.

**NEW DRAGON GENES (Defender and Reverse)- You receive the Defender
gene automatically after escaping from Sunder. Back on the world map,
head south from your current location to reach a [?] area. Enter this
area to find a large purple crystal on the ground. Have Ryu examine it,
and he'll obtain the Reverse gene.

Return to the world map and go up and to the right to reach the Tower.

                              ------------
                              Momo's Tower
                              ------------
Items:
MultiVitamin, Wisdom Fruit, Ring of Ice, Silver Knife, Skill Ink,
Flame Chrysm, Ice Chrysm, 800z, Moon Tears, Breastplate, Ivory Dice,
Bamboo Rod

Enemies:
Armor Bot, Gonger, Hyper Bot, Ice Toad, Lizard, Orc, Proto Bot

Enter the Tower and Nina will suggest that you both go inside to find
someone who can help you get to Wyndia. If you're low on healing items
make sure you buy some supplies from the fish merchant. Now, head left
and up the big stair set and then walk past the pool with the chest in
it to it's left. Go through the doorway directly left of the pool.
From here, go up the path and pass the big crystal near the end of the
room (unless you want to try the crystal challenge; explained in Side
Quests) and go up the stairs to the left.

Walk right down this next hall but detour through the big doorway at
the bottom of the path. Now go down the small stair set and veer right
to pick up a Silver Knife from behind the tree. Return inside the
Tower the same way you came out and continue right down the hall and
exit through the door at the end of the room. Head up this hallway and
up the big stair set on the left side of the hall. Walk to the right
to reach a rest and save room, so use this place as needed. After
you've rested up, exit the save room and head left to the end of the
room and go up the stairs in the northwest corner of the room.

Take this next hallway right and then upwards at the end to see a
little pink thing walk out of the next room and brace itself for an
explosion. Go inside the room to find a scientist named Momo amongst a
huge mess. Once you're able to converse with her without yelling at
each other (her ears were ringing from the explosion), you'll ask her
how to get to Wyndia from here. Better than just tell you, Momo offers
to escort you there personally. Momo leaves for a minute to get some
things from the merchant outside, but when she gets back, she'll tell
you that there are some tough looking guys outside looking for you.
Now the only way to escape is to head to the top of the Tower where
Momo has an emergency escape. So now Momo joins your party.

Once you're in control again, exit this room and head up the hall.
Enter the very next door on the left to reach the panel puzzle room.
In order to unlock the door in this room you have to make all the
panels in the puzzle gray. A panel's color will change if you step on
it. You can't walk directly backwards and the puzzle resets itself if
you step off it. For more info on this, read the puzzle description
that's on the wall near the bookshelf. There are many ways to solve
the puzzle and this is one of them (the order in which to step on the
panels):

Once you've solved the puzzle, go through the door that just unlocked
to enter a room with three chests just for you (they contain Skill Ink,
Flame Chrysm, and Ice Chrysm). Now exit back into the main hallway and
continue along the path and walk up the stairs on the left.

From here, head right and go down to the small stair set. Walk up these
stairs and head left until you come to a door leading to the next room;
go through it. You'll now be in a room with four 3-D cubes lined up
across the floor with switches under them. You must hit the switches
of the two cubes that are exactly alike (from left to right it's the
2nd and 4th cubes). If you don't hit the right switches, you'll fall
through the floor. Now, continue to the other end of this room and
head up the next stair set and walk left to a passageway. Take the
hall right to another set of stairs. Go up the stairs and through the
next door.

You'll end up in a room that's broken up into four sections, has two
pairs of red and blue switches, and has red and blue platforms floating
in the void that separates the four sections. The switches correspond
to the floating platform of the same color, so you have to hit the
switches to move the platforms to form a bridge across the pit (don't
worry, it's easy to figure it out). Hit the switches so that you have
access to the door in the right corner of the area. Head through this
door and pick up the 800z in the 2nd room you enter. Now go back to the
room with the switches and flip the switches so that you can reach the
northernmost area. The path from there is pretty straightforward, just
follow it to the end of the two hallways to reach a chest containing
Moon Tears. Once again, go back to the switch room and hit the switches
to reach the stairs in the easternmost area. Walk up the stairs. Now,
take the hall right and then downwards to reach a stair set going up;
head up those stairs.

From here, head up the stairs to the right and walk to the right until
you see a floating platform. Get on the platform and it will take you
to another part of the room. Once you get off the platform, head up the
next stair set and follow the path to reach a big crystal. If you read
the instructions on the wall, you'll find out that this crystal
controls the floating platform that's near it. It runs on chrysm
energy, so use Nina's wand to charge up the crystal. The more times
you hit the crystal with Nina's wand, the farther the platform will go
before it comes back to where it starts. Hit it two times to reach a
chest with a Breastplate, and six times to get a chest with an Ivory
Dice. Hit it eight times to reach the stairs in the upper left corner
of the room. Go up those stairs, head down the hall, and climb up the
stairs at the end of the hall. Now head left and enter the first door
you see to get a Bamboo Rod. Exit back into the hall, walk up the
stairs to the left, and walk up the next set of stairs after that.

You'll now be in a room with laser beams and a purple crystal in the
middle of the room. Walk up near the crystal and make sure all of your
party members are past the first little machine that looks just like
the one that's currently emitting a laser. Hit the crystal with Nina's
wand and the middle laser machine will be turned off, and the first
and last laser machines will turn on. Make everyone in your party walk
past the middle laser machine and then hit the crystal with chrysm
again to turn the middle laser back on, and the outside lasers off,
allowing you to continue on.

Go through the door at the end of the room to reach a library. This was
where Momo's father did all of his experiments, so Momo suggests that
you look for the escape device. First check the shelves in the upper
right corner of the room to get 40z and a Panacea. Now examine the
control panel in the upper middle part of the room (from the operators
end) to find a button that unveils a huge rocket. Momo thinks this is
the escape device so you all get on and shoot out the top of the tower
and make a crash landing.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Thorn)- After you recover from the crash (and after
Momo finds the instruction manual for the rocket), look near the trees
next to where you landed to find the Thorn gene. Now exit the crash
site onto the world map.

                             The Coffee Shop
                             ---------------
Items:
Vitamin

If you head north on the world map, you'll come to a little place
called the Coffee Shop. Enter the Coffee Shop and then take the path
up to where the café area is. Once your party sees the restaurant, the
three of you will decide to take a load off here of a bit. While you're
resting, you find out that the road to Wyndia and the Eastern
Checkpoint have both been blocked off by Balio and Sunder's men. In
the midst of trying to think of what to do now, an old man comes over
to you and starts talking to Momo. It turns out that this guy's name
is Palet, and he runs a plant where crops are grown using chrysm
energy; the same plant where Momo's father used to work. He explains
that there are some problems down at the Plant, and Momo agrees to help
out (you got nothing else to do anyway because the roads are blocked).
After your talk with Palet, go inside the Coffee Shop building and
pick up a Vitamin in one of the drawers in there.

If you have 15 different weapons in your inventory, not counting your
equipped weapons, go talk to the tough looking girl on the hill
overlooking the Coffee Shop. She's a thief named D'lonzo, and she will
let you apprentice under her if you have 15 different weapons. Once
you're done here, exit the Coffee Shop and head west on the world map
to find the Plant.

                               ---------
Items:
Ginseng, Healing Herb

When you first arrive at the Plant head left to find a conveyor belt
sloping up but running downwards. Flip the switch right next to it and
ride the conveyor up. Head right and up the incline and then ride the
next conveyor up and to the left. Walk up the narrow path and then to
the right. Head up the incline next to the crates and take the
conveyor going left. Go past the next chrysm reactor and take the next
conveyor going left. Walk down past the next reactor and hit the switch
near the next conveyor so that it runs south. Ride this conveyor and
head right to yet another conveyor going downwards. Take it down to
find Palet.

Talk to him with Momo as the lead character, and he'll tell you that
there's nothing wrong with the machines here, but during an experiment,
an onion-like mutant was created. Palet will tell you that there's been
a problem with a big mutant down at the Dump, so he asks you to help.
You accept, of course, so Palet sends word to the Dump about your
visit. Now go inside the metal building near where Palet is and grab a
Ginseng and a Healing Herb from the drawers inside. Once you're done
here, exit and just slide down the incline at the southwestern part of
the area and leave the Plant. If you haven't rested and saved since
Momo's Tower, you better do that now. After you're rested up, enter
the Dump that's a stone's throw west of the Plant.

After you arrive there, take the path to the south and then downwards
at the corner. Make the U-turn around the inside wall and head up the
path until you reach a T-junction. Detour to the right off the main
path at this junction and walk upwards a little ways to find a blue
switch. Hit this switch three times and pick up the chest with 1200z
in the alcove directly north of you. Now return to the Dump's entrance,
but this time head to the north up the path. Walk up the ramp past the
giant crates and then go left. Follow the 2nd catwalk down and cross
over the crate to get a chest containing High Boots. Jump off the
catwalk near the chest and continue up the path. Walk past the crates
and exit this area through the cavern on the left.

Take the next path left and then head down the small ramp at the end.
Walk down this path and take the 2nd right to an area with a red and
blue switch and a big lava pit at the end of the conveyor belt. Hit
the red switch eight times and head back up the path you just came
down. Take the first junction you come to right and then go up the
ramp to the left past the conveyor belt. Head down the path and cross
the path made by the crates to get the much needed Artemis' Cap. Now go
all the way back down to the area with the red and blue switches. Take
the path going around the lava pit counter clockwise and pick up the
Magic Shard in the chest along the path. Continue around the lava pit
until you come across a cave with plants growing out of it. Go inside
to find the mutant that Palet was talking about. After some idle chit
chat, the mutant will go out of control and attack you.

------------------
Boss fight: Mutant
------------------
HP: 550
Exp- 600 / Zenny- 300 / Item- N/A
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Nina
Recommended level- 13
Notes- The Mutant isn't very tough, especially since you now have
dragon abilities to use against bosses. The only hard part is that at
the beginning of the fight, the Mutant can regenerate 250 HP per turn.
But as you'll soon find out, this guy is extremely weak against fire
attacks. So have Momo equip her Flame Chrysm, have Nina use Simoon,
and have Ryu pound away with Flame Claw in Dragon form (Flame,
Defender, and Thorn genes) After a few turns of punishment, the Mutant
will lose it's ability to regenerate. Now just continue attacking with
fire based attacks until the Mutant goes down.

After the fight, the Mutant will apologize for attacking you and will
request that you destroy it. The Mutant doesn't think that he/she was
ever meant to be created, so hit the red switch to send him/her into
the lava. After a word of advice to Momo, the creature will die but
then you hear a curious pukueeee sound. Then a mini mutant will jump
out of the lava. Momo thinks this is the offspring of the Mutant so
she decides that you guys should take it along with you. After deciding
on a clever name, Peco, you get the option to change party members.
Leave Peco out of your party, and keep him there for a long time
because you'll have big plans for him much later in the game.

Once you're done with that, exit the Dump the way you came in and head
back to the Plant. When you arrive back at the Plant, talk to Palet
and you'll tell him that you took care of the problem. As you leave
he'll tell you that he knows a way to get to Wyndia, even though the
roads are blocked. So Palet lets you stay at the inn tonight for free
while he gets everything set up for you to go tomorrow. Now go to the
inn to the right and rest. In the morning Palet will have you hide in
a hay cart, and have the cart shipped to Wyndia. But when you get to
Eygnock Road, half the horse duo will be there checking baggage. You're
then found and carted off to the Arena again.

                        ------------------------
Items:
Coin, Bandana, 40z

When you arrive in Genmel, Balio and Sunder will have you tied up and
they march you into their office inside the Arena. After they give you
some grief and are deciding on what to do with you now, they happen to
mention the Contest of Champions. Then Nina tells Balio and Sunder that
you want to enter the contest, because the winner can have anything
they want, in this case it's freedom. At first the horse duo will be
opposed to the idea, but then the thought comes to them that they have
another chance to make money off you. Their logic is that people will
bet against a bunch of kids like you, thinking that you have no chance
to win. But Balio and Sunder have seen how strong you are and the
spectators haven't, so when you win, the house will get a lot of
income from lost bets. So they agree to let you fight in the contest,
and they'll even let you walk around on your own and leave the Arena
to level up if you need to. But they make you leave one hostage behind
(choose Peco), and they have their men blocking the roads so you can't
escape again.

So now you're free to explore the inside of the Arena. There's an inn
and some shops as well on one of the floors. Take time now to get
familiar with where all three fighting areas are, and make sure you
check the drawers in all the locker rooms to find a Coin, a Bandana,
and 40z.

Once you've familiarized yourself with the inside of the Arena, make
your way over to the Hall of Fire where your first match is. Go to the
Hall of Fire locker room area and enter the southern locker room. Talk
to the person inside to get a briefing on the rules of this fight, and
once you understand the rules, say that you're ready to fight (but
make sure you're rested up). After the introduction to the battle, get
ready to fight Patrio's team.

-------------------------
Boss fight: Patrio's team
-------------------------
HP: Claw- 250, Cawer- 250, Patrio- 300, Dodai- 2100
Exp- Claw- 150, Cawer- 165, Patrio- 200?, Dodai- 3000
Zenny/Item- Claw- 200 / N/A, Cawer- 70 / Dream Ring, Patrio- N/A /
Scale Mail?, Dodai- none / N/A
Recommended team- Ryu
Recommended level- 15 (but higher for option 2)
Notes- As you learned from the rules, there are two ways to win this
fight; by defeating all three of the team's members, or by taking out
the Dodai that holds your opponent's platform. But beating the Dodai
is no easy task, so if you're at level 15 or lower I suggest you stick
to option 1.

Option 1- Against your first opponent, Claw, just use normal attacks
and maybe Double Blow if you have it. Claw has some high agility and
will often use Blind, so equip the Bat Amulet for this fight. Once you
deal with Claw, your next opponent will be Cawer. Cawer will cast
assist magic on himself and then hit you with normal attacks and weak
magic spells which don't do much damage. Just repeat on him what you
did to Claw and he'll go down just as easily. Last but not least is
Patrio, and he's no pushover unlike his two teammates. His normal
attacks do a lot of damage, he'll often get a Lucky Strike on normal
attacks, and he sometimes uses Frost Strike which can put you to sleep.
To beat him, just transform into a Flame Dragon with genes of your
liking and nail him with Flame Claw until he goes down.

Option 2- It's a lot harder to pull off, but if you can take down the
Dodai, you'll earn a whopping 3000 Exp! You're going to have to be a
couple levels higher than 15 to do this conventionally, because you
need a lot of AP for your dragon form and a little extra power and
agility. At the very start of the battle (when you're against Claw),
transform into a Whelp right away using the Flame and Reverse genes so
you have access to Frost Claw. The Dodai is obviously resistant to
fire (he's standing in lava for crying out loud), but he is very weak
against ice. Nail him with Frost Claw for a few turns to get an idea
of how much damage it's doing on average. If Frost Claw is
consistently doing less than 100 HP of damage per hit, then I suggest
aborting option 2 and just do option 1. If Frost Claw consistently
does 150-200 HP of damage per hit, then keep it up. When the Dodai
sinks lower into the lava, it means he's almost at the end of his rope.
As you attack the other team's Dodai, they'll follow suit by attacking
yours. If your Dodai starts to sink lower into the lava, just use a
MultiVitamin on him. Deal out a couple more hits and the Dodai will go
down (But if you want the maximum amount of Exp, revert back into
normal form shortly after the Dodai sinks lower into the fire, then
beat Claw and Cawer, and then transform back into a dragon when you
fight Patrio and finish off the Dodai).

After winning the fight, and raising a few eyebrows, it's time to go
to your next match in the Null Magic Hall. Go to the inn and rest up,
and then walk over to the Null Magic Hall locker room area. Walk to
the lower locker room and talk to the person inside to get a briefing
of your next fight. After you know the rules, say you're ready to go
and then wait for the match to start. Right before the match is
scheduled to begin, your opponent, Emitai, will come into your locker
room to talk with you. He tells you his daughter is very sick, and if
he can't win the money needed for her operation, she'll die (basically
he's asking you to throw the fight). But you tell him that you're in a
jam too if you don't win, so he'll leave at that. But when you meet up
again on the battlefield, Emitai will have two huge, green monsters
with him. It looks like he means business now, get ready to duke it
out with Emitai and the Golems.

-------------------------
Boss fight: Emitai's team
-------------------------
HP: Emitai- 600, Golems- 750 each
Exp- 600 / Zenny- 340 / Item- Magician Rod (Emitai)
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Nina
Recommended level- 15
Notes- The rules say that you can't use magic, but they don't say
anything about dragons do they? Your dragon ability will give you the
unfair advantage in this fight, so use it. Since there's no magic in
this battle, there aren't any attacks you need to watch out for,
except maybe the Golems' Spirit Blast. Have Ryu transform using the
Flame, Defender, and Thorn genes. Ryu should pound at Emitai with Flame
Claw while Momo does the same with her bazooka, and Nina should use
Healing Herbs on the party when necessary. Once you've taken out
Emitai, the Golems will become disorientated and start attacking each
other. This will go on for the rest of the fight, so through your
laughter, have Ryu use Flame Breath and Momo should keep shooting away
with her gun just to hasten their demise.

After the fight, you'll all be feeling pretty down on yourselves for
beating Emitai. Sunder enters your locker room to congratulate you on
making it to the finals, but you're too depressed to appreciate this
right now, even from him. When Sunder returns to his office to tell
Balio what's going on, they both are sure that you're not going to win
the final match. Back in your locker room, you're reminded that you
have to get going to your final match in the Hall of Kings. You hear
that Emitai is still in his locker room so pay him a visit. It turns
out his daughter isn't sick, and he was just trying to con you into
losing the fight.

Now rest if you want, and then head over to the Hall of Kings locker
room. Once again, go to the southern locker room and talk with the
person inside to get a briefing of the fight. Meanwhile in the
adjacent room, Balio and Sunder are giving Garr, your opponent, a
little prep talk. They mention to him that Ryu's a dragon, and his
curiosity is suddenly aroused. After the introduction of both Ryu and
Garr, Garr requests that you not hold anything back during the fight.
This guy isn't fooling around. It's now time for the finale of the
tournament.

----------------
Boss fight: Garr
----------------
HP: Infinite
Exp- none / Zenny- none / Item- N/A
Recommended team- Ryu
Recommended level- Any
Notes- Although you can't win this battle, it's still fun to try. Garr
will sometimes use weak fire based attacks, but will for the most part
just hit you with physical attacks. After about seven turns, or after
Garr takes about 600 damage, he'll say "Let's Finish This". After this
happens, let's just say that you'll be dead in two turns at the most.
For this fight just turn into any dragon you want and have a blast.

After your defeat, Balio will come out to award Garr his prize of
anything he wants. Surprisingly, Garr chooses Ryu and his friends as
his prize. Balio is quick to disallow this, but Garr sees to it that
he gets his way. Once Ryu wakes up and you are done talking, head over
to Balio and Sunder's office to retrieve Peco. After you free the
hostage, Garr will tell you that everyone's free to leave. Once you
leave the office, talk with Garr and he'll tell you that if you want
to learn more about Ryu and the ancient Brood, then travel east to a
place called Angel Tower. First, though, you have to get back to
Wyndia so exit the Arena, rest up and save your game, and go north to
the Maekyss Gorge.

When you arrive at the gorge, cross the bridge to find, guess who?,
Balio and Sunder. It seems that they're defying Garr's wishes, and
they've blocked up all the roads so that you can't escape. They'll
then send out three thugs to challenge you. Quickly dispose of them by
using Nina's strongest spells. Afterwards, Balio and Sunder will
remind you that you're surrounded and there's no way out, but then out
of nowhere, Garr shows up (and he's just taken out all the thugs behind
you). He'll tell off Balio and Sunder and join your party. Realizing
that Garr has broken his alliance with them, the horse duo fuses into
one big horse who resembles a certain Japanese superhero. They're out
to get rid of you once and for all, so prepare to fight Balio and
Sunder's ultimate form!

--------------------
Boss fight: Stallion
--------------------
HP: 1500
Exp- 801 / Zenny- 500 / Item- Life Shard
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Garr
Recommended level- 16
Notes- This guy is undoubtedly the hardest boss yet. Aside from using
Barrier to cut down the amount of damage magic does to him drastically,
the Stallion will often cast Resist which negates all attacks for that
turn. The Stallion also can cast Jolt, but it does minimal damage. The
attack you really need to worry about is his Utmost Attack, which does
50+ damage to all party members. Before the battle, select attack
formation and put Garr at the point end so his physical attack will do
about 80-100 damage each turn. Have Momo cast Speed on Ryu and herself
and cast Protect on everyone; otherwise just have her use her normal
attack packing Ammo. Ryu should transform into a Dragon from the start
(Flame and Thorn), and hit the Stallion with Flame Claw. Just make sure
you have Momo keep everyone's HP near full at all times while Ryu and
Garr deal out damage, and you'll take Balio and Sunder down slowly but
surely.

Now that Balio and Sunder are finally out of your way, it's time to go
back to Wyndia, not only to return Nina to her home but to pick up
some passports for the eastern checkpoint also.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Frost)- But before you exit the Maekyss Gorge,
follow the path under the bridge to find a house. Check around the
house to find the Frost gene.

Once you've done that, exit the Maekyss Gorge and head north to Wyndia.
When you arrive in Wyndia (make sure Nina is in your party) hike all
the way up to the highest section of town where the castle entrance is
located. Have Nina talk to the guard at the door and he'll welcome you
in.

                          --------------------
                          Inside Wyndia Castle
                          --------------------
Items:
120z, Gems (2), Panacea (2), Healing Herb (2), Coin, Cheese

The next scene begins at a big banquet for Ryu, Nina, and the rest of
your party hosted by the king of Wyndia. Nina has just finished
explaining everything that's happened since the kidnapping to her
father. The king commends Ryu's bravery and apologizes for thinking he
was a con artist. And right before Nina spills the beans about Ryu
being a dragon, Garr will interrupt and ask the king for some
passports so you can get through the eastern checkpoint. He gladly
gets some passports made up for you, and Ryu and the rest of the party
will head off, leaving Nina behind at the castle.

Just when Nina is in her room thinking that it's for the best that she
didn't go along with Ryu and his crew, she hears something break along
with a scream. You'll have control of Nina now so check the dresser in
her room for 120z and then head downstairs. From here, walk left and
then up to the dining room with the blue carpeting. Pick up Gems X2 in
the drawers in this area and then speak to the lady standing next to
the broken dish. She'll tell you that something brushed up against her
and scared her. You can assume it was just a mouse until you spot Honey
running off somewhere. Now head left to the end of the dining room and
you see a guard. Go down the hallway to the guard's right to empty out
into a small room. Get the Panacea from the drawer in this room and
return to where the guard was standing. Now climb the stairs to the
guard's left to enter the king and queen's bedroom. Look in all the
drawers in this room and the room above it to obtain Healing Herb X2
and a Coin. After you pick up all the items here, head all the way
back to the base of the stairs of Nina's bedroom. Once you get there,
walk south to find a stair set going down. In this next room, walk
down the stairs in the bottom left corner of the room to reach the
kitchen. Now go down to the end of the kitchen and check the drawers
there for a Panacea.

Afterwards head down the stairs at this end of the room. You'll end up
in a room with a bunch of crates. Walk right and head down the small
wooden ramp. Use your camera angles to check behind the crates
directly below the wooden ramp to find a mouse. Talk to it and answer
yes to it's question to get Cheese. Go left from here and use your
camera angles to check around the end of the same line of crates that
the mouse was behind to find Honey. Talk to Honey and she'll run away
again, so go after her. Go all the way back to Nina's room and head
through the door inside of her room. Exit this next small room to the
left. You'll now be on the balcony and you spot Honey just ahead of
you. And while trying to keep Honey from falling off the balcony, Nina
will fall off too. But instead of falling to your death, Honey uses her
chrysm power to let you both float gently to the ground. After the
fall, Honey gets broken so Nina takes her to Ryu's camp just outside
Wyndia.

Back at camp, Momo has already noticed that Honey has gone missing.
Then Nina will arrive at your campsite with Honey in hand, so she and
Momo go inside the tent to fix her. Now that they're alone, Garr will
tell Ryu that if he travels to the eastern lands with him, then he
might die. Nina overhears this and get upset, because she doesn't want
Ryu to die. So Nina decides to run away from home again and travel with
Ryu to the eastern lands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                      III. Journey to Angel Tower

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're ready, head east from Wyndia on the main road and pass into
Eastern Wyndia. Keep going east to find the checkpoint. Once you enter
the checkpoint, Garr will point out the fact that you might have some
trouble getting through the passport check with Nina around. But after
some quick thinking, you get past the guards. And after an unnecessary
conversation on the bridge, you'll emerge in the Rhapala region (Also,
return to the checkpoint later to pick up the 200z and Antidote
inside).

                      ----------------------------
                      Exploring the Rhapala Region
                      ----------------------------

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Thunder)- One of the first things you'll probably
notice is the [?] hut that's northeast of the checkpoint bridge. Enter
that area to find an abandoned fisherman's house. Check inside the
house for a Life Shard and use your camera angles to search the area
behind the house to find the Thunder gene.

Back on the world map you'll find two new fishing spots, a place called
Mt. Zublo to the far southeast, and the port town of Rhapala along the
central coast. Also since you now have everywhere from the Yraall
Region to the Rhapala Region open to you, go back to some places that
you've already been to and look for masters and missed items. Now's a
better time than ever to sign each of your party members up under a
master, because at this point, there are many different masters to
apprentice under.

                        ------------------------
                        The Port Town of Rhapala
                        ------------------------
Items:
Molotov, Panacea

When you first visit Rhapala, you'll see the same state of peacefulness
and rhythm as you witnessed in Wyndia. Rhapala is the home of the
porter's guild, so almost everyone you see in town is either a sailor
or a fisherman. Take the time now to explore the town and the Wharf
and to get the Molotov and Panacea that lie in town. Also if you have
the money, visit the shops here to upgrade your weapons and stock up
your item inventory.

                            Knight's Helm- 720z

Once you're done exploring town, go to the porter's guild building
near the inoculation shop and talk to the guy behind the counter to
see about getting a ride on the boat. He tells you to go talk to the
guild master, Sinkar. So head over to the inn and you'll find Sinkar
in the pub below the inn (he has a reddish orange beard). Sinkar tells
you to speak with his daughter, Shadis, about the boat. So walk down
to the Wharf and find Shadis (she's the blonde girl in the pirate
getup). Talk to her, and you'll witness a big sailor named Zig beat up
on a nerdy guy named Beyd. Afterwards, Beyd will talk to you about the
boat. He tells you that the boat is not here right now so he can't give
you passage on it.

If you want some more information on porter's guild and other things,
talk to Beyd again. Once you're done here, head back to town. Before
you exit the Wharf, you'll run into Shadis. She apologizes about what
happened before and tells you to speak with Sinkar about using the
road instead of the boat. So walk back to the pub and talk to Sinkar
again. He tells you that because of a recent volcanic eruption, the
road around Mt. Zublo is impassible. It looks like you're stuck here
until the boat returns to Rhapala, so exit to the world map and you'll
automatically set up camp.

While your party is thinking about how to get east without a boat, out
of nowhere, Nina starts talking soap opera about Shadis and Beyd. She
thinks that they both like each other, but Beyd is too shy to tell
Shadis how he feels. So she decides to talk to Beyd about it. You're
not going anywhere without a boat anyway, so why not go with Nina's
idea.

After you break camp, go to the Wharf with Nina in your party and have
her talk to Beyd. Once you've relocated yourselves, Nina tells Beyd
that he should propose, but Beyd claims that he shouldn't because he's
not a big strong sailor like Zig. Nina then offers to train Beyd so
that he can be strong too, but he refuses and walks away.

After you regain control again, head back over to where Beyd, Shadis,
and Zig usually are and talk to Beyd. As you've probably already heard,
the lighthouse here at Rhapala is broken and full of monsters. Zig has
decided to try to fix the lighthouse and win Shadis over. Beyd then
reconsiders your offer to train him, and he gives you 1000z to buy him
a weapon and a suit of armor. He tells you not to get him anything too
heavy, but ignore him and buy the most powerful weapon and the most
defensive armor you can afford with indifference to weight (if you
just want to give him equipment from your inventory and not spend any
money at all, that's fine too). Once you have his equipment, head back
to the Wharf and talk to him again. And when you're ready, begin his
training.

                              -------------
                              Training Beyd
                              -------------

At the first training session you have with Beyd, the first thing you
should do is equip him with the stuff you picked out for him. You can
change his equipment if you want to before you start each training
session. Once he's equipped with a weapon and a suit of armor, talk to
him and begin the training. The training is set up just like a normal
battle with your three party members against Beyd. Each training
session will end after 20 turns in battle, if Beyd's HP reaches zero,
or if your party is wiped out. To begin another session, just go to the
Wharf the next day and talk to him. There are three of Beyd's
attributes that can increase during his training; HP, defense, and
attack power. You can see how much these stats rise after each session.
His stats rise depending on these factors:

HP- The more damage (in HP) he takes total, the more it will rise
Def- The more hits he takes while defending, the more it will rise
Atk- The more damage (total) he inflicts on your party, the more it
will rise

I'd suggest working on his attack power and HP the first few sessions
and then concentrate on his defense for one or two sessions afterwards.
While raising his HP, put Ryu, Momo, and Garr in your party. Have Ryu
or Momo cast Protect on Beyd once or twice (because he's really weak at
the start) and then have everybody attack him with normal attacks until
he gets low on health. Then have Ryu or Momo heal him to full (or near
full) HP and then start attacking again. Attack and heal Beyd as needed
until the session is over. If his HP rises significantly that session,
then do the same thing next time but don't cast Protect on him.

To raise his attack power, put Ryu, Momo, and Nina in your party. Have
Nina cast Weaken on all of your party members and, if she's at level 20
or higher, have Momo cast Might on Beyd. While he's hacking away at
you, work on raising is HP by attacking him and healing Beyd and your
own party. To raise his defense, put Ryu, Momo, and Garr in your party.
Attack Beyd and bring his HP gauge down to about a fifth of it's
maximum. When Beyd's HP gets about this low, he'll start to defend.
Attack him while he's defending and heal him when his HP is about to
reach zero, then do it over again. The Backhand skill can be especially
useful for raising Beyd's defense.

When you think you've trained Beyd enough, talk to him at the Wharf
and tell him to go to the lighthouse. Zig will overhear you and he
challenges Beyd to a fight to decide who will fix the lighthouse.
Everyone will then go to the town square to watch the fight. It's
supposed to be a one on one battle between Zig and Beyd, but when Zig
turns his head away and waves, you can help Beyd out by healing him or
attacking Zig (but if you trained Beyd well enough, he won't need your
help). If you get caught helping Beyd, the fight will be called off,
and if Beyd looses, train him a little more and try fighting Zig again.


Once Beyd defeats Zig, head back to the Wharf and talk to Beyd. He's
pretty banged up after the fight, and he isn't going to fix the
lighthouse anytime soon, so he gives you the Guild Badge. The badge
shows that you're an associate of the porter's guild, and it'll give
you access to the lighthouse. But before you go to the lighthouse, buy
one or two extra pieces of Flame Chrysm and pick up the items in the
two chests near where Beyd is (What's inside them depends on the
equipment he had when he beat Zig. One of them will be the next most
powerful weapon, and the other will be the next most defensive armor).
When you're ready, head over to the western end to the Wharf to reach
the lighthouse.

                             --------------
                             The Lighthouse
                             --------------
Items:
Coin, Mithrl Shield, Swallow Eye, Skill Ink, Dream Ring,
Flame Chrysm (3), Faerie Tiara

Enemies:
Blood Bat, Bomber, Ghost, Spectre, Thunder, Volt

When you first enter the lighthouse, walk off the wooden bridge and go
up the stair set just ahead. Head right from the top of the stairs to
find some barrels blocking your path. Have Momo use her gun to blow up
the barrels and then go up the stairs north of you. Head left from
there and climb up another set of stairs. Walk right to find a chest
containing a Coin. Now return to the area where you had Momo shoot away
the barrels and head right and down the next set of stairs. Walk left
on the narrow path just to the left of the base of the stairs to get a
Mithrl Shield. Return to the base of the stairs and head down to a
wooden bridge. Cross the bridge to reach a concrete island. Head south
from here and cross the next bridge and the bridge after that. Climb up
the stairs north of the bridge and check behind the ledge left of the
barrels to get a Swallow Eye. Now climb up the ladder to the right and
go up the small stair set north of the ladder. Then head left from
there all the way to the end of the path to find a door leading inside.

Once you get inside, go down the stairs to the right and head southwest
to a path going left. Follow this path all the way to the end (ignoring
the stairs going downward) to get a Skill Ink. Now go down the stairs
you ignored before and then head left to a blue switch. Hit the switch
and continue down the path to a doorway; head inside.

Read the directions on the wall to the right to get a description of
what to do here. First, examine the machine to the right of the ladder
and put a piece of Flame Chrysm inside of it. Then head over to where
the switch in this room is and examine it. You'll then hear a sound
like a machine starting up, and a green wave grid will appear on your
screen. An arch will start to bounce about the screen, bouncing off
the top first and then the bottom. You'll notice that the arch bounces
in a pattern; once every four times that it first hits the top of the
screen, the arch will hit a mark in the upper middle portion of the
grid. In order to stabilize the valve pressure, you need to hit the
switch exactly when the arch hits that mark (and it isn't as easy as
it sounds). Watch the pattern of the arch a couple of times and then
develop a counting rhythm to the arch's first hits against the top of
the grid. When you've got a good rhythm down, hit the X button just an
instant before it hit's the mark and you will have done it. Try to do
it in one try, because you have to sacrifice a piece of Flame Chrysm
for each time you try it. If you run out of Flame Chrysm, then read
ahead.

Once you've opened up the main valve, climb down the ladder on the
left and follow the line coming out of the machine (which should be
lit up now) out of this room. Follow the lit line to the right and
check (using camera angles) near where the line shoots directly upward
to find a Dream Ring. Now head through the southern doorway to end up
in a small area outside with three chests. They each contain a Flame
Chrysm, so if you haven't opened the main valve yet, go back and try
again (if you run out of Flame Chrysm again, you have to go all the
way back to town and buy some more; you can't complete this mission
without opening the main valve). Now head back inside and go up the
stairs to the right and hit the blue switch to avert the flow of
chrysm energy in the line. Continue up this path and go up the stairs.

You should now be near the bottom of the first set of stairs you came
down when you first arrived inside the lighthouse. Now take the large
northwestern path up and to the left to come across a strange looking
lizard creature. You assume that it's harmless so continue up to path
until a big omni-optical boulder comes crashing down the stairs (this
will happen only if the line leading up the stairs is lit up. If it's
not lit, go back to the first blue switch you came across, the one
before the main valve room, and hit it). The big mass will then land
on the shoulders of the lizard creature and it'll come to life. It's
time to fight the Gazer.

-----------------
Boss fight: Gazer
-----------------
HP: 1200
Exp- 1500 / Zenny- 1000 / Item- N/A
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Garr
Recommended level- 17
Notes- This fight's not too tough, but if you don't beat Gazer quickly,
you might be in for a small challenge. Gazer's normal attack hits all
of your party members for a good amount of damage, and it's Eye Beam
attack can do 50+ damage to a single character. It'll also cast
Hypnotize occasionally to confuse your party. Have Ryu use Accession
right away with the Flame and Thorn genes and pound away with Flame
Claw, which does phenomenally in this fight (the flame property also
negates the Eye Beam attack). Momo should cast Protect on the entire
party and restore anyone who falls under confusion (via Panacea or
Remedy) or has low HP throughout the entire battle. And have Garr
stick to his regular attacks and the Gazer should be KO'd in no time.

After you're done with Gazer, continue up the path and climb up all the
stair sets to reach the top of the lighthouse. When you get to the top,
hit the switch there to light the bulb of the lighthouse. Once you do
this, a faerie will arrive at the scene and attempt to turn off the
light again. When it fails, the faerie will get mad at you and it
gives you the Faerie Tiara which lets you use the flower rings
scattered about the world to teleport to their world. The faerie gives
you this so that you can make up for turning on the lighthouse.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Eldritch)- So after that's over, grab the Eldritch
gene sitting behind the lighthouse bulb and leave the lighthouse. Then
rest, save, and head over to the nearest flower ring and enter the
world of the faeries.

                      ----------------------------
                      The Fight for Faerie Village
                      ----------------------------

Once you enter the faerie village, follow the path up, and then head
inside the hut. Talk to the faeries inside and they'll tell you that
there's been some monster threatening them to turn off the lighthouse,
so you agree to help kill it for them. After you're done talking, exit
the hut and go down the left path to the beach and wait for nightfall.
After a while, you'll spot a pink fin in the water, moving toward the
beach. When it gets near the shoreline, your party unleashes a huge
attack on it. But when the smoke clears, you'll find that you've just
attacked a pink, talking dolphin. While your other two party members
go to consult the faeries, the dolphin will start cussing out Ryu in
Australian. It turns out that the dolphin's mad because the light from
the lighthouse gets in his eyes while he's trying to sleep. And when
the others get back, the dolphin will go postal and attempt to kill
you.

-------------------
Boss fight: Dolphin
-------------------
HP: 1200
Exp- 900 / Zenny- 200 / Item- Fish Head
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Nina
Recommended level- 17
Notes- The Dolphin is pretty easy if you use the right attacks. The
only attack you need to worry about is Tsunami, which halves all of
your party member's HP (Note- You can learn Tsunami as a skill). Have
Ryu cast Shield on the party and then use Accession with the Thunder
and Eldritch genes. Then have him beat away with either Thunder Claw
or Myollnir if you can spare the AP. Nina should use Lightning and
Momo should stick to healing and using her normal attack when she can.

Once the battle's over, return to the hut, and the faeries will thank
you for helping them. They also show their gratitude by letting you
rest here for free, so rest up and then leave the faerie village.

When you get back to the world map, go the Wharf at Rhapala and talk
to Beyd (he'll be in his usual spot). Beyd tells you that even though
the lighthouse is fixed, the boat still won't arrive at Rhapala for a
while. He then suggests that you speak with Sinkar about using the
road again, so head over to the pub and talk to him. Sinkar reminds
you that the road is blocked, but because you fixed the lighthouse, he
gives you a letter that grants you access to a shortcut that cuts
through Mt. Zublo. So stock up on Healing Herbs, Vitamins, and
Panaceas, give you party members each a flame inoculation (Because Mt.
Zublo's a volcano, so expect to face fire based enemies), and save
your game. Once you're ready, enter Mt. Zublo.

                                ---------
                                Mt. Zublo
                                ---------
Items:
Protein, Asbestos Armor, 800z, Ring of Fire, Flame Talons,
Wisdom Fruit, Life Shard

Enemies:
Lava Man, Lizard, Lizard Man, Vulcan

First, follow the path to the right of the stairs to find a chest with
a Protein inside. Now climb up the stairs and go right past the guards.
Make another right and take the multiple stair sets along this path up
to the shortcut entrance in the side of the mountain.

Now that you're inside the volcano, there are a few terrain features
that you should be aware of. The first are the patches of molten lava
on the ground in most areas of the volcano. If you step on the lava,
your lead character will take damage (in HP) for each step you take
(but your HP will never get below 1). In most situations, you can
navigate around the lava and still get where you need to go. But in
order to obtain some valuable items, you'll have to walk over patches
of lava and take damage. Just make sure you heal yourself with items
afterward, so you don't enter a random battle with low HP. The other
hazards in the volcano are the white and yellow geysers that shoot out
of the ground and the walls. White geysers just do a small amount of
damage to whoever gets hit by them, but yellow geysers induce
confusion, which is not much fun to deal with outside of battle because
it reverses your d-pad controls. Immediately cure the confusion with a
Panacea.

Continuing along, follow the first path up and to the right. Then
continue to the right, past the big lava patch and a pair of geysers,
and head upwards to a cavern on the left. Go inside and pick up the
Asbestos Armor in the chest and exit the way you came in. Follow the
path north from here, past the lava patch, to get a chest with 800z
inside. Now return back down to where the cavern was and head south to
a path that leads to passageway; enter it. In this next area, walk past
the pair of geysers on the ground and follow the upper ledge on the
right going southeast (make sure to time your passes between the yellow
geysers that shoot out of the walls along this path). Slide down the
ramp along this path to end up on an outside corner of the wall between
two yellow geysers. Continue to the right and head down the path just
to the right of a small stair set. Slide down the ramp (avoiding the
yellow geysers as best as you can, but you're probably going to get
hit), to reach a small ledge and a chest containing the Ring of Fire.
Equip it to someone and then jump off the ledge (also make sure to cure
any confused party members). Now, make your way back up by climbing the
small yellow ladders to the left. Climb the ladders and cross the small
lava patch to reach the small stair set you saw before. Go up it and
exit this area through the cavern at the right.

Follow the path in this next area to the right and then downward. Keep
going down this path, around the lower section where the dragon gene
is, and then southeastwards to reach a junction.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Miracle)- Take the northeastern path all the way
around until it slopes downward. Walk down and around the lava, hugging
the left ledge, to obtain the Miracle gene.

If you're bold enough, walk through the big lava patch southeast of
there to get the Flame Talons in the chest (make sure you heal
immediately afterwards). Now, return all the way back to the main path
where the junction was and head southeastward. At the next junction, go
down the southwestern path to pick up a Wisdom Fruit, and then return
to that junction (heal your party) and head up the northeastern path.
As you come across a narrow path between two pools of lava, you'll be
halted by a drooling old man who starts babbling something about the
tower. He'll then summon two monsters, Scylla and Charybdis, to kill
you. Prepare yourself for a huge fight!

---------------------------------------
Boss fight: Gisshan, Scylla, and Charyb
---------------------------------------
HP: Gisshan- 800, Scylla/Charyb- 1000 each
Exp- 1500 / Zenny- 1000 / Item- N/A
Recommended team- Ryu, Momo, Garr
Recommended level- 19
Notes- This is a pretty challenging fight, but if you come well
prepared then you'll take control of the battle. Both Scylla and
Charyb will sometimes use Wall of Fire (a moderate flame attack) and
Snap, but they will most often hit you with their normal attack.
Gisshan will either be defending or annoying you by casting Sleep on
your party (so equip the Dream Ring) and Vitalize on himself and his
cronies. If you haven't rested since your flame inoculations, then you
already have complete resistance to their fire based attacks. Even if
she's had a shot, have Momo equip the Ring of Fire so that she'll
absorb flame attacks as HP, and also equip her with Ice Chrysm. Have
Ryu cast Shield on the party and then transform using the Frost and
Eldritch genes. Once again, just have Garr use his normal attack.
First, focus all of your attacks on Gisshan, and have Momo heal when
necessary. After Gisshan dies, have Ryu pound away at the two serpents
with Blizzard until his AP gets low (then use Frost Breath). Garr
should keep laying into them with his physical attack, and Momo should
attack with her Ice Chrysm and keep healing when needed.

With another victory under your belt, continue up the path and through
the cavern at the end. Now head down this next short path to the exit,
but first, use your camera angles to spot a chest containing a Life
Shard near the end of the path.

                             ----------------
                             The Urkan Region
                             ----------------

At this point in the game, the Urkan Region only has a few points of
interest. The Urkan Tapa is a little ways east of Mt. Zublo, and Angel
Tower is to the southeast of the Urkan Tapa. There's a fishing spot to
the south near Mt. Zublo, and Junk Town lies to the far northeast. If
you have a good amount of zenny in your pocket (about 15000-25000),
then consider going to Junk Town and view the weapon selection in the
shop there. The weapons are mighty expensive, but when you see how
powerful they are, you'll know why. Once you're done exploring this
new region, head over to the Urkan Tapa.

                             --------------
                             The Urkan Tapa
                             --------------

You'll quickly find out that the Urkan Tapa is a very religious place,
and it is also home to the guardians. Take some time to explore the
confusing layout of the village, upgrade your weapons and armor, and
stock up your item inventory.

Urkan Tapa Item Shop           Urkan Tapa Weapon Shop

Baby Frog- 50z
Popper- 50z
Float- 50z

While exploring the southeastern part of town, you should come across
a building with a large boulder blocking the entranceway. The village
elder, Sudama, is meditating inside, so put Garr in your party and
have him push the rock aside. Go inside the room, and Garr will talk
to the elder about something that you probably won't understand yet
(unless you've played the game before). Sudama will then tell you to go
to Angel Tower, so exit the Urkan Tapa, and you'll automatically set up
camp. While camping, Garr will begin to tell Ryu why he said that he
might die, but then he tells you never mind. Once you've broken camp,
save your game and enter Angel Tower.

                               -----------
                               Angel Tower
                               -----------
Items:
Ivory Dice, Wisdom Seed, Diamond Ring, Moon Tears, Mithril Helm,
Soul Gem, Napalm

Enemies:
Cerebus, Lizard Man, Phantom, Spectre, Tricker

First, head up the long set of stairs until you come across a break in
the railing to the right. Walk through that gap in the railing and jump
off the ledge above the chest to reach that chest (it contains Ivory
Dice). Jump off that ledge too and then go through another break in the
railing to the right. Jump off this next ledge at the outside corner to
get a Wisdom Seed from the chest, then jump from that ledge also. Now
walk left, following the canal, to reach the beginning again. Climb
back up the stairs and go through the break in the railing again.
Jettison off the ledge where the Urkan guy is standing and off the
next three ledges as well. Then head up the long narrow stair set to
the right and go through the doorway.

When inside, go down the only set of stairs in this small room. In this
next area, continue to the bottom of the stairs and then head left to
what looks like a dead end. Have Momo blast away the cracked section
of the wall with her gun to reveal an opening. Go through the opening,
head down the stairs to the left, and then exit through the next
doorway. In this room, head right to pick up a Diamond Ring and some
Moon Tears (equip the Diamond Ring to someone because there is an enemy
in this place that uses death attacks).

Now return all the way back to the bottom of the first long stair set
that you came down when you first got inside, and head right. Go around
the small inward-jutting wall, and climb down the next set of stairs
that you see. At the bottom of those stairs, go up the small stair set
immediately to the right, continue up that path, and then exit through
the doorway at the end. In this room, you'll see two inclined breaks in
the upper section of the room, and a large green block at the east end
of the room. In order to get the chest in the upper section of the
room, you must have Garr push the green block into the first inclined
break going from right to left. If you don't understand these
directions, then refer to this crude diagram:

 upper section                              chest
====================\ /============\ /=============
====================| |============| |=============
 lower section                      ^-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<- [green block]

Once you've done this, exit the way you came in , go back down the
small stair set at the end of this hall, and go back up the stairs to
the left. From the top of these stairs, head right and go through the
doorway at the end of the path. You'll now be in the upper section of
the room you were in before, and you can now access the chest
containing a Mithril Helm at the east end of the room. Again, exit the
way you came, return to the bottom section of this room, and continue
through the doorway at the right end of the room (directly below where
the Mithril Helm was). Follow this next hall northwest, and then go
through the doorway near the end of the room. Head left from here,
grab the Soul Gem, and then exit this room. Now climb down the stairs
directly south of you.

In this next area, head down the next stair set you see (to the
southwest), and use your camera angles to find a chest containing
Napalm near the stairs. Now, continue down the path, past the small
stair set on the right to reach a big green block (similar to the one
you saw before). Have Garr push it straight against the ledge to the
far right and then up two spaces. Return to where you first entered
this room and go right. Follow this path to a stair set going down.
Head down those stairs to reach another block. Have Garr push it to
the left three times and then position yourself north of it to push it
southwards all the way it can go (to get north of the block, you'll
have to switch your lead character to Ryu, because Garr's too big to
get between it and the ledge). Once you've done that, get back to the
east of the block and continue down the path, hugging the rightmost
wall. Walk to the left and take the upper left path to get behind
another green block. Push it up twelve times so that it forms a bridge
with the block you pushed before.

Now, as you can probably see, you've formed a path to the stairs going
down at the east end of the room. Use the path you've made to reach the
stairs, and then climb down them. When you get to the basement, Garr
will ask your other party member to leave so that he and Ryu can go on
by themselves. Now, walk over to the tower in the middle of the room
and examine the plaques that rest on each side. Each plaque will have
a guardian's name and a number below it. Take a deep breath and examine
the plaque on the far side to find Garr's name on it. As Garr will tell
you, it turns out that he fought in the dragon war hundreds of years
ago, and the number below his name is the number of dragons he killed.
The basement of Angel Tower serves as a graveyard for the ancient
Brood, and Garr has brought you here to kill you because you're the
last of the Brood. Some friend he turned out to be. So get ready for
round two against Garr.

----------------
Boss fight: Garr
----------------
HP: 300
Exp- 400 / Zenny- none / Item- Scale Mail
Recommended team- Ryu
Recommended level- Any
Notes- This fight is an exact opposite to the first time you fought
Garr. Just transform into any dragon you want that has Frost Claw and
nail him with it. You can also use the Miracle gene by itself and
batter Garr with your normal attack. You'll be slower than Garr, but
who needs speed when you have 500+ HP and your opponent is only doing
20 damage to you.

Once you make short work out of Garr, he'll ask you why you won't
finish him off just before some chaos will erupt. The tower will seem
like it's falling apart and the Behemoth Kaiser will come down upon
Garr. As Ryu is walking through the darkness, the same Brood warrior,
who beckoned him in the dream he had at the beginning of the game,
calls to him again. Ryu will then have a seizure, and the scene will
fade out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                              IV. Revenge

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

About ten years after the incident at Angel Tower, Garr is hired to
get rid of a dragon that appeared in Dauna Mine. Garr finds the Whelp
dragon and gives it a good whack with his spear. As the dragon reverts
back into it's human form, a familiar blue-haired young man appears.
It turns out that the dragon is Ryu, and he's grown-up now. Garr
explains that he's been searching for you for many years, and he asks
you to forgive him (although your answer will have no baring on the
game). He'll then give you your equipment, and after Ryu changes into
some clothes, you'll have control. Follow Garr by heading down and
around the path and exiting at the right (this area should be familiar
from the very beginning of the game). When you meet up with Garr again,
he'll tell you his doubts about the righteousness of the war he fought
in 400 years ago, and he asks you to journey with him to see his god.
Your first concern, though, is getting out of the mine, so once you're
done talking, continue on.

                               ----------
                               Dauna Mine
                               ----------
Items:
Vitamin, Life Shard, Magic Shard, Light Clothing, 200z, MultiVitamin,
Coupons, Feather Sword, Lion's Belt, Protein

Enemies:
Fire Slug, Ghoul, Giant Roach, Slug, Zombie, Zombie Dr.

From here, head right all the way to the end of the room and then exit
to reach the area with the big green skull. Walk to the leftmost end
of this area and climb the stairs there to get to a platform with three
chests on it (they contain a Vitamin, Life Shard, and Magic Shard).
Now walk back to the eastern end of the room and take a path going
downwards all the way to an elevator. Examine the panel and take the
elevator up to B1, and as you ascend, you'll be followed by a dark,
ghost-like mass.

Follow the wooden path right from the B1 elevator, and then go down the
wooden ramp. Head left on the mining cart tracks to get the Light
Clothing in the chest. Now go back to the wooden ramp and walk to the
right on the tracks to exit this area. Follow the tracks through the
next two areas to get outside. Head inside the nearby hut and pick up
the 200z inside the drawer, and stock up on healing items (especially
Panacea) from the fish merchant. After you're done here, return all the
way back to the elevator and go to B2. If you walk through the doorway
near the B2 elevator, you'll find a room where you can rest and save
your game, so use this room as often as you need to. From the elevator,
head to the right, past the save room, to reach a small slope going
downward. Go northeast from there (don't go down the slope yet) all the
way to a doorway at the end of a short hall. Head inside and get the
MultiVitamin in the chest, and then exit the way you came.
***Note- When you get Momo back in your party, return to that room and
have her blast away the weak section of wall with her gun to reveal a
room with the valuable accessory, Coupons, inside***.

Return to the small slope back in the other area and go down it to find
a mining cart full of explosives on a track. Throughout this area,
you'll find switches that change the direction of the track. Walk past
the mining cart and hit the first switch you come across along the
track. Then follow the track northeast and hit the switch on the right
side of the track. Now have Garr push the cart full of explosives, and
it should end up forming a small bridge that lets you get to the chest
containing a Feather Sword on the ledge. Grab the Feather Sword and
then have Garr push the cart back to where it was when you first found
it.

Then hit the switch to the south of the Feather Sword chest again (the
2nd switch you hit). From that switch, head upwards and hit the switch
directly northwest of it. After that's done, push the cart, and it
should end up stopping at the left end of the northernmost track. Push
it from that location, and the cart should collide with and shatter
the big boulder that was blocking the passageway out. But before you
can leave, the same dark, disembodied mass that was stalking you
before will appear and take shape in the form of the Dragon Zombie.
The zombie inquires Ryu about why he is allied with a guardian. And
when you refuse to kill Garr, it'll try to kill both of you.

-------------------------
Boss fight: Dragon Zombie
-------------------------
HP: 2500
Exp- 1000 / Zenny- 300 / Item- Power Food
Recommended team- Ryu, Garr
Recommended level- 21
Notes- You're going to want to beat the Dragon Zombie as quickly as
you can, because this guy is a nuisance fighter. It's Rotten Breath
attack is almost sure to poison both your party members every time,
and it's worst attack is Bone Dance, which damages and confuses all
targets. But if you have a good supply a Panaceas and Antidotes, you
can quickly restore your normal status by having Ryu and Garr heal
each other. Have Ryu use Shield once, if you want to, and then have
him transform using the Flame and Eldritch genes. Then use the Restore
spell on the Dragon Zombie to do over 500 damage with each casting.
When Ryu's AP gets down to about a third of it's maximum, stop using
Restore and start using Flame Claw. Have Garr stick to his normal
attacks, as well as curing status changes using items.

**NEW DRAGON GENES (Shadow and Fusion)- After you've defeated the
Dragon Zombie, a true member of the Brood will come and vanquish it
for good. As the evil spirit dissipates, it will release the Shadow
gene, and the true Brood spirit will grant you the Fusion gene. Once
this is done, exit this area through the cave that you just unblocked.

In this next area, follow the tracks up to a junction and head
southeast. Take this path all the way to the end and go up the small
wooden stair set to exit this area through the doorway on the right.
Next, follow the wooden path down and go throught the first doorway
you see. Take the next path up and go northwest at the junction to get
a Lion's Belt. Return to the junction and head northeast to pick up a
Protein, and then exit this room the way you came in. Continue down
the wooden path and exit this room through the passageway at the end.
Then follow the next wooden path southeast and go through the doorway
at the end. Hit the switch inside this room three times and then exit
to find the metal bridge raised. Cross over the bridge and leave the
inside of the mine.

When you get outside, one of the workers will confront Garr and ask
him if he got rid of the dragon. Once you're done talking to the chief,
head southeast to the area where the two houses are. Enter the leftmost
house to talk to the boss and get your reward. Before you leave, the
boss tells you about some monster that's been attacking people near
the road. Now use the house to the right to save your game and then
leave Dauna Mine. You'll automatically make camp, and Ryu will have a
reminiscent dream. He wakes up and then goes outside to talk to Garr.
Garr will tell Ryu that they must head east to Angel Tower again and
then you'll break camp.

                    --------------------------------
                    Exploring the Dauna Hills Region
                    --------------------------------

Dauna Hills is a very small region compared to other places that you've
been to, but there's still a lot to see here. You'll find fishing spots
to the south and to the west of Dauna Mine. A little ways southeast of
the mine you'll find a [?] hut with a familiar bunch of faces inside.
To the south lies Ogre Road, and Syn City is to the southwest. Also,
there's at least one flower ring in this area, so check up on the
faeries and you can begin building your faerie village (find out more
about the faerie village under side quests). When you're done looking
around, head over to Syn City.

                                --------
                                Syn City
                                --------

This place is the headquarters of the blackmarket and the gang that
Balio and Sunder worked for and is populated by the same kind of
crooks and lowlifes that you saw in Genmel. Take time to check out the
shops here, as well as talk to the people in town. The bum sitting near
one of the shops will give you information about the blackmarket and
the monster at Ogre Road for a small price.

When you're done exploring Syn City, go back to the world map and head
south to Ogre Road.

                                ---------
                                Ogre Road
                                ---------
Items:
Hourglass, Horseradish (3)

Enemies:
Goo Titan, Tricker, Slasher, Vagabond

First, walk down the path to a small incline going downwards. Go down
the incline and continue to follow the path around the ledge with the
chest on it until you reach a junction. Head northwest a little ways
from the junction and have Ryu cut down the strange looking plants to
obtain Horseradish. Then go southwest to an incline going up. Head up
it and follow the path all the way around to reach the chest containing
an Hourglass that you saw on the ledge. Now go back a little ways and
jump off the ledge to the right of where the Horseradish was. Now walk
southeast all the way to the end of the road, where you'll be stopped
by the Weretiger, the monster that's been attacking people on this
road. Just hit it with your normal attacks, and after taking a couple
hundred HP's of damage, the Weretiger will flee the battle. Then
continue downward and exit Ogre Road. The south exit of the road will
empty you out into western Yraall Region. There's really isn't anything
else here besides a new fishing spot and Mt. Levett, so continue onward
to Mt. Levett.

                               ----------
                               Mt. Levett
                               ----------
Items:
800z, Gold Hairpin

Enemies:
Blue Goblin, Boss Goblin, Goo Titan, Slasher, Tricker

Once you enter Mt. Levett, head right and then northeast up a long,
steep slope. Go left from the top of the slope and then to the
southwest to reach two sliding inclines (like the one you saw at Mt.
Glaus except smaller). Slide down the left one to pick up 800z in the
satchel and then slide down the next incline. Enter the cave to the
right, and follow the path inside up to the exit. Exit the cave and
walk right, past the top of the steep slope you went up before, and
take the lower path. When you get to the middle of the path, you'll
fall through a hole in the ground and into a cave. Pick up the Gold
Hairpin in the chest near you and head southwest to exit the cave.
Jump off the ledge outside and hike back up the steep slope. Once
you're at the top again, walk northwest a small ways and follow the
upper path going right. Take this path right and then downwards all
the way to the exit.

When you get back on the world map, go to the [?] hut north of Mt.
Levett. Pick up a Healing Herb in one of the drawers inside, and then
continue east. Head across the bridge that was out at the beginning of
the game and enter Yraall Road.

                       ----------------------------
                       Reunion in the Yraall Region
                       ----------------------------

When you enter Yraall Road, head up the path to find Wyndian guards
blocking the road. Talk to them and they'll tell you that there's a
crime investigation going on, that's why the road is closed. Garr then
suggests that you go see what's going on at McNeil village. So enter
McNeil and talk to the innkeeper (she's standing right in front of the
inn). You'll then go inside the inn and talk about the tiger you saw on
Ogre Road. It turns out that the tiger was last seen going into Cedar
Woods, and Garr offers to help get rid of it. The innkeeper lets you
stay the night for free, so rest at the inn and then go to Cedar Woods
***CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD***.

Enter Cedar Woods and then walk over to the place where your destroyed
house is. When you arrive at that area, you have a flashback of when
Balio and Sunder came to kill you. Go up to the path leading to your
house and Garr will tell you to go on alone. Continue along the path
and up to your house to find the tiger. It's Rei! He'll recognize Ryu
right away, and he is amazed about how strong you've become. Rei is
relieved to see that you're alive, but Teepo is still nowhere to be
found. Ever since you were separated, Rei's been hunting down the
people Balio and Sunder worked for, and he's been using his power to
attack people on Ogre Road. But before you can tell him that you've
already killed Balio and Sunder, he tells you that he won't stop until
he avenges you and Teepo, and then he runs off. So now, meet up with
Garr again and head down to McNeil village.

When you get there, you'll see that Rei got revenge on Loki. After
talking to a few of the villagers, go to the farm, and from there, go
to McNeil manor. Once you're done talking with Garr, you'll witness
Nina arresting Mr. McNeil, and after a little confusion, she'll ask
you what's going on. The three of you then go to the cow pasture and
explain everything that's happened since the separation at Angel Tower.
Nina agrees to the idea of Ryu learning more about the Brood, but she
insists that finishing the investigation should come first. Nina
suggests that you all go to Syn City to finish the investigation, so
exit back to the world map and return to Syn City.

                              ------------
                              The Massacre
                              ------------
Items:
Old Painting, Healing Herb, 80z, Deluxe Rod

When you arrive at Syn City, the smell of blood is in the air, so you
know immediately that's something's wrong. Walk around town and talk
to all the wounded people. It's obvious that Rei came here looking for
the boss of the blackmarket. Head over to the other side of the city
(which was inaccessible before) and go inside the cave there. Speak
with the people inside, and you'll find out that the boss fled from
Syn City up to the northwest Checkpoint. So pick up the Old Painting
in the chest and leave Syn City. Rest and save your game, and then
head over to the Checkpoint to the northwest. You'll arrive at the
Checkpoint just in time to see that Rei has hunted down the blackmarket
leader, Mikba. After a few cross words, Rei will give Mikba a good
slash with his knife, and then your party will show up. But while
you're conversing with Rei, Mikba will transform into his fighting
form, and he knocks Rei senseless with one blow. He'll then recognize
Ryu as the one who killed Balio and Sunder, so he decides to take you
out as well. It's time to fight Mikba!

-----------------
Boss fight: Mikba
-----------------
HP: 2500
Exp- 3000 / Zenny- 1500 / Item- N/A
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Garr
Recommended level- 21
Notes- Mikba is no pushover, so don't take him lightly. Aside from
using Venom Breath to poison all of your party members, Mikba also has
a ridiculously high reprisal rate, and he gets Lucky Strikes very
often. The battle will start with Ryu and your third party member at
normal health, but Rei will be unconscious. If you choose to revive
Rei during the battle, do so carefully because he'll immediately
transform into the Weretiger. You will have no control over Rei when
he is in this form, and he will also slowly become berserk, which
means he might attack his own allies. If you have the Influence skill
(learned from Boss Goblins), you can bait Mikba, and this will cause
Rei to become berserk much more slowly (or not even become berserk at
all). Anyway, have Ryu cast Shield once or twice and then turn into a
dragon using the Flame and Eldritch genes, then bash away with Flame
Claw. Garr should concentrate on keeping everyone healthy by using
Antidoes and Vitamins. Keep everybody's HP near max at all times,
because Mikba can attack you several times in one round via reprisals.
Once you do about 1000 or so damage, revive Rei and bring him up to
full HP (and bait Mikba if you have Influence). The Weretiger will be
a huge help if he keeps attacking Mikba and not your own party members.
Then continue to have Ryu attack and heal, and have Garr keep healing
too, and you'll bring Mikba down.

After the battle, Mikba will say his last words and then die. You'll
then tell Rei all about what's happened since the incident in Cedar
Woods. Then Rei decides to end his reign of vengence and join Ryu on
his journey to see god. Once you're all done talking, choose three
party members (put Rei in your party) and go inside the hut near you.
Pick up a Healing Herb and 80z in the drawers, and then have Rei pick
the lock on the locked door to get the Deluxe Rod. Now exit the
Checkpoint.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                       V. Problems at the Plant

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the Dauna Hills Region, head east all the way back to Eygnock Road
(the main road that's just south of Wyndia), and enter it. As you're
walking along, Nina will get an idea. She suggests that Ryu should help
investigate and solve the troubles that the Plant has been having
lately, so that the king will make new passports for him (apparently
the king blames Ryu for Nina's running away all those years ago). Now
exit Eygnock Road and head over to the Plant.

                          --------------------
                          Reunion at the Plant
                          --------------------

When you get to the Plant, familiarize yourself with the area
(especially the conveyor belts), and then head over to where the
furnace is. There you'll find Momo working on a machine, and with a
little help from Honey, she'll pull away from her work to talk to you.
You all will then go to the inn to talk about everything that's
happened since Angel Tower. Momo tells you that the Plant director,
Palet, has gone missing, and that the Plant is in turmoil because of
it. Since Palet is the only one who can fix this mess, you decide to
go and look for him. But first, you need to go pick up Peco, so exit
the Plant and enter the Yggdrasil tree's grove just east of the Plant.
When you get there, you'll find Peco hanging out in front of the
Yggdrasil tree. Collect him, change party members (make sure Peco's in
your party), and then go back to the plant.

You'll get the strange feeling that something's wrong when you return
to the Plant. Speak with everyone here to find out that things have
gone from bad to worse, and Palet still hasn't returned. Now, head up
the usual path of conveyor belts (the way you would go to get to the
furnace area) to reach two different areas overlooking two greenhouses
filled with chrysm gas. You'll probably also notice several stones on
the ground, as well as an X on the ground at each spot. Have Peco kick
a rock onto the X, and then after a good running start, have him kick
the rock off the ledge. If you hit the rock with enough speed, it
should jettison off the ledge and break the glass panel in the
greenhouse's roof, releasing the chrysm gas. If you mess up, then
simply kick another rock onto the X and try again. Do the same thing
with the other greenhouse (it doesn't matter which one you do first).

Once you've cleared out the gas in both greenhouses, you'll hear a
rumbling sound, and then the furnace smoke stacks will start releasing
green chrysm gas. So now, go down the next conveyor belt to the
furnace building and head inside. Inspect the hatch along the wall to
see that it's weak enough for Momo to blast it off with her gun. Have
Momo shoot the hatch off, and then walk through the opening (this
would be a good time to switch Peco out of your party in exchange for
someone more desirable). You'll end up in a very small room with a
ladder going down it's center, so climb down it to reach the
underground laboratory.

                       --------------------------
                       The Underground Laboratory
                       --------------------------
Items:
Skill Ink, Ammonia, Silver Mail, Sleep Shells, Wisdom Ring,
Healing Herb, 400z

Enemies:
Big Bulb, Fly Man, Giant Roach, Toxic Fly, Zombie Dr.

After getting over the amazement of finding this place, walk left to
reach a door with #1 on it. Examine it, and you'll find that it's
locked electronically. Go back and head southeast from the first
ladder you came down to find another ladder going up. Climb that
ladder and check behind the haystacks in this room to find a satchel
containing Skill Ink. Now, go back down the ladder, walk northeast up
the hall, and enter the next room. In this room you'll find several
computer terminals, and because you will return to this room frequently
during the mission, let's call this the "main room". Have Momo examine
the computer with the number 1 on the screen. She figures out that
these terminals control the electronic locks on the numbered doors in
the laboratory, and that you need to input the correct password to
unlock the doors. Momo guesses the correct password and unlocks the #1
doors. Exit this room the way you came and go through the #1 door that
was locked before. In this room you'll find three doors numbered 1, 2,
3 from left to right, and since you'll be coming back to this room a
lot also, let's call this the "3 doors room". Now head through the #1
door.

From here, go right and down the stairs. Pick up the Ammonia from the
drawer, and then go down the stairs in the southwest corner of the
room. This room is flooded with chrysm radiation so you can't stay in
here for very long. Run over to the north corner of the room and use
your camera angles to spot the Peco-like creature. Inspect it to get a
hint for a password, and then return to the main room. Have Momo
examine the computer with the number 2 on the screen, and she'll enter
the password. The password is correct, so all the #2 doors open. Return
to the 3 doors room and go throught the #1 door again. Head down the
stairs to the right and inspect the #2 computer in this area to unlock
the #2 door next to it. Check behind the boxes in this room for a
Silver Mail, go back to the 3 doors room, and exit through the #2 door.

Walk along this next path a little ways and enter the next #2 door you
see. Follow this narrow area up to a switch; hit it and exit the way
you came in. Continue up the path and to the left, past the #3 computer
terminal, and down the stairs at the end of the path. From here, head
right and follow this path all the way around until you reach a ramp
leading up to an AC vent and a doorway to the right. Enter the doorway
at the right and head northeast a small ways. Examine the piece of
paper on the floor behind the AC vent to obtain the password for the
#3 doors.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Force)- Now, go up the ramp and onto the AC vent.
Follow the vent up into the next area, and then keep following it up
to reach the Force gene.

Return to the room where you found the #3 password, take the conveyor
belt to the southeast up, and exit this room to the right. In this next
area, grab the Sleep Shells in the chest behind the box, and then hop
on the conveyor belt going right. Go back to the main room and input
the password to the #3 computer to unlock the #3 doors. After you've
done that, walk over to the 3 doors room and head through the #3 door.
Go up and to the right past the three flashing panels on the ground.
Then walk northwest to see chrysm gas leaking out of a #3 door. Head
inside to find some strange creature mutating and getting larger right
before your eyes. It's time to fight!

---------------------
Boss fight: Huge Slug
---------------------
HP: 2500
Exp- 2100 / Zenny- 300 / Item- Vitamins
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 22
Notes- The Huge Slug isn't too hard if you use the right attacks. The
only attack you need to watch out for is Syphon, which steals your HP.
This guy also has a protective coating that makes him immune to your
physical attacks. The coating can be destroyed if you hit the Slug with
a flame attack. So, have Ryu cast Shield and then transform using the
Force and Flame genes. Momo should cast a few assist spells such as
Might and Speed, heal when necessary, and attack packing Flame Chrysm.
If you've learned Flame Strike from the Fly Men here, give it to Rei
and have him pound away with it (otherwise use Weretiger). Just have
Ryu use Flame Claw the entire battle, unless you can spare the AP for
a few Auras, and the Slug should go down without much trouble.

Once you've dealt with the Huge Slug, exit this room the way you came
in and climb up the stairs to the left. Inspect the yellow book on the
ground near the flashing panels to get a hint for the last password.
The flashing panels on the ground in this room each have a chrysm
pressure reading. The password is the chrysm pressure units' numbers
(1-5) arranged in order from least to greatest chrysm pressure. You can
easily figure out the password yourself, but you don't really have to
considering the #4 computer gives you a short list of numbers to choose
from (you can just go down the list until you select the correct one).
But if you're bent on figuring it out yourself, then I'll just tell
you that one of the unit's reading is incorrect, and you have to look
around the lab for a clue. Anyway, head right from there and pick up
the Wisdom Ring from the chest on the AC vent.

Now, once again, return to the main room, and have Momo examine the #4
computer terminal. Like I mentioned before, a list of number
arrangements will come up. Choose "other" to bring up a second list.
From that list, select the third set of numbers from the top. The #4
doors will now be unlocked, so go through the door behind all the
computers to arrive in a rest/save room. Rest up, save your game,
snatch the Healing Herb from the drawer, and exit this room through
the door on the right. Head up this next narrow hallway and climb up
the ladder at the end. Enter the next room through the #4 door at the
top of the ladder. In this area, walk right and then up the ramp onto
the AC vent. Follow the vent northeast all the way to the end, go
right, and then descend down the ladder there. In here you'll finally
find the man you've been searching for, Palet. It turns out that, long
ago, Palet and Momo's father worked in this lab together, trying to
concoct an elixir that would bring the dead back to life. Momo's father
quit the experiment, but Palet has still been trying to revive his
mother ever since. In order to protect his mother from you, Palet
drinks an extract from the Yggdrasil tree and transforms into a huge,
mushroom-like creature. It's time to take on Palet.

------------------
Boss fight: Shroom
------------------
HP: 3000
Exp- 3900 / Zenny- 300 / Item- Wisdom Fruit
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 23
Notes- Shroom is probably the toughest boss yet, so if you defeat him
easily, you know you're doing well so far. For this fight your going
to want to cast Shield at least 3 times, because Shroom's attack power
is very high. He also has an attack that damages your whole party, and
he can use Restore to heal himself for a good amount of HP. After Ryu
is done casting Shield a few times, have him ascend into a Warrior
dragon (I prefer the Force, Defender, and Eldritch genes for this
fight, but any combo resulting in a Warrior will do fine) and hit
Shroom with Aura for however many turns you as can afford to (also use
Focus to increase your power if you have it as a dragon). Momo should
back up the party by casting Speed and Might on both Ryu and Rei, and
by healing when you need to. Have Rei use Pilfer so you can get your
hands on that valuable Wisdom Fruit. After you've stolen the Wisdom
Fruit, have Rei stick to using his normal attacks. Don't use Weretiger
unless it's absolutely necessary. For some reason, Rei goes berserk
very quickly in this battle, so if you feel that you really need to
use Weretiger, don't use it until the very end of the battle.

After you've defeated Shroom, pick up the 400z in the drawer and hit
the switch to turn off the machine so Palet's mother can finally rest
in peace. Then exit the underground laboratory and leave the Plant,
and you'll automatically make camp. While camping, Momo will converse
with Nina, and in a nutshell, Momo decides to come with Ryu to the
eastern lands. Once you break camp, head over to Wyndia.

                         ----------------------
                         The Escape from Wyndia
                         ----------------------
Items:
Laurel

When you enter Wyndia, Nina will request that Ryu stay behind while
she and Rei go to the castle to get the passports (The logic is that
the king thinks that Ryu kidnapped Nina all those years ago, and he'd
probably recognize Ryu and his friends if they came to the castle. But
he's never seen Rei before, so the king won't know that he's Ryu's
friend). Before you head to the castle, walk over to the fountain near
the inoculation shop to find four familiar people. Remember when you
played Hide and Seek with those kids in Wyndia all those years ago?
Well, they're still here and still playing Hide and Seek, but they've
tweaked this children's game a bit (to find out more, see the Masters
and Side Quests sections). Now go to the castle, have Nina talk to the
guard there, and he'll let you in to see the king.

At the hearing, Nina explains everything about the blackmarket and the
Plant, also saying that she wouldn't have been able to do it without
Rei's help. The king commends Rei's actions and agrees to immediately
make a passport for him. While the passport is being made, Nina offers
to give Rei a tour of the castle. Once you regain control, head right
and then southeast from the corner. Then go down the stairs at the end
of the path. After Nina tells Rei a little about this area, it's
dejavue as Honey comes running up to the two of you. Collect Honey and
then go over to the dungeon. Pick up a Vitamin from the drawer at the
beginning, and then have Rei pick the lock on the cell door to access
the chest containing a Laurel. Now, exit the dungeon and go to Nina's
parents' bedroom (it's up the stairs to the left of the dining room in
case you forgot). Have Nina talk to her mother, and then exit this room
the way you came.

When you reach the bottom of the stairs your passport will be done.
After you receive it, Nina suggests to Rei that he takes his leave
quickly before Ryu is found. But before you can leave, a castle guard
alerts the royal family that Rei was seen talking to Ryu in town. Nina
tries to explain that Ryu isn't a criminal, but then her mother comes
into the picture. And when Rei tries to give his opinion about these
family matters, the queen really gets ticked, and the chase begins.
You dash for the front exit but it's blocked by guards. Then Honey will
start running away, so Nina says to follow her just like she did years
ago. Once you follow Honey down the first set of stairs, continue
through this room and into the kitchen. Run through the kitchen and
down the next set of stairs into the cellar. Make your way through
this room and then climb down the ladder at the end, just as Honey
does. When you get to the bottom of the ladder, you'll witness Honey
trying to break down a door that Rei simply picks the lock to. Honey
will go inside, but it looks like the queen and her men have caught up
with you. The two of you go inside the next room to find that Honey
has activated the alter in here. As Honey shows you, this alter is a
transporter so you climb on and vanish from the castle.

When you reappear, get off the transporter and climb up the ladder to
find that you've been transported to Durandal's hut on the outskirts
of Wyndia. Exit the hut, return to the world map, and you'll
automatically make camp. You'll then talk with the rest of the group
and then rest. You have your passports, but you can't go anywhere near
Wyndia for awhile , so it's time to head east.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           VI. Freeing Deis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you break camp, head east from Wyndia to the Checkpoint. Enter the
Checkpoint and show the guards your passport, and then pass over into
the Rhapala region. As you can see, nothing much has changed in this
region over the years, except that the main road around Mt. Zublo is
now open. So take the road around Mt. Zublo to the Urkan region, put
Garr in your party, and then go to Angel Tower.

When you get there, put Garr in the lead position and walk up to the
bottom of the big stair set between the two guards. When they see Garr,
the guards will ask him about his long sleep. As you climb to the top
of the tower, Garr will tell you about how guardians go into a stone
sleep when their purpose in life is complete. And after Garr prays
before the alter at the tower's peak, the immodestly dressed Deis will
appear. She explains to Garr that she's imprisoned here at the tower,
and the key to her freedom lies in guardian Gaist (one of the guardians
who fought alongside Garr in the war). Once Deis vanishes, Garr
suggests that you all go to the Urkan Tapa to inquire about Gaist's
whereabouts. So head over to the Urkan Tapa and talk to the elder,
Sudama. He tells you that Gaist lives out somewhere to the west. Now
exit the Tapa, go west along the southern coastline, and pass back
into the Rhapala region to the south of Mt. Zublo. From there enter the
Tidal Caves.

                               -----------
                               Tidal Caves
                               -----------
Items:
Fish-head, Coin, Thunder Ring, Hawk's Ring, Deadly Blade

Enemies:
Barb Bulb, Bomb Seed, Slasher, Sleepy, Spiker

As you'll soon learn from the fish guy sitting near the entrance to the
caves, the water level around here changes every few minutes. Walk past
the fish guy and you'll see the water level drop. Now, enter the cave
at the end of the path. Follow this next path northwest and enter the
cave on the right. Take this path up to a junction, head northeast
around the corner, and use your camera angles to spot a chest
containing a Fish-head. Return to the fork in the path and walk left
to reach another fork. Head southwest from there and follow that path
down to a passageway; go through it. Pick up the Coin in the chest,
exit the way you came, and go back to the fork in the path. Walk
northwest and follow this path around to another junction. Go right
and then exit through the passageway at the end.

From here, go right over to a small wooden dock with a ladder going
down it. If that ladder is underwater, go back inside the cave and
walk around until the water level drops. Once the water level is down,
climb down that ladder and head right to a narrow path going
southeastwards. Get the Thunder Ring in the chest at the end of the
path, and then return to the ladder you came down before. Climb down
the ladder directly under it and go inside the cave to the right.
Follow the path inside left, and continue to the left at the first
junction. Head northwest at the fork after that and follow this mossy
path over to a skeleton holding a Hawk's Ring.

Now exit this entire cavern the way you came in. Hop on the raft the
the southeast of the cave entrance, and it'll float to the left. When
the raft stops, get back on it and ride it again, but this time it'll
float to the southeast. After you get off the raft, walk northeast and
head through the passageway on the right. Now, go right and then up
the slope to a chest containing a Deadly Blade. Return inside, ride
the raft again, and it'll float northwest back to the other small dock.
Get off the raft and exit this area through the southwesternmost
passageway. In this next area, climb up the ladder to the left, and
then head right from the top of the ladder to exit the cave.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Gross)- Now walk left, pick up the Gross gene
sitting on the side of the path, and then exit the Tidal Caves. Once
you're back on the world map, head west a little ways to reach Cliff.

                                  -----
                                  Cliff
                                  -----
Items:
Beast Spear

This is a small community composed of outcasts, outsiders, and other
people that just can't fit in anywhere else. Explore the village and
talk to the people here to find out that Gaist is living here. So put
Garr in your party and enter the cave-house at the far northwest end
of the village. When you go inside you'll find Gaist. He and Garr will
start to talk about to talk about their doubts of the past and the
present, and Garr will also tell Gaist about Deis. After a little
while, Gaist will want to speak with Ryu alone, so Garr and your other
party member will leave. It turns out that Gaist wants to know just how
serious Ryu is about learning about his people and journeying to see
god. He asks that you go outside and speak with Garr before giving him
an answer, so exit his house and talk to Garr. When the choice comes up
answer "I must know the truth". Now, rest and save if you haven't done
so since you went through the Tidal Caves, stock up on items at the
local shop, and then go back in and talk to Gaist. Tell him that "I
want the truth", and he'll request that you stand between the two
torches in the room. Once your in the right spot, Gaist will transform
and challenge you to a fight.

-----------------
Boss fight: Gaist
-----------------
HP: 2500
Exp- 1000 / Zenny- 500 / Item- Beast Spear (check ashes at end of fight)
Recommended team- Ryu
Recommended level- 25
Notes- Gaist may look mean, but he's not as tough as he looks. His
normal attack does a moderate amount of damage, and he occasionally
uses Risky Blow and Howling. The only other spell you need to be aware
of is Sanctuary, which erases the effects of all assist magic. With
that in mind, don't waste time and AP casting assist spells, and
immediately transform using the Force, Frost and Eldritch genes. First
take out the two torches because they heal Gaist each turn with Flare
(they have about 300 HP each). Once the torches are gone, attack Gaist
with either Aura or Frost Claw, and he'll go down pretty quickly.

After the fight, Garr and your other party member will come in to
witness Gaist's last moments. Gaist explains that it had to be this
way in order for Deis to be released. He then dies and turns to dust.
Now that this is done, Deis should be free so it's time to go back to
Angel Tower.

***NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT- Before you leave Gaist's house, inspect his
remains to get the Beast Spear, Garr's ultimate weapon***

                             --------------
                             Help From Deis
                             --------------

Once you get back to Angel Tower, ascend the main staircase and go
through the break in the railing to the right. Jettison off the ledge
right next to the narrow stair set that leads inside the tower, and
then jump off the next three ledges as well. From there head southeast
to a staircase going down. Descend it to find Deis, and she'll be
released. After she beats the crap out of Garr for letting her be
cooped up in the tower like that and talks with you for a bit (there's
also a flashback from the dragon war), Deis will tell you meet up with
her at the volcano to the west (she means Mt. Zublo). Once she takes
off, exit Angel Tower, and enter Mt. Zublo via the main road.

Remember that cave along Mt. Zublo's main road, the one that the
guards are standing near? Go inside it and have Ryu examine the wall
at the end of the path. You'll then be transported to the place where
Deis resides. She'll come out, with clothes on this time, and explain
that she can't use her power to it's full extent in the nude. Say "I
like you this way" and you'll get a happy response from Deis. Then Garr
will appear and ask Deis about finding god. It turns out that she can't
take you to see god herself, but she can give you something that will
guide you there. Deis will then cast a spell on Ryu, giving him the
Eye of God. The Eye will act as a compass that points in the direction
of the guardians' god's residence. It then shines and points to the
north. So, it looks like you're going to have to cross the sea to find
god. After you're done talking with Deis, you'll be transported back to
the shrine at Mt. Zublo. You'll be needing a boat to get across the
ocean, so exit the mountain and head over to Rhapala.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         VII. To Cross the Sea

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you arrive at Rhapala, talk to the people here to find out that
the ship is broken again. Go down to the Wharf and you'll find Zig,
Shadis, and Shadis's new baby. Speak to Shadis and she tells you that
Beyd went to Junk Town to investigate the problem with the boat. So,
leave Rhapala, head back to the Urkan region, and go to Junk Town (it's
northeast of the Urkan Tapa).

Items:
Green Apple, MultiVitamin, Tea Cup

This town is home to the machine guild, which works together with the
porter's guild to transport machines. As you can see, the massive piles
of machine parts and other junk give this place it's name. Take time to
explore the town by talking to the locals and finding the items here; a
Green Apple, MultiVitamin, and Tea Cup. Also, check out the shops here
for some powerful weapon upgrades.

When you're done exploring, head over to the southwest corner of town
to find Beyd talking to a guildsman about the boat. After he leaves,
follow him and you'll exit back onto the world map. You can now fully
explore the Urkan region.

                        -------------------------
                        The Northern Urkan Region
                        -------------------------

This part of the Urkan region is a long narrow peninsula that creates
a boarder between the Outer Sea and the Middle Sea. The Dock is south
of Junk Town, and Steel Beach is just to the north.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (???)- As you head west along the peninsula, you'll
pass a fishing spot, and then you'll find a [?] hut and another fishing
spot at the end of it. Go inside the hut, pick up the Swallow Eye from
the drawer, and check behind the curtain for the ??? gene. Now, return
to the world map and go to the Dock.

                             ---------------
                             Fixing the Ship
                             ---------------

Once you get to the Dock, head southwest to find Beyd talking with the
mechanic who's trying to fix the ship. It turns out that the engine's
busted, and they don't have the right parts to fix it. When you regain
control, talk to Beyd with Momo in the lead position and she'll offer
to help fix the boat. Beyd will then take you down to the engine room
so Momo can see what's wrong. After inspecting the engine, Momo gives
you a list of parts that are needed to fix the boat. You're going to
have to ask around for a good place to look for parts. So get off the
boat and a guildsman will tell you that you should probably get
permission from the guild master before you go looking for parts. Talk
to the people hanging around the dock to find out that Steel Beach is
the best place to find parts. But since you need the guild's permission
to access the beach, return to Junk Town and speak to the guild master
(he's standing inside one of the houses and wearing a headband). Since
the ship will get fixed faster the faster the parts are found, the
chief gives you permission to look for parts at Steel Beach. So leave
Junk Town and go to Steel Beach.

When you get there, follow the wooden path up, and after you've dealt
with the guard, exit this cave onto the beach. Head northwest from
there to reach the entrance of an old freighter. Try to go inside and
the guard there will stop you, saying that you need to prove that
you're strong enough to go in because there are monsters inside. He
suggests that you speak to the foreman, so head right over to where
the little monkey guy holding the flags is standing. Talk to the big
guy near him with Garr in the lead, and you'll play the rope pulling
mini-game. Listen closely to the foreman's instructions, and remember
that the white flag is for the foreman, and the red flag is for Garr.
The key to doing this right is to be about a one meter ahead of the
foreman, because he doesn't adjust his speed according to the
differences in your rope lengths. If you're a meter ahead and you get
an extra turn, pull the rope more slowly. Once you've pulled the thing
in close to 6 meters the game will be over. But now a new problem has
arisen. It turns out that you weren't pulling a machine but a
gargantuan fish. Get ready to battle the Angler.

------------------
Boss fight: Angler
------------------
HP: 3000
Exp- 3000 / Zenny- 200 / Item- Fish-head
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Garr
Recommended level- 26
Notes- The Angler's not too hard. Aside from Venom Breath, the only
spell you have to worry about is Thunder Clap, an electric attack which
hits a single character for a good amount of damage. To counter this,
have a good supply of Antidotes and equip either Rei or Garr with the
Thunder Ring. Start the battle by having Ryu cast Shield, and then have
him use Accession with the Force, Frost, and Eldritch genes. Garr
should use his normal attack and Gambit (if you're feeling lucky), and
he should be equipped with the Beast Spear. Have Rei cast Speed on
himself if he doesn't already have an extra turn, and then use
Weretiger. Since the Angler has a weakness for ice attacks, Ryu should
pound away with either Frost Claw or Aura (whichever does more damage)
until the big fish dies.

Once you've defeated the Angler, the foreman will give you permission
to look for parts in the freighter. But before you go inside the
freighter to look for parts, collect the parts that are lying around
on the beach.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Mutant)- Pick up the Mutant gene sitting at the
northeast end of the beach. Now, here are the locations of the parts
on the beach:

-In the water just north of where the foreman is standing
-Behind the southern wall southeast of where the foreman is standing
-In the small junk pile south of where the foreman is standing
-Behind the ledge southeast of the freighter's entrance
-Hidden on the right side of the freighter near the guy using the
 blowtorch

After you find all of the parts on the beach, go inside the freighter
to find the remaining parts. When you get inside, first, take this
path northwest and check behind the short railing to the left at the
end to find a part. From there, keep heading northwest until you find
an "H" shaped part on the ground. Pick it up and head back southeast.
Go down the stairs to the right, and then climb down the two ladders
below it. Then walk left on this narrow path and climb down the next
ladder to reach the lower level of the freighter. Head right and hit
the blue switch there two times. Now, pass under the beam you just
raised and pick up the part to the right. Head left from there to find
another blue switch. Pick up the part to its left and the part hidden
behind it, and then hit that switch two times.

Return to the last ladder that you came down, climb back up it, and
head right. Walk across the first beam and pick up the part on top of
the crate. Go down the tiny ramp and then northwest across the next
beam. Make your way across the beam after that and collect the part on
top of the crate. Now, go back to the lower level of the freighter.
From the bottom of the ladder, walk northwest to a third and final
blue switch; hit it two times. Pass under the beam and check around
for the part hidden behind it. Head northwest a little ways and pick up
the part hidden behind the crates on the left. Then, check around the
crates to the right to find another part and a chest containing a Robe
of Wind. Now, once again, climb back up the ladder you took to get down
here. Head right and walk across the three beams again to get to the
last part. Once you obtain the final part, exit Steel Beach and head
back over to the Dock.

When you get there, go down to the engine room of the boat and give
Momo all of the parts. Very shortly afterward Momo will have the boat
fixed. It'll then shove off and head for Rhapala. When you regain
control of Ryu, go and talk to all of your party members on the boat.
When you talk to Nina on the outside deck, you'll spot something
strange in the distance. Meanwhile on the bridge, Beyd speaks to the
sailors about the mysterious Black Ship. When you arrive at Rhapala,
Beyd will give you full use of the boat. And before he can even assign
a sailor to drive it for you, Zig steps in and takes the job quite
eagerly. Zig goes up to the bridge to await your orders, so when you're
ready, talk to him and tell him that you're ready. You'll then leave
Rhapala.

Zig will ask you where you want to go once you're out at sea. When you
tell him you want to cross the Outer Sea, he'll ask you to talk it over
with the rest of your group first. So speak with all of your party
members, and then talk to Zig again, telling him that you still want to
cross the ocean. You'll then be transferred to the world map where
you'll have full control over the boat.

Boat controls:
Up (d-pad)- move forward
Down (d-pad)- move backwards
Left (d-pad)- turn left
Right (d-pad)- turn right
O button- speed burst/dash (engine overheats if you dash too long)

Once you get the hang of piloting the boat, head north and cross into
the darker colored water. As you try to cross the ocean, the enormous
waves hammer your little ship, and you're forced to turn back. When
you get back to calmer waters, speak to Zig and he'll tell you that he
can't get you across the sea in this boat. He then mentions a sailor
named the Legendary Mariner. Unfortunately, Zig doesn't know too much
about him. But he does know of someone who can tell you all about the
Legendary Mariner; the mayor of Parch. Parch is the town just north of
Rhapala, and it can only be accessed by boat. So once you regain
control, head over to Parch.

You'll soon discover that Parch is a more primitive town than others
that you've been to. Their staple product is fish which the people here
use as their main source of food and for trade. Talk to the people
around here and find a Coin and 400z inside the houses. Also check out
the shops here for some weapon and armor upgrades (but I would
recommend saving your money because the next town you visit will have
even better equipment, and it won't be cheap).

Head over to the northeast end of town to find the mayor's house. Talk
to him and he'll snap at you. It turns out that the mayor is in a
really bad mood because all there is to eat around here is fish, and he
hates it. And until this bad morale blows over, the mayor's not going
to tell you anything. But he does say something about the Maekyss
Gorge, and since this is your only clue of what to do now, go there.
Go inside the house near the bridge and talk to the lady inside. You
tell her your problem and she suggests you try feeding the mayor shisu
to get him to like fish. She'll tell you, in general, how to make the
shisu and where to find the ingredients for it. She then asks you to
collect all the ingredients before she explains, in detail, how to make
it. So grab the 400z from the drawer in this house, and then go find
the ingredients.

                               -----------
                               Shisu Quest
                               -----------

The shisu you're going to make is composed of four ingredients, and
this is how and where to find them:

Mackerel- A fish that can be caught at the fishing spot right next to
the Maekyss Gorge. They're not hard to catch, and any worm-like bait
will do just fine for catching them. You only need one.

Shally Seed- A rice-like seed that can be found in the tree just behind
the shisu lady's house at the Maekyss Gorge. Have Peco kick the tree
to make the seeds fall out. Get about twenty.

Vinegar- A sour liquid that can be obtained from the well at the Coffee
Shop. To get it, though, you must successfully play one of the most
annoying mini-games in the game. Put Garr in your party and have him
talk to the little cloaked guy standing next to the well. Listen very
closely to his instructions, and remember to hit the X button fast
enough (that's the most common mistake in this game). You might want
to get two helpings of Vinegar just to be safe (in other words, play
the mini-game twice).

Horseradish- A spicy plant found on Ogre Road. Just cut down the bush
with Ryu's sword to obtain it. I'd get about ten of these.

After you've obtained all of these ingredients, go back the Maekyss
Gorge and speak to the shisu lady. She'll give you a more detailed
explanation of how to make the shisu, and she also gives you her
recipe. I'd suggest looking at the recipe as a compound porportion:

10 mackerel - 8 shally seed - 2 vinegar - 4 horseradish

When you're ready, return to Parch and talk to the mayor's advisor to
begin making the shisu. First, select the mackerel and then make your
shally seed ball the same size as the mackerel slice. Then add the
vinegar in a 1-4 ratio with the shally seed. Add the horseradish in an
amount that's either twice as much as the vinegar or half as much as
the shally seed, whichever's more. When adding the vinegar and
horseradish, keep in mind that you'll loose one shally seed when you
knead the shisu. Finally, knead the shisu one or two times and hit end.
If you managed to make some substantial shisu, the mayor will love it
and be in a good enough mood to talk to you. But if he doesn't like it,
you obviously made a mistake, so try again.

Now that the mayor is happy, he gives you the Sea Charts which will
allow you to navigate the tidal area to the east. The Legendary Mariner
lives somewhere in that area. Before you leave, talk to the mayor's
advisor and he'll give you a prize depening on how well you prepared
the mayor's shisu. I don't have a list of all the prizes you can get,
but I know that the worst prize is an Ammonia and the best prize is a
Shaman's Ring. When you're done here, exit Parch and head over to the
[?] area to the east (it is between the rocks along the line between
the inner and outer seas).

Because of the tides in this area, you only have twenty-five seconds to
get where you need to go. So make sure your ship driving skills are
sharp. I'd also recommend that you dash in short bursts to prevent your
engine from overheating. And remember that you can only navigate the
light colored water. There are three chests in this area containing a
Heavy Dagger, Blizzard Mail, and Ice Shield. To get to the Legendary
Mariner's house, first, dash to the left and hurry up this channel.
Head left again, around the rocks, and then dash to the southwest to
reach the hut.

When you get there, the Legendary Mariner will invite you inside. You
tell him about your mission to cross the ocean, and he explains that
it's impossible for a Middle Sea boat to make the trip. He also tells
you that he's not really a great sailor, and he came from the other
side of the sea as a cast away. But seeing that you're determined to
cross the sea, Kukuys tells you about the Black Ship. The Black Ship is
a huge ocean transport that came from the other side of the sea. It
looks like the only way to cross the ocean is to somehow get aboard the
Black Ship.

You'll then leave the Legendary Mariner's house and be back in the
Middle Sea alongside the Black Ship (Note- Go back to Kukuys's house
later to get a Protein from the drawer inside). Momo will shoot at the
ship with her bazooka to get it to stop, but that plan fails and the
Black Ship retaliates with it's powerful turret gun. After the blast,
go talk to your party members. When you speak to Momo, she'll get
another idea of how to stop the Black Ship; ram it from behind. Take
this idea up to Zig and he'll OK it. You'll then be brought to the
world map, and the Black Ship will be patroling the area. If you have
any unfinished buissiness, take care of it now. When you're ready, use
the dash button to ram the Black Ship from behind. If you do it right,
you'll hit the Black Ship with a huge crash. After regaining control,
go check on all of your party members to make sure they're alright.
Now that you've stopped the Black Ship, you need to find it's bridge
so you can program it to head back across the ocean. Choose three party
members (be sure to include Momo), go onto the outer deck, and come
aboard the Black Ship.

                             --------------
                             The Black Ship
                             --------------
Items:
Skill Ink (2), Protectors, Ascension, Wisdom Fruit, Light Bangle,
Flash Shells, 2400z, Ammonia, Ivory Dice, Soul Gem

Enemies:
Bolt, Bolt Archer, Bolt Lord, Bolt Mage, Giant Crab, King Toad, Sleepy

First, head left and go inside through the door. Once you're inside,
head down the stairs next to the door ahead of you (FYI- The inside of
the Black Ship is home to the game's most rarely encountered enemy, the
Bolt Lord). Take this next path northwest and enter the next room
through the doorway at the end. From here, walk to the right and
examine the panel at the end of the path (also take note of the
brownish-yellow platfom on the left side of the path). Choose the P3
program, and then get on the platform. Ride it three times and then
head through the passageway to the right. Examine the panel in this
room and turn the crane main switch on. Now return to the previous
room and get back on the platform. Ride it twice to get back to where
you started. Select the P4 program from the panel and get back on the
platform. Ride the platform three times, pick up the Skill Ink in the
chest to the right, and then get back on the platform. After riding it
once, get off the platform and enter the door to the northeast. Follow
this path up to a small panel. Inspect it to find an Id Card.

Exit this room the way you came, get back on the platform, and ride it
twice to return to the beginning. Now go all the way back to the very
first room and head through the doorway next to the stairs to reach
the crane room.

Examine the panel in this room and operate the crane with the guide to
learn how the crane works. The crane is similar to that of a prize
grabber machine whereas the first time you hold down X the crane will
go right, and the second time you hold down X the crane will go up.
After you release the X button a second time, the crane will attempt
to grab something. A device in the crane will project an X on the
ground directly below the crane's position. When you're picking up
crates, get the X to land right in the middle of the crate.

Your first objective is to use the crane to pick up the three small
crates in the area below. Each time you manage to pick up a crate, the
crane will automatically drop it to the right of you. When you've
grabbed up all three crates, they'll form a bridge that you can use to
cross over into the next area. After you've done that, attempt to grab
the crate that's almost hidden amongst the larger crates in this room.
The key to getting it is to move the crane to the right for about only
a second, and then move it forward. Once you grab this crate, the crane
will drop it in front of you. It'll break open revealing a chest
containing Protectors. <You can actually get other items, besides the
Protectors, depending on which crate you leave behind after forming the
bridge. Other items you can get include an Ascension, Wisdom Fruit, and
Light Bangle. Thanks to Niclas Silfverduk, nicsi966@student.liu.se, for
telling me this.> Not only that, but you can also get all three items
in one play through. To do this, simply get one of the items and then
exit and reenter the room. The crates will be reset, allowing you to
pick up another item (Thanks to Michael for reminding me to add this
in).

Now cross the crate bridge you've made and head northwest to a door.
Go through that door and then the door after that. Follow this path
northwest and then walk on top of the big crates to reach the Flash
Shells. Go back the way you came, through the two doors, and then go
southeast. Head past the stair set going down, and then through the
doorway at the end of the path.

Hit the blue switch next to the door to raise a cat walk between here
and the beginning area. Now climb up the stairs near the blue switch
to reach the main hallway. Head southwest from the top of the stairs
and go through the door in the corner. Follow this path up to the end
where you'll find a chest containing Skill Ink. Exit this place the
way you came in, and head up the main hallway. Enter the first door on
the right and get the Ammonia from the drawer. Return to the main
hallway and go through the second door on the left. Check behind the
wall for a satchel containing 2400z, return to the main hallway, and
continue up the stairs to the northeast.

Examine the elevator panel in this room to perform an Id check. Since
you already have the Id Card, you can use the elevator freely. Ride the
elevator up and head up the stairs to the right to reach the bridge.
Have Momo examine the bridge controls and she'll figure out the ship's
guidance system. In order to activate the guidance system, you need to
run down to the main hallway and check the number on the boost counter
(it's in that second door on the right going northwest). The good thing
is that you won't have to fight random battles while you're doing this.
So go to the boost counter room in the main hallway and examine the
panel inside. You'll see that the number on the counter is going up.

When you're finished examining the counter (make sure to remember what
number the counter was on), you'll hear a consistant beeping. That
beeping is keeping time with the boost counter, so if the last number
you saw on the counter was 46, then the first beep will be 47, then the
next beep will be 48, then 49 and so on. Count the beeps in your head
as you make your way back to the bridge. Once you get back to the
bridge, wait until the count reaches 100. When beep number 100 sounds,
quickly talk to Momo and she'll activate the system. If you did it
right the ship will start moving and Momo will call everyone up to the
bridge. If not, then try again. Ryu's Eye will shine and point in god's
direction once everyone's on the bridge, and then the Black Ship will
head out to sea.

Since you don't know how long it will take to cross the ocean, all of
your party members will just hang out and relax (except Peco who keeps
getting chased by Honey). But this placid scene doesn't last for long,
as an alarm siren goes off without warning. Head up to the bridge to
see what's wrong. Momo will turn off the alarm and explain that
something has hit the bow of the ship. She'll then open the door that
leads to the front of the ship so that you can go investigate the
problem. Choose three party members, head down to the main hallway,
and go through the door in the southwest corner of the room. Head up
this hall and exit through the doorway that was closed before.

Frome here, go down the stairs to the northeast, and then head up the
next stair set after that. Walk to the right from the top of the stairs
and go through the doorway to the southeast. Pick up the Ivory Dice at
the other end of the room and exit the way you came in. Climb down the
next stair set, and then up the one after that. Go down the ladder to
the left, follow this path all the way around to a door, and go through
it. In this next area, head up the stair set on the right. Follow this
path northwest to a set of stairs going down. Walk to the left, past
those stairs, and follow this path to a chest containing a Soul Gem.
Now go down the stairs you passed before and take this path down to
another set of stairs. Climb down those stairs and the ladder just
south of those stairs. Head right and go up the ladder to get on top
of the crates in this room. Walk across the crates to reach a door at
the northwest corner of the room. Go through it and climb up the ladder
in this tiny area to reach the outer deck. Walk up to the bow of the
ship to find two giant sea monsters. Back up to the middle of the ship
as far as you can, and then prepare to fight the Ammonites.

---------------------
Boss fight: Ammonites
---------------------
HP: 2500 each
Exp- 9000 / Zenny- 1000 / Item- Moon Tears
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 27
Notes- The Ammonites are a tough pair to cope with. Aside from having
incredibly high attack power, these guys also have a nasty arsenal of
spells including Multi Strike, Tsunami, Blizzard, and a spell that
confuses (either Confuse or Hypnotize). You should start the battle by
having Ryu cast Shield three or four times, Rei cast Speed on everyone,
and Momo cast Might or War Shout (if you have it) on the party. Once
you've pumped everyone up with assist magic, Ryu should transform using
the Force, Eldritch, and either Gross or Defender genes. In Warrior
form, Ryu should use Focus on his extra turn, and then slam one of the
Ammonites with Aura. Have Momo keep helping the party with assist and
healing magic, and have Rei concentrate on stealing those precious
Moon Tears. Once you've eliminated one of the Ammonites, the battle
gets much easier. Have Rei use Weretiger, and let Ryu pummel the
remaining Ammonite with Aura until it goes down.

With another boss defeated go back down the ladder inside the ship.
And after a long voyage across the ocean, the Black Ship finally
arrives at the mysterious new land on the other side of the sea.

                  VIII. Technology of the Lost Shore

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you get off the Black Ship, you don't really know what to expect
in this strange new world, so Garr suggests that everyone stay alert.
Once your done talking, exit this dock to the north and emerge in the
port town of Kombinat.

                                --------
                                Kombinat
                                --------
Items:
Homing Bomb

This is a port town where machines are loaded and transported, but to
much surprise, even the people here don't know where the machines come
from. You'll also notice that, especially since over half the
population of this place consists of machine soldiers, Kombinat is the
most technologically advanced town you've been to so far. Spend a
little time talking to the people around here, and look for the robot
hidden behind some crates beside one of the buildings. Talk to it, and
the robot will pose a question to you in a language that you can't
interpret. Choose the third answer choise from the top, and the robot
will give you a Homing Bomb. Also, check out the weapon shop here for
some powerful merchandice. I just hope you've been saving your zenny.

Exit Kombinat when you're done browsing, and you'll automatically make
camp. While camping, some of your party members will converse with
their inner self to find out why they really came on this journey with
Ryu. You'll break camp when the scene ends and emerge in the Lost Shore
region.

                    -------------------------------
                    Exploring the Lost Shore Region
                    -------------------------------

You'll notice that this region is very barren compared to others that
you've been to. There's a fishing spot to the far east that's home to
the game's most hard to catch fish (There's also a Manillo there that
sells the coveted Life Armor and Royal Sword).

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Trance)- To the north lies a Yggdrasil tree's grove.
Enter the grove and check behind the tree for the Trance gene. Now, go
to the Steel Grave to the northeast of Kombinat.

                               -----------
                               Steel Grave
                               -----------
Items:
UV Glasses, Speed Boots, Spanner

Enemies:
Assassin, Audrey, Multi Bot Thrasher

First, head northwest from the junction, and follow this path all the
way up to a ladder hanging off a brown ledge. Climb up that ladder and
pick up the UV Glasses in the chest at the top. Go back down and climb
up the ladder a little ways southeast. Once you're at the top, slide
down the ramp to the right. Use your camera angles to check in the
small space on the right side of the ramp to find a chest containing
Speed Boots. Now walk to the right and climb up the next ladder. Go
northwest, past the two openings in the floor, and climb down the
ladder at the end of the walkway. If you brought Momo in your party,
have her blast away the weak door with her gun, and then head inside
the next room. Get the Spanner fishing rod in the chest in this room,
and then go back outside. When you get back outside, head southeast
past the two openings in the floor again, and take the dirt path to the
northeast. Follow this path all the way to the end to exit the Steel
Grave. Once you're back on the world map, rest if you need to, put Momo
in your party, and then enter the Colony to the north.

                               ----------
                               The Colony
                               ----------
Items:
Key, Deep Diver, Wisdom Fruit

Enemies:
Assassin, Codger, Thrasher, Toxic Man (1), (2), (3)

When you enter the Colony, the first thing you'll notice is the big
radar dish on top of the tower. Momo suggests that you go check it out,
so head up the three main stair sets ahead of you and go through the
doorway at the end. In this room you'll find a portal, just like the
one in the basement of castle Wyndia. Once you regain control, get the
Key in the satchel on top of the portal and exit the way you came in.
Head to the left and down the stairs.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Failure)- Jump off the ledge to the left, and check
around the northwest corner of this area to find the Failure gene. From
there, descend the stairs to the right and go through the doorway at
the bottom.

Check this room for a Deep Diver, and then exit the way you came in.
Now, go back up the stairs you just came down, and take the path to
the left of the stairs. Follow this path southeast, then northeast past
the ledge, and through the passageway at the end. Pass through this
small room, and exit it to the right. Climb up the stairs to the right,
and take this path all the way to the end to reach a chest containing
Wisdom Fruit. From there, back track a few steps to the ledge on the
side of the path. Jump off of it to plummit through a window and into
the next room.

Have Momo examine the panel to the right and insert the Key you found.
In order to activate the portal, you must align the three mirrors in
this room so that the laser beam will deflect off of them and hit the
fuse at the other end of the room. To adjust the mirrors, hit the
switch on its base. Turn the south mirror two times, the east mirror
two times, and the west mirror three times. Then hit the switch to
fire the laser and activate the portal. Now, exit this room to the
left, return to the portal room, and get on the portal to teleport out
of here.

Once you arrive at your destination, get off the portal and exit this
room. As soon as you leave the room, Honey will get away from you and
run off again. Follow Honey northeast and up the ladder at the end of
the path. From there, head right and through the door at the end of
the hall to emerge in the freighter at Steel Beach!? Yes it's true;
you just went all the way back across the sea to where you started in
an instant. While you're pondering about how you're ever going to see
god at this rate, Momo finds a connection between god and the portals.
She suggests that you all go back down to the portal to investigate,
so choose three party members and return to the room with the portal.

                          --------------------
                          Fixing Relay Point A
                          --------------------
Items:
Hourglass, Lacquer Staff, 4000z, Lacquer Shield, Barbarossa, Skill Ink

Enemies:
Codger, Dragon Fly, Insector, Reaper, Tank Bot

Inspect the panel next to the portal to find out that there's something
wrong with the antenna. Exit this room the way you came in, and head
southeast down the path. Go left at the corner and follow this path
over to a pair of stair sets. Ascend the stairs farthest to the left,
follow this path northwest, and go up the stairs at the end. From here,
walk right and down to the area with the four switches and the big
green block (let's just call this the "four switches area"). Examine
the green block, read the instructions, and reset the switches. The
four switches in this area (that have the red, blue, light green, and
brown dots on them) operate the jacks that raise and lower the four
beams in this area. Each switch can only be hit once without resetting
them all, and more than one jack can be lowered or raised by each
switch. First, hit the blue switch, pass under the eastern beam, and go
through the door there. In this next room, head up the stairs, go to
the right, and then go down the next set of stairs. Walk left along
this path and pick up the Hourglass in the chest.

Return to the four switches area and reset the switches. Once the
switches are reset, hit the light green switch and pass under the
southern beam. Head up the stairs to the right and go through the door
at the top. Take this next path all the way around, and go through the
doorway at the end. Walk left across the northern beam, and pick up the
Lacquer Staff in the chest. Then, go back to the four switches area and
reset the switches. Hit the blue, light green, and brown switches in
that order. Pass under the western beam, and go up the stairs to the
left. Walk across the west, south, and east beams, and then pass under
the northern beam to reach the big stair set. Climb up it, and then
head right. Use your camera angles to check around the east end of the
room for a satchel containing 4000z. Walk over to the southwest end of
this room and go up the stairs there.

In this room, you'll find a large pit with a pillar in the center.
Examine the diagram on the northern wall to find out that the switch
that unlocks the door in this room is on top of the pillar in the
center of the pit. In order to reach the switch, you must ride the
three floating platforms. When you get on a platform, it will move in
the opposite direction of where you got on it. It will keep moving
until it reaches the side of the pit or another platform. First, ride
the platform in the northeast corner to the left. Then ride the
southernmost platform up to line up all three platforms in the
northwest corner. Now, ride the rightmost platform downward. Go back
up to the northwest corner and ride the two platforms there to the
right. Ride the southernmost platform up, and then ride the platform
in the northeast corner to the left. Get back on that same platform
and ride it downwards to reach the pillar in the center. Step on the
switch, and then get back on the moving platform to open the locked
door.

Head through the door, and then go up the stairs to the left. Then head
right, ignoring the next set of stairs going up, and pick up the
Lacquer Shield in the chest at the end of the path. Now, go back and
head up the next stair set. Walk southeast and exit this area through
the passageway at the end. Pick up the Barbarossa in the chest and go
back inside. Head to the northwest end of this room and go through the
doorway there. Take this path left, go down the two small stair sets
at the end, and then climb up the next small stair set to reach a chest
containing Skill Ink. Now, exit this room through the doorway on the
left. Take this outside path to the right and through the next door.
Head northwest up this next path, and then go up the stairs to the
right. Ascend the next set of stairs and exit this room through the
doorway on the right. Walk left and climb up the ladder to finally
reach the antenna. Examine the control panel to find out how to fix
the antenna. Just turn it in the direction that makes the least amount
of static noise. Once it's fixed, go all the way back down to the
portal room.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Radiance)- Inspect its control panel, select the
Container Yard, and get on the portal. When you get to the Container
Yard, cross over the crate to the right and pick up the Radiance gene.
Then get back on the portal, return to Relay Point A, and then teleport
to the Dragnier.

Once you arrive at your destination, get off of the portal and exit
this room. When you emerge outside, you'll find yourself in a small
village in the middle of a barren wasteland. Strangely, when the people
see you come out of the portal room, they'll call for a celebration.
At the banquet, the people will reveal to you that they're all members
of the Brood race, and they recognized Ryu as one of them. It turns out
that the Brood survivors of the great war hundreds of years ago fled
to this place and gave up their powers so they could hide from the
Urkan god. After the banquet, Ryu will fall asleep and have a strange
dream. When you wake up, the lady in this room will tell you that the
rest of your group is waiting outside for you. So, check the drawers
in this room for a Skill Ink and then go outside.

Rei will be waiting for you outside, and he tells you that Garr's
feeling pretty glum right now. Head northwest to the area above the
portal room and talk to Garr. He explains to you how he feels about
being in a place surrounded by people who are his sworn enemies. And
after Rei adds a sagacious statement to the conversation, Griol will
confront you and tell you that the elder wishes to meet with you. Now,
exit the Dragnier back onto the world map, and put Garr and Nina in
your party. Then, return to the Dragnier and climb down the ladder in
the center of the village. Go down the ladder after that, and then
climb up the next ladder. Then, ascend the stairs at the top. Head
northeast up this next hallway and exit it at the end (But take note
to the mural on the wall because it should look very familiar). In this
next area, go through the first passageway on the right, and get the
Ivory Dice from this room. Exit the way you came in, and enter the last
room on the right to meet the elder.

Be sure to listen carefully to the conversations that you have with the
elder, so you know what's going on and why. First, Ryu will talk to
him, and then he'll want to speak with Garr. After the elder is done
talking to Garr, he'll want to talk to Nina. When he asks to talk to
Ryu again, be sure to leave and change party members first. Once you
have some more desirable members in your party, have Ryu approach the
elder and tell him that you're ready for what comes next. In a
nutshell, the full power of the Brood was invested into the elder, and
he wants to pass that power onto Ryu. But in order for that to happen,
Ryu must take the power from him. And since this underground room has
been reinforced with magic barriers to prevent this power from being
detected by Myria, Ryu will be unable to use his dragon powers. All I
can say is good luck, because it's time to battle the Elder.

-----------------
Boss fight: Elder
-----------------
HP: 5000
Exp- 6000 / Zenny- none / Item- Dynamite
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 30
Notes- This guy is a really tough brute considering he's hundreds of
years old, and that 5000 HP isn't going to be easy to reach without
your dragon form. The Elder has some really devastating spells which
include Inferno, Myollnir, and Sirocco. He also has Double Blow, which
can be really nasty in this battle, because the Elder has got some very
high attack power. Have Ryu cast Shield about three or four times, and
cast Barrier at least once on everybody. Rei should use Speed on anyone
who doesn't already have an extra turn, and Momo should increase
everyone's attack power by casting Might or War Shout. Then, have Ryu
use the most powerful spells and skills he has (That's dependant on the
skills that you've given him), and have Rei use Weretiger. Rei will
end up being your most vital attacker because if you increase his power
enough with assist magic, his attacks in Weretiger form will do
700-1000 damage. While Rei's pounding away at the Elder, Momo and Ryu
should concentrate on healing and attacking with their most powerful
spells when they get the chance.

**NEW DRAGON GENE (Infinity)- After the battle, the elder will fade
away leaving behind the very essence of the Brood's true power, the
Infinity gene. Pick it up and then go back outside (You should now
have all 18 genes!).

You'll talk to Griol once you get outside, and he tells you that the
goddess Myria is to the north across the desert. He assigns Horis to
guide you to the desert. So once you regain control, go speak with
Horis and tell him that you're ready to go. Then exit onto the world
map, head north, and enter the Factory.

                               -----------
                               The Factory
                               -----------
Items:
Wisdom Seed, Artemis' Cap, Skill Ink, Ammonia, Rockbreaker,
Aries Spear, Fish-head, Sage's Frock, Homing Bomb, Hourglass

Enemies:
Boss Goblin, Egg Gang, Giant Orc, Gold Egg, Hobgoblin, Pipe Bomb

Some parts of the Factory were a little confusing to write down, but I
tried my best to get it down. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out
where to go once you play through it. And also beware: the enemies here
are much tougher than those that you've encountered in new areas
before. First, head up the path and then down the sloping path to the
right to reach a junction. Walk up the incline going northeast, and
take this path around to a chest containing a Wisdom Seed. Go back down
to the junction and head right to another junction. Walk down the
sloping path farthest to the right and go southwest. Go northwest at
the next fork and follow this path up to a chest containing an Artemis'
Cap. Then return to the fork, head south down the sloping path, and go
west at the next junction. Take this path down all the way to the end
to find a Skill Ink in a chest. Go back to the junction, head right,
and take this path all the way up to a doorway going inside.

Once you're inside, go up the stairs on the right side of the hall and
pick up the Ammonia in the satchel in this small room. Then climb back
down the stairs and head up the hallway. Go through the doorway at the
end of the hall, and climb down the ladder hidden in the north end of
this small room. Pick up the Rockbreaker in the chest and climb back up
the ladder. Exit this room the way you first came in and take the dirt
path to the left. Follow it down and around to a junction. Head left
and follow this path up to a weak looking section of wall on the left.
Have Momo blast it away with her gun, and then go through the opening.
Get the Aries Spear inside and exit this small area the way you came
in. Return to the last junction, head right, and ascend the stairs to
the north. Go up the next set of stairs to the northwest, and then exit
this next area to the southeast. Pick up the Fish-head in the chest, go
back inside the way you came out, and descend the previous stair set.
Go through the door near the blue switch, but don't hit the switch.

From here, walk up to an area with some blue switches and electrical
livewire lines on the floor. The active livewire is impassible and you
will take damage if you walk into it. The swiches can either acivate or
deactivate certain livewire lines, so make sure your party members
aren't standing on any inactive lines before you hit any switches. The
two switches that are accessable to you right now also lower the
brownish-red cubes that are blocking your path, but they only stay
lowered for a short amount of time. To get where you need to go, first
hit the switch farthest to the left, and then hurry over to the other
switch. Hit it and then dash straight up the path across the two
lowered platforms to reach the stairs at the other end. Head down the
small stair set and then go through the door on the left. Walk
northeast up this hall, and then to the right at the corner. Go through
the first doorway on the left, and take this narrow path down to a
chest containing a Sage's Frock. Exit this area the way you came in,
continue down this hall, and go through the next doorway at the bend.

In this next area, Climb up the ladder to the left and head north.
Descend the stairs to the left and hit the blue switch at the bottom to
turn off the livewire line in this area. Pick up the Homing Bomb in the
chest above you, and then head back up the stairs you just came down.
Walk south and climb back down the ladder there. Head to the right, and
hit the blue switch next to the door. Go straight up a little ways and
hit the blue switch to the right of the stairs to raise a platform that
allows you to access those stairs. Head up the small ramp and stair set
to the left, and examine the panel on this platform. Read the
instructions to find out that the workbot in the area below can be used
to hit the switches in the area.

When you activate the workbot program, the robot will move however you
move (E.g. when you walk left, it will move to the left). When you
position the workbot near a switch, turn so that it faces the switch
and hit the Triangle button. Try to use the two cubic objects in the
area to manipulate the workbot. Hit all three switches, and then go
back down the stairs. Once again, head left and climb up the ladder at
the southwest end of this area. Walk northwest up this path, past the
stairs on the left, and go right at the junction at the end. At first,
ignore the door at the corner, and head down to the end of the path to
reach a chest containing an Hourglass. Now go through the door you
passed up before. Ascend the long staircase, and then slash the panel
to the left of the door with Ryu's sword. That will open the door, so
go through it to exit the Factory. Head north a small ways on the world
map and you'll set up base camp. It's time to cross the desert.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                        X. The Desert of Death

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At base camp, Horis will give you a briefing about the Desert of Death.
Talk to Horis again and he'll give you a list of help topics to choose
from. Make sure you read all the topics very carfully, especially when
he tells you about how to use the stars to travel. Refer to this
diagram in case you forget:

                                    N

                                    *north star

                                                    *fake north star

               *evening star

           W                                               E







                                    S

Remember that the north star will always be to the north, and it will
not change it's position at all. The fake north star is usually to the
northeast, and it can change position. The evening star is to the west,
it moves west as you walk north, and it sinks lower and lower in the
sky as you walk east. Also take note that it's four turns (or four
d-pad taps) to change a cardinal direction.

Here are the directions to the Oasis at the other end of the desert:
First, follow the north star for two nights so that the evening star
hangs in the sky directly to the west. Then head east until the
evening star sinks below the horizon and you can no longer see it (it
should be about two and a half nights). Once the evening star
disappears, head north again for about three nights, and you should
reach the Oasis.

This is another way to reach the Oasis, just in case the above
directions are hard to follow: First head north for two nights so that
the evening star is directly west and the fake north star is directly
northeast. Follow the fake north star, and you should reach the Oasis
after exactly four nights.

Be sure to follow these directions and not the directions that Horis
writes down for you, because they are wrong. When you're ready,
examine the big vase near the save book and fill your canteen with
water (you'll get 16 helpings). Then rest up, save your game, and head
out into the desert.

                         -----------------------
                         Traveling in the Desert
                         -----------------------

While walking in the desert, there are a few things you need to be
aware of:

Making/Breaking camp- A half of a day will pass each time you rest. Be
sure to make camp at daybreak, so that you'll break camp at nightfall.
If you set up camp too early, it'll still be daytime when you break
camp. When the sun stars to rise as you're walking, keep walking until
a message comes up telling you to make camp. To make camp press Start.

Water- You start with 16 helpings of water, and one helping is enough
for all three party members. About twice each night, a message will
come up saying that you should drink some water. When that happens,
take a few steps and use one helping of water from your item inventory.
Beware, if you walk too far without drinking any water, your max HP
will go down permanently.

Random battle fields- About two to three times a night you will enter
a random battle field. It's just like any ordinary battle field except
that sometimes you might get something extraordinary in the satchel
that can be found in each field. When you exit a random battle field,
make sure to use the stars to point yourself in the right direction,
because you may not be facing the right way.

When things go wrong- If you get completely lost and you run out of
water, there is a way out. Make camp and talk to the rakda (BoF3's
substitue for a camel). It'll take you back to base camp so that you
can start over.

For the last few nights, be sure to put desirable members in your
party. After the last night of walking, the Oasis will still be nowhere
in sight. Your group decides to try to climb to the top of an
inconspicuous hill, so that they can get a better look around. But as
you approach the hill, it will start to move and a huge desert monster
will emerge from it. It's time once again to do battle.

-----------------
Boss fight: Manmo
-----------------
HP: 3000
Exp- 6000 / Zenny- 1000 / Item- Power Food
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 30
Notes- Compared to the last boss you fought, the Manmo is a sinch. The
only major spells it has are Quake and Myollnir, and besides that, the
only thing you need to fret about is its high attack power and reprisal
rate. First, cast the usual assist magic. Have Ryu cast Shield a couple
of times, have Rei cast Speed on everyone, and have Momo use Might or
War Shout. Once you're done with assist magic, have Ryu transform using
the Infinity, Trance, and Radiance genes. In Kaiser form, use your
strongest physical attack skills (I personally prefer Shadowwalk or
Aura). Rei should use Weretiger, and Momo should back up the party
through healing and more assist magic. This guy doesn't have much HP
so you should be able to take him down quickly.

Once you've dealt with Manmo, you'll automatically make camp. It turns
out that the intense desert conditions have caused Nina to get a
severe heat stroke. You can't continue on with her in this condition,
so you have to do something. After you regain control, exit the tent
and you'll talk to Rei. He mentions the rakda, so go over and talk to
it. It seems that these creatures are useful for something other than
desert travel. So slash the poor thing with your sword. The meat of the
rakda has restoritive properties that can relieve a heat stroke.
Collect the rakda meat and go back to the tent. Talk to Rei again, and
then go back inside the tent. After giving her the meat, Nina regains
enough strength to make it to the Oasis with the rest of the group.

                                ---------
                                The Oasis
                                ---------
Items:
800z

When you arrive at the Oasis, your party will be exhausted and the
chief of the village invites you in to rest. And once everyone's been
given a chance to relax, Ryu and Garr ask the village chief about god.
The chief doesn't know anything about god, but he does tell you about
an ancient city to the north called Caer Xhan. Once Nina recovers,
choose three party members and explore the Oasis. Search the village
for 800z, and stock up on items at the local shop if you want. After
you've explored the village, exit the Oasis to the north (Take the path
in the middle of town going up the hill).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                          XI. Myria Station

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Desert region is very small, so there's not really much to explore.
But before you go to Caer Xhan, put Garr in your party and enter the
[?] spot to the right of Caer Xhan. Go inside the building in this
area, and have Garr push against the wooden crate to the right. The
crate will shatter, revealing two ladders that let you access the
portal here (And the Radiance gene if you haven't already gotten it).
You can now use the portals to travel freely anywhere in the world.
Now, return to the world map and enter Caer Xhan.

                                ---------
                                Caer Xhan
                                ---------
Items:
Protein, Moon Tears

Eventhough this place is an old, abandoned city, it's technology is
more advanced than any other place you been to yet. It's only remaining
inhabitants are the two machine soldiers that run the weapon and item
shops. Take the time to stock up on items and buy the best weapons and
armor you can afford, because you're going to need them.

Caer Xhan Item Shop           Caer Xhan Weapon Shop
-------------------           ---------------------
Healing Herb- 10z             Seeking Sword- 20000z

Wisdom Ring- 3000z            Mind Shield- 18000z
Lion's Belt- 3000z            Sun Mask- 7200z

From the area where the shops are, go left and down the small stair set
on the side of the road. Then head down the next set of stairs just to
the south. Walk southeast and go inside the small building at the end
of the path. Search this room for a Protein, and return outside to the
area where the shops are. Head up the street going northeast, and enter
the building on the left at the street's end. Go forward a little ways
to find a small robot on thr ground that looks just like Honey. Well
that's weird.

Anyway, continue northwest up the hall into the next room. Walk up this
next hallway and climb up the stairs at the end. Proceed to the left,
staying as far away from the checkered area as possible. Don't be
tempted to go after that chest just yet, because you'll see why. Go
down the stairs at the left end of the room, and go through the door at
the bottom. Hit the blue switch in this room to turn off the lights.
Exit this room the way you came in and climb back up the stairs. With
the lights off, the moving laser beams guarding the checkered area
should now be visible. Avoiding the lasers, make you way over to the
chest in the middle and pick up the Moon Tears inside. Then, head over
to the large staircase at the right end of the room, and climb up it.
Head right and carefully make your way across the checkered area here.
Exit this room through the doorway on the left.

From here, head north to another door going inside, and go through it.
Examine the large computer terminal at the other end of the room,
deactivate the emergency lockout mode, and choose "OK" for Platform 1.
Then, exit this room the way you came in, and walk southwest to a
ledge. Jump off of it and go left to reach the street. Walk northwest
up the street and go inside the building at the end. Examine the small
terminal to open the gate at the top of the stairs. Head up the stairs
to the left and pass through the open gate. Follow the purple tile and
exit this room to the right. When you get outside, you'll hear a
message over a loud speaker saying something about the Orbital Station
Myria. Once you regain control, climb up the stairs and get on the
platform to ride it to Myria Station. After you arrive, get off the
platform and head up to the station's main entrance. It's locked, so
you're going to have to use the Worker's Area. Head to the right from
the main entrance, and go down the stairs at the end of the path to get
inside.

                      ----------------------------
                      Myria Station: Worker's Area
                      ----------------------------
Items:
Gas Shells, Wisdom Fruit, 800z, Hourglass, Napalm, 400z, Life Shard (2)

Enemies:
Adept, Armor, Death bot, Nitemare, Tank Bot

First head southeast down this hall to a junction near an elevator
shaft. Walk right and then downwards to a passageway. Go through it and
pick up the Gas Shells in the chest. Head back inside and return to
where the elevator shaft is. Take the path to the right of the lift
around and northwest to a doorway leading outside. Walk up this path
all the way to the end and check the end of the narrow path to the left
for a Life Shard. Go back inside, return to the junction, and climb up
the stairs to the left of the elevator shaft. Hit the blue switch near
the elevator, and then go back down the stairs. Examine the elevator
panel and ride the elevator to the Arrival Platform. Once you're there,
get the Wisdom Fruit inside the chest, and then ride the elevator down
to the Maintenance Deck. Head up this outside path, and ride the
elevator at the end up to the Worker's Area. Now, go through the door
on the left and pass through this next small room. In this next area,
head right and follow the hallway around to a stair set. Climb up it
and examine the two panels in this small area.

Once you've released the main entrance and laser locks, go back down
the stairs and head left. Take this hallway all the way around, and go
through the unlocked door on the right (the one that's just before the
next stair set). Check the cabinets and lockers in this room for 800z,
an Hourglass, and Napalm. Be sure to use the rest and save area in this
room as often as you need to. When you're done here, exit back into the
hallway. Go up the stairs at the end of the hall, check this small room
for 400z, and exit through the doorway to emerge in Myria Station's
main room.

Take time to explore the main room. The station's main entrance is now
unlocked and is to the southeast. Also, check the cabinets at the east
end of the room for a Life Shard. One thing that you're sure to notice
is the gold and green colored tile. These aren't there just for show.
They're actually paths that guide you to different parts of the
station. Your first stop is the main laboratory, so follow the gold
path to the upper level of the main room, and go through the door at
the end.

                        -------------------------
                        Myria Station: Laboratory
                        -------------------------
Items:
10000z, Holy Robe, Swallow Eye, Ammonia, Skill Ink, Ivory Dice, Slicer,
HE Shells, Giant Shield, Dragon Shield, Dragon Helm, Demonsbane

Enemies:
Clone, Hopper, Ice Drake, Newt, Red Drake

First, ride the conveyor belt going northwest to the other end of the
room. Then, take the narrow path to the left of the conveyor belts down
to a chest containing 10000z. Now, exit this room through the door in
the northwest corner. Pass through the healing room and head up this
next hall. Go through the northernmost door at the end of the hall, and
pick up the Holy Robe in this small room. Exit the way you came in, and
leave this hallway through the doorway on the left. Continue up the
golden path and go through the door at the very end. When you enter
this room, you'll see a horrible monster sleeping in the adjacent room.
You'll spot a key card on the ground in front of the monster, so you'll
have to go get it. Once you regain control, examine the panel in this
area to turn off the sleeping gas in the adjacent room. Pick up the
Swallow Eye from the cabinet, and then exit this room the way you came
in. Follow the gold path back down, and enter the first room on the
right (going from northwest to southeast). Grab the Ammonia at the left
end of the room, and examine the small panel at the right end of the
room.

There are three panels (two in this room and one in the next room) that
control the flow of electricity in the shock floor in the next area.
Your objective is to create a clear path across the shock floor so that
you don't take much, or any damage while walking across it. When you
examine a panel, three grids will appear, but you can only control one
grid at each panel. To cut off the flow of electricity, you need to
align the pluses (red) and the minuses (blue). You can adjust the grid
by hitting right or left on the d-pad. For example, if a - is in a spot
on one grid and a + is in the same spot on another grid, then no
electricity will be running to the corresponding spot on the shock
floor. Once you've made a desired adjustment, hit X to confirm it, and
you'll get a brief birds-eye view of the adjusted shock floor. From
left to right, adjust the first panel in this room 2 times to the left,
and adjust the second one 2 clicks to the right. Now, exit this room
the way you came in, and continue down the gold path. Go inside the
next room on the right, and adjust the panel in here 1 time to the
left. Then head up the small stair set to the right, and carefully
walk across the shock floor. Ride the lift on the other side down.

From here, head right and continue to the right at the junction. Take
this path down, and exit it through the passageway at the end. Check
around this area for a chest containing Skill Ink, and then exit the
way you came in. Return to the junction, walk left, and exit this short
hallway through the doorway at the end. Go left and then northwest.
Head through the next door on the right, and take this hall all the way
up to a dead end. Check around this area for an Ivory Dice, back track
down the hall a ways, and then go through the next door. Ride the left
up, pick up the Slicer in the chest in this next area, and then go
inside the next room to come face to face with the monster. But just as
you think you're going to have an easy time snatching that key card,
the monster awakens with a literally glass-shattering scream. It's time
to fight the Chimera.

-------------------
Boss fight: Chimera
-------------------
HP: 7500
Exp- 9000 / Zenny- 2000 / Item- Firecracker
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 35
Notes- The Chimera shouldn't give you too much trouble, that is, if you
don't take it too lightly. The major attack that you should be
concerned with is the Paralyzer. Like its name suggests, this attack
causes paralysis, a nasty status change that you probably haven't seen
too much of yet in this game. If everyone in your party gets paralyzed,
it's all over, so don't let that happen. The only other thing you
should worry about are its attack spells like Inferno and Blizzard,
which do moderate damage. Start the battle by having Ryu cast Shield,
Rei cast Speed on anyone who doesn't have an extra turn, and Momo use
Might or War Shout on the party. Then Ryu should transform into the
Kaiser using the Infinity, Trance, and Radiance genes, and hit the
beast with strong attack skills like Shadowwalk or Triple Blow (That
is, if he can spare the AP. If you're low on AP, use the Force and
Gross genes, and bash away with Aura). Have Rei wait until the end of
the fight to use Weretiger, just so he can help cure anyone who gets
paralyzed. Momo should keep the party healthy and throw in some attack
spells like Myollnir when she can.

After you defeat the Chimera, pick up the card key it was guarding.
It's a level-B security card key, but it doesn't look very important.
Then, ride the lift the Chimera was sitting on down. Exit this room
through the doorway, and pick up the HE Shells in the chest. Continue
to the right and into the next area. Have Rei pick the lock on the next
door, and then get the Giant Shield, Dragon Shield, and Dragon Helm
from the three chests. Now, go all the way back to the station's main
room. From there, go back to the part of the Worker's Area where there
were two locked doors that required key cards. Unlock and go through
the level-B door using the card you just got, and get the Demonsbane in
the chest. Also note the small army of robots that look just like
Honey. Now, return the the main room again, and follow the green path
to the upper level of the room. Then, go through the door at the end to
reach the path to Eden.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               XII. Eden

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, ride the escalator up, and exit this area through the door on
the left. Pass through the healing room, and walk right to find a door
overgrown by harmful plants. Have Momo equip the HE Shells and shoot
down the plants so you can access the door (Note- If you have to go
back and put Momo in your party, while you're there, place Rei in your
party also). Then go through the door.

In this next area, head northwest at the junction and pick up the
Protein in the chest at the end of the path. Return to the junction
and go northeast. Head around the corner and onto the grassy area at
the end of the path. Walk upwards and to the left to reach an incline
going down this hill. Go down it and get the Magic Shard in the chest.
Then, head up this grassy area, and climb over the hill on the left.
Walk southeast from there to get back on the path. Take this path all
the way up and around to a locked door. Have Rei pick the lock, and
then go inside. Check the cabinets in this room for a Ginseng and a
Wisdom Fruit, and then exit through the doorway at the other end (Also
be sure not to step on any plants in this room, or you'll take damage).
From here, head left and check behind the trees along this stretch to
find a chest containing a Silver Tiara. Continue to the left, over the
small knoll, to reach a door in the northwest corner of this area. Go
through it, get the Dragon Spear in the chest, and then exit the way
you came in. Walk back down to the grassy area, and climb up the stairs
there. Take this path to the right, and go through the door at the end.
Head up this next hallway, and ride the lift at the end up to Eden
***CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD***.

When the lift reaches Eden, you'll be amazed at the outdoor-like
scenery. But, you're still just inside another room. Head south from
the lift to reach a chest containing Force Armor. Return to the lift
and head north to find a chest containing a Soul Gem. From there, go
left and cross the bridge going across the stream. Once you get to the
other side, you'll see some birds fly over to the Brood warrior who
beckoned you in your dreams as a child. But this time there's something
strangly familiar about him. It's Teepo!? After practically ignoring
Rei's excitement about him being alive, Teepo will talk to Ryu. You'll
see a flashback about how Teepo found out he was a dragon, and you'll
flashback to other scenes in the past. Then, Teepo will cut to the
chase and ask Ryu to relinquish his powers. When Ryu refuses, Teepo
sends Ryu into a deep dream where he'll be able to look into the
thoughts and hearts of him and his friends.

                               -----------
                               Ryu's Dream
                               -----------
Items:
Shaman's Ring, Hourglass, Gems

Enemies:
Mad Gong, Thanotos, Vile Weed

The bad part about the dream maze, is that it can be a confusing
mission, and you have to fight random battles with just Ryu. The good
part is, that it's the last hard mission in the game. And remember to
listen closely to what all of your party members have to say, because
I won't put it down. First, head northwest to the next lit section of
the path to find Nina. She'll talk to you a few times as you continue
through this area. Listen to Nina, and then examine the dragon statue.
It tells you to go back, so go back to where you just came from to find
Rei. Hear what he has to say, and then inspect the dragon statue to
heal yourself and save your game.

Continue northwest to find a dragon statue with a plaque on either
side of it. Examine the plaque to the left, and then try to get the
chest on the left. You'll fall through the floor. Inspect the statue
in this area, and tell it that you really want what's in the box. Then,
walk left and pick up the Shaman's Ring in the chest. Head northeast
and step into the swirling shaft of light to get transported back near
the rest/save point. Continue northwest from the save point again, and
return to the area with the dragon statue and the two plaques. Examine
the statue, and it'll tell you to pray in front of it. This is where
most people lose it. After talking to it, stand there and don't move
until it illuminates the path ahead. From the next patch of light, head
northeast to another part of the path. Walk southeast from there to
reach the chest containing Gems that you couldn't reach before. Return
to the main path and this time go southwest to another side path
leading to an Hourglass (in another chest that you couldn't access
before). Go up the main path, and you'll find Momo. Listen to her,
continue up the path, and walk into the swirling shaft of light to get
transported to a new area.

In this area, you'll find colored portals on the ground that can
transport you to different parts of this area. From here, head left
from the first junction. Go right at the next junction, and then left
at the one after that. Follow this path down, and step onto the yellow
portal at the end. Now, walk northeast to find Garr. Talk to him,
continue up the path, and then step onto the purple portal to the left.
Then, head right at the next junction and northwest at the one after
that. Transport yourself using the green portal, and then listen to
Peco (Yep, that's right, he can talk). Afterwards, continue up the path
and step onto the blue portal. You'll encounter a likeness of yourself,
but when Teepo gives himself away, you walk right through the fake
image. Continue up the path a little ways to find Teepo. Seeing that
you're still not going to give up your power, Teepo leaves you battle
with a monster and stay in your dream forever.

-----------------
Boss fight: Arwan
-----------------
HP: 2250
Exp- 5000 / Zenny- none / Item- none
Recommended team- Ryu
Recommended level- 38
Notes- The Arwan's not too hard. The attacks you need to look out for
are Blizzard, Chill, and Sleep. Blizzard and Chill are frost attacks
which do moderate damage, and you've seen Sleep before so I don't have
to explain that. Equip the Dream Ring, and then hit Arwan with the most
powerful holy property attacks you have. Aura in warrior form will do
over 2000 damage to this guy, but if you have any holy attacks that are
less costly AP wise, use them instead. If you have a Holy Avenger,
equip it and use your most powerful melee skills, such as Shadowwalk,
to deal some massive damage without using dragon form. You're going to
want to beat this guy using as little AP as you can afford to, because
believe me, you want to come out of this battle with as much AP as
possible.

Once you've put an end to Arwan, Ryu will be brought out of his dream.
Teepo explains that you wouldn't have died if you were beaten by Arwan;
you would just lose your power. Realizing that you won't give up your
powers freely, Teepo decides that the only alternative left is to kill
you. Choose three party members and a formation, and choose them well
because Teepo's not kidding around. Get ready to fight Dragon Lord.

-----------------------
Boss fight: Dragon Lord
-----------------------
HP: 13000
Exp- 15000 / Zenny- 3000 / Item- Dragon Blade, Dragon Armor
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 38
Notes- Teepo is definitely the most powerful boss you've battled yet.
He's got a very strong arsenal of spells including Inferno, Blizzard,
Myollnir, Triple Blow, and Howling. Believe it or not, his most deadly
spell is probably Howling, because mass confusion among your party
members in a fight like this can cost you the whole battle. To counter
this, make sure everyone has some sort of protection against confusion
(Balance Rings will suffice). For this battle, it's best to leave the
assist magic to Rei and Momo, and to have Ryu use Accession right off
the bat. If Ryu has a lot of AP, the ultimate Kaiser form (Infinity,
Trance, and Radiance genes) is ideal. You'll automatically gain that
vital protection against confusion, and your stats will go through the
roof. After a War Shout or two, Shadowwalk in this form, for me, did
1600-1800 damage every time. But if you don't have much AP, it's best
to use the Force and Gross genes. While Ryu's pounding away in dragon
form, have Rei cast Speed on anyone who doesn't have an extra turn, and
have Momo use spells like Protect, Shield, Barrier, Might, and War
Shout on the party. Once Rei is done speeding everyone up, he should
use Weretiger. Momo should continue to cast assist magic throughout
the entire battle, and of course, she should heal the party when
necessary. If you take a look at Dragon Lord's HP, you'll see that
this isn't going to be a short fight. But, just keep at it and you'll
emerge victorious.

Even in his final moments, Teepo will still side with Myria. But, in
his last breaths, he tells you that all he ever wanted was for life to
be the way it was when you were just kids. He'll then turn into a Whelp
dragon and fade away, leaving behind Card Key A. Pick it up, ride the
lift back down, and return to the main room. Go back to the Worker's
Area and unlock the level-A security door there. Pick up the Light
Bangle inside and, once again, go back to the main room. Have you
noticed that door at the left end of the main room that's been locked
this whole time? Well, with this new card key you can unlock it. That
door leads to the final stretch. Compared to crossing an ocean and a
desert, there's not much more standing between you and the goddess.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                     XIII. The Final Confrontation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a fair word of warning; the random battle enemies in this area are
extremely tough, so make sure your characters' levels are at least in
the high 30's. Anyway, first head up the hallway and go right at the
first junction. Walk northwest at the next junction, and then left at
the fork after that. Follow this path down and go through the door at
the end to reach a strange new area.

                      ----------------------------
                      The Reminiscent Battle Rooms
                      ----------------------------
Items:
Swallow Eye, Moon Tears, Cupid's Lyre, Hourglass

In this next area, you'll find a maze of rooms that collectively make
up what I like to call The Reminiscent Battle Rooms. Each outside door
in this area is marked with a light above it. White lights mark rooms
that you've already been too, and red lights mark rooms that you
haven't been to. Red-marked doors may be locked or unlocked. In these
rooms, you can fight old bosses all over again, but there's an even
stranger twist to it. There may be more than one of them. Here's a list
of old bosses you can fight:

- 5 Rockies
- 3 Stallions (Each with it's own element; frost, electric, and flame)
- Manmo
- 2 Huge Slugs
- Angler
- 2 Ammonites
- 3 Nues
- 2 Mikbas
- Gaist

Also, near the area where the Manmo is, there's a new boss to fight;
the Dodo (Sample 4). I didn't put the boss stats down for him just
because he's fairly easy to beat. But if you want the boss stats, I
can e-mail them to you. As you're making your way through the maze,
you'll come across rooms with chests inside containing a Swallow Eye
and Moon Tears. There's a save room and a room where you can rest
within the maze, and your first objective should be to find it. The
great thing is that you don't have to fight random battles here. But
if the battles from the previous hall wore you out, the best way to
reach the rest/save rooms is to head left from the beginning, that way
you only have to fight the 5 Rockies and 3 Stallions before you get
there. Even when you reach the rest/save room, you should still
continue to explore the maze and fight all the old bosses you can,
because you could use the practice and the Exp.

When you get to the save room, head through the door to the right of
the save book to reach the room where you can rest. Rest up, grab the
Cupid's Lyre in the chest, and return to the save room to save your
game. Now, if there's anything you need to do, anything at all (like
side quests, leveling up, ect...) do it now because you're approaching
the game's end. Take care of any unfinished business, and then descend
the ladder in the southern corner of the room.

                        ------------------------
                        The Long Awaited Meeting
                        ------------------------
Enemies:
Goo King, Mist Man, Night Bat, Revenant, Vampire

Once you reach the bottom of the stairs, Honey will take off again, and
you know what that means by now. Follow her down the hall, and you'll
witness Honey opening a huge gate that was blocking your path. It turns
out that Honey is a Navigator, a type of robot designed to guide people
through Myria Station. Continue up the hall and go down the lift at the
end to reach the core of the station. This next hallway will light up,
and one of Myria's servants will appear. Walk down the hallway and go
through the doorway at the end (Note- This is the last area where you
will have to fight random battles, so equip the Holy Mantle and walk,
don't dash, through this hall to lessen the chances of having to fight
here). The path in this last area is pretty straightforward. Follow it
all the way around, listening carefully to the messages that come up
along the way, and ride the small lift at the end to the centermost
platform. Ryu's Eye will shine, and finally, the goddess Myria will
appear before you.

Pay close attention to your conversation with Myria, because I'm not
going to give anything away here. Eventually, she'll tell Ryu to choose
his own fate. Talk to all of your friends, and then talk to Myria
again. You'll be posed with the game's final question; to give up your
power and live in a world controlled by Myria, or keep your Brood
powers and journey into a world covered by desert. Make this decision
based on the opinion of Myria, your party members, and most of all
yourself. If you choose to give up your power, you won't fight the
final boss, and you won't see the game's real ending. But if you choose
your own path, Myria will have no choice but to kill you. Carefully
pick three party members and a battle formation. It's time to show the
goddess what the Brood is really made of!

-----------------------
Final boss fight: Myria
-----------------------
HP: 20000
Exp- none / Zenny- none / Item- Napalm
Recommended team- Ryu, Rei, Momo
Recommended level- 40
Notes- Well, this is it, the final battle. Myria has a huge array of
all the game's major spells including Inferno, Blizzard, Myollnir,
Sirocco, Death, and Restore. But that's just the beginning. Her
trademark spell is Venom, which hits all of your party members with
several different status changes including blindness and poison. Evil
Eye can be equally devastating because it paralizes. Near the end of
the fight, Myria will cast Holocaust which does about 150 damage to all
of your party members. Like the battle with Dragon Lord, you'll want to
beat Myria as quickly as possible, so have Ryu transform using the
Infinity, Trance, and Radiance genes right away. Believe me, the
benefits of the ultimate Kaiser form definitely outweigh the high AP
usage in this fight (For me, Shadowwalk did 1500-2000 damage every
time). Just make sure you have a healthy supply of Wisdom Fruits, and
you'll be able to maintain the Kaiser form. Eventhough Myria can use
Sanctuary to negate your assist spells, she doesn't use it often, so
have Rei and Momo cast spells like Speed, Protect, Shield, Might, and
War Shout to help the party. Once you're done casting assist magic, Rei
should expend most of his AP using the strongest attack skills he has,
and then he should use Weretiger (Tip- If you have two Holy Avengers,
equip one to Rei and have him use the other one on himself. His normal
attack will do a lot more damage). Momo should concentrate on keeping
everyone's HP near or at maximum at all times, and she should also
supply Ryu with Wisdom Fruits when his AP gets low. The best advice I
can give for this battle is to keep your HP up. If you find yourself
in a desperate situation (such as low HP and bad status changes), use
your rare and valued items, like Moon Tears or Hourglasses, to save
you. After all, this is the battle you've been saving them for. My
final words of wisdom to you are to not hold anything back. This is
the game's final battle, so pull out all the stops and use spells like
Bonebreak and Celerity. Good luck!

Congratulations on defeating the final boss and beating the game! Now
sit back, relax, and enjoy the game's ending (And the cool Japanese
credits at the end). But don't be hasty to turn off the game when you
reach the fin screen. Wait and save your gave under cleared save.

                      6. Dragons and Their Genes

=======================================================================

The entire BoF series is unique because of the main character's, Ryu's,
ability to transform into different kinds of dragons. BoF3's dragon
gene system, though, is probably the best out of the four games that
are currently on the market. The dragon gene system allows you to
create different dragon forms by "splicing" up to three different genes
together. You attain these genes along your journey by gaining them
naturally, or by finding them encased in chrysm ore in certain places.
There are 18 genes in all, and here's a list of them.

When you use Accession, a menu will come up displaying all of the genes
you have. Select "Pick" to begin splicing genes. You can pick up to
three genes to be in the splicing, and the AP costs of the genes that
you are using are added together to make the total AP cost for the
transformation. You can also select "Data" to pick from a list of gene
combinations that you've used recently. From that list, you can add a
gene combination to your "Best" list by hitting the Square button.

While in dragon form, you will expend AP every turn (or every two turns
if you have an extra turn). The amount of AP you lose each turn depends
on the form you're in and the genes you used. If you don't have enough
AP to maintain dragon form when the time comes to lose AP, you will
revert back into your normal form. You will also return to your human
form if your HP as a dragon reaches zero. You can also choose to revert
back to human form by selecting it from the dragon abilities list.

                        =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The special abilities that each dragon transformation yields relies
almost entirely on the genes that you use. In many cases, certain genes
(especially the elemental genes) will grant abilities pertaining to it.
There are also other skills and spells that may come up as a result of
specific combinations of genes. Now here is a listing of these basic
gene combination-ability yields (Note- These apply only to the dragon
types that have elemental variance, which include Whelp, Dragon,
Behemoth, and Warrior. These will be covered in more detail in the next
section).

Gene Combination | Standard Abilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Flame            | Flame Claw, Flame Breath

                             Dragon Types
                             =-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a list of all the different types of dragons that you can
transform into. First there will be a paragraphed description of the
type of dragon, followed by a general ability list, typical gene
combinations that produce that type of dragon, and stat changes for HP,
Power, and Defense for basic types. The percentages for the stats
represent the percent of Ryu's stats in normal form, with a 100%
signifying no change. Also take note that I will not be listing AP
cost, as it is easy to calculate yourself. The initial transformation
cost is simply the combined costs of all the genes you use. AP
consumption per turn is always half of the initial transformation cost
(rounding up when there is a decimal). Now, on to the list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Whelp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your typical baby dragon. Whelps are very small and have tiny claws and
wings. They are elementally diverse, which means that they can have
either a Flame, Frost, Electric, Radiance, Shadow, or normal property.
Whelps usually provide only a small increase in stats, but that greatly
varies depending on the genes you use.

Special abilities:
Whelp Breath
Blind
Elemental Claw/Breath

Typical gene combinations: Single elemental genes, Defender, Thorn,
Reverse, Gross, Eldritch, Element+Gross, Any combination with Failure
not including Infinity, Element+Reverse

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Dragon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A large full grown Whelp. They look just like stereotypical dragons,
having large wings and a long tail. Dragons are elementally diverse,
and they usually give a moderate increase in HP, power, and defense.
But again, this depends on the genes you're using.

Special abilities:
Dragon Breath
Snap
Elemental Claw/Breath

Typical gene combinations: Element+Defender, Element+Thorn,
Element+Defender+Thorn, Element+Defender+Reverse,

Def- 110%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Behemoth
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A huge and heavily built beast that walks on four short legs. The
Behemoth has large spikes on its back, and it breathes very heavily.
They are elementally diverse, and very unique because the
transformation fuses all of your party members together into one being.
Behemoths give a sharp increase in HP, power, and defense, but they
typically have low agility.

Special abilities:
Meteor Strike
Charge

Elemental Claw/Breath

Typical gene combinations: Most combinations using Miracle

                                Mammoth
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks just like the Behemoth, except they're a brownish gold color.
However, Mammoths do not have elemental counterparts, and they fuse all
of your party members into one creature. They have more HP than any
other dragon, and besides that, their stats are similar to a
Behemoth's, with the exception of bad defense.

Special abilities:
Meteor Strike
Giant Growth

Typical gene combinations: Most combinations using Miracle and ???

are not elementally diverse, and their stats are very similar to those
of normal dragons.

                                 Warrior
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Warriors are half human and half dragon in appearance. They have a
human-like figure, but have wings and a tail. Warriors have elemental
counterparts, and they specialize in power and agility. Their downfall
is their low HP.

Special abilities:
Aura
Gambit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks just like the Warrior, except they're a tan and orange color.
Myrmidons don't have elemental counterparts, and their stats are
similar to those of a Warrior's, except their HP and power are a lot
higher.

                                 Tiamat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A very large, blue serpant that hovers in a coiled up position. They
are similar to Behemoths because the transformation fuses all of your
party members into one being. Tiamats have a good amount of HP and
otherwise well-rounded stats, as well as immunity to all negative
status changes. A very good dragon form indeed!

Special abilities:
Doom Breath
Shadow Breath
Venom Breath

                                Wildfire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A close and powerful reletive to the Whelp. The Wildfire looks just
like a Whelp, except it's a redish-orange color, and they're one of a
kind. This form greatly reduces your HP, but it gives a strong increase
in power, and an unbelievable rise in defense.

Special abilities:
Whelp Breath
Charge

Typical gene combinations: Miracle+Thorn+Reverse

                                 Hybrid
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are probably the most unique dragons in the game. The Hybrid
dragon takes on the characteristics of your other party members,
therefore their appearance and stats vary. There's a Hybrid form for
each of your party members, except Garr (he's a guardian after all).

Special abilities:

Rei Hybrid- Shadowwalk, Dragon Breath, Tempest
Nina Hybrid- Temptation, Typhoon, Lightning, Inferno, Blizzard
Momo Hybrid- Combustion, Speed, Protect, Might, Restore, Remedy
Peco Hybrid- Geo Breath, Dream Breath, Venom Breath, Dragon Breath

Super Rei Hybrid- Shadowwalk, Dragon Breath, Hurricane
Super Nina Hybrid- Temptation, Typhoon, Lightning, Inferno, Blizzard,
                   Sirocco, Myollnir
Super Momo Hybrid- Combustion, Speed, Protect, Might, Restore, Remedy,
                   Vitalize, Ragnarok
Super Peco Hybrid- Gaea's Breath, Dream Breath, Venom Breath,
                   Dragon Breath

Typical gene combinations:

Rei Hybrid- Fusion (With Rei and Momo or Rei and Nina in your party)
Nina Hybrid- Fusion (With Nina and Peco or Nina and Garr in your party)
Momo Hybrid- Fusion (With Momo and Nina or Momo and Peco in your party)
Peco Hybrid- Fusion (With Peco and Rei or Peco and Garr in your party)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Kaiser
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ultimate dragon form. After transforming, Ryu appears the same,
except he is a radiant golden color. There are basically three kinds
of Kaiser dragons; controlled, uncontrolled, and ultimate. The
controlled Kaiser gives you a moderate raise in stats, and the
uncontrolled Kaiser grants you very high stats, but is completely
berserk. The ultimate Kaiser, however, provides the greatest increase
in stats, it's not berserk, and best of all it's completely resistant
to status changes. The only down fall of this form is the huge AP cost
(53 AP for the initial transformation and 27 AP per turn. Believe me,
if your max AP is low, that hurts).

Special abilities:
Kaiser Breath
Howling
Bonebreak
All abilities of Ryu

Typical gene combinations:
Infinity+Failure for controlled
Infinity+Radiance+Trance for ultimate
All other combinations using Infinity are uncontrolled

These are just the most common dragons and gene combinations. To really
get the most out of the gene system, you have to experiment and try all
the gene combos you can think of.

=======================================================================

                              8. Masters

=======================================================================

Another thing that makes BoF3 unique from other RPG's is its master
system. Along your journey you'll come across masters, people or things
that teach others the skills they know. But most masters won't just
take you under their wing for nothing. There's usually a requirement
that you have to meet before a master will take you on as an
apprentice. When you're under a master, your stats will raise
differently when you level up. Typically, some stats will go up more
and others will go up less depending on the master. There's two good
ways to approach the double-edged sword of the master system:

Aggressive: Play to your strengths. All of your party members have
stats that are naturally low, and others that are naturally high. Put
your characters under masters that will boost the stats that are
already high for them, and disregard their low stats. Examples- Rei
under Meryleep, Garr under Bunyan, Nina or Momo under Emitai.

Conservative: Strengthen your weaknesses. You never know when you'll
run into an enemy that can exploit your weaknesses. Eliminate your
weaknesses so your characters will be well-rounded. Examples- Garr
under Meryleep, Nina under Bunyan, Rei under Mygas or Emitai.

Besides the change in stats, of course, you'll also be able to learn
new skills while under masters. If you level up enough levels to gain
a new skill, just go talk to your master and they'll grant it to you.

=======================================================================

                         9. Enemy Encyclopedia

=======================================================================

Here is an in-depth listing of all of the game's random battle
monsters, as well as some sub-bosses. The main list in alphabetical
order will come first, and will be followed by an enemy list by
location. Each enemy on the main list will have this setup:

----------
Enemy Name
----------

HP- The amount of health the enemy has (a ~ indicates an approximation)
Exp- Total amount of experience points the enemy yields
Zenny- Normal amount of money the enemy drops
Steal Item- Item that can be stolen/dropped by the enemy
Drop Item- Item that can ONLY be dropped by the enemy
Location- Places/dungeons where the enemy can be found
Abilities- The spells and skills that the enemy can use

Notes- Observations about the enemy as well as strategies for defeating
the enemy.

Please take note that boss stats will not appear in this section. Refer
to the point of the walkthrough at which the boss is encountered to
view boss stats. Also, the stats for the Archmage and Berserker can be
found in the Challenge Monsters section. Now, without further delay,
here is the main list.


                  ==================================
                  Enemy List (In Alphabetical Order)
                  ==================================

-----
Adept
-----

HP- 190
Exp- 650
Zenny- 550
Steal Item- Holy Robe
Drop Item- Shaman's Ring
Location- Myria Station
Abilities- Magic Shuffle, Meditation

Notes- The Adept is probably one of the weakest enemies that you'll
find the the main and worker's areas of Myria Station. They usually
like to spend their first turn casting Meditation to power up their
magic attacks and then use Magic Shuffle, which casts a random spell.
Due to their low HP you can probably take these guys down using regular
attacks without too much difficulty. Just don't toy around with them,
because Magic Shuffle can sometimes yield very powerful spells.

--------
Archmage
--------

HP- 3000
Exp- 48000
Zenny- 2000
Steal Item- Soul Gem
Drop Item- Holy Avenger (100% assured)
Location- Container Yard
Abilities- Benediction, Blizzard, Mind Sword, Myollnir

Notes- See the Challenge Monsters section (Ctrl+F Challenge Monsters)

-----
Armor
-----

HP- 275
Exp- 1220
Zenny- 100
Steal Item- Claymore
Drop Item- Gideon's Garb
Location- Myria Station
Abilities- Frost Strike, Risky Blow

Notes- These guys are unique in that they have a special kind of armor
which greatly reduces the damage they take from physical attacks (hence
the name Armor). However, this armor can be "cracked" if you hit the
Armor with a few physical attacks. Once this happens, they will be very
vulnerable to physical attacks. The main attack that you have to worry
about from them is Frost Strike, which can do a good deal of damage and
induce sleep. Equip your weaker characters with Rings of Ice and Dream
Rings to reduce casualties. It also might be worth it to cast Charm on
these guys before you kill them in hopes of getting that Gideon's Garb
armor for Garr.

---------
Armor Bot
---------

HP- 65
Exp- 45
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Breastplate
Drop Item- Marbles
Location- Momo's Tower
Abilities- Charge

Notes- The Armor Bot is similar to the Proto Bot except they have
higher defense. Use electric spells like Jolt to not only inflict a
very good amount of damage to them, but also confuse them as well.

--------
Assassin
--------

HP- 145
Exp- 225
Zenny- 380
Steal Item- Lgt. Clothing
Drop Item- Katzbalger
Location- Steel Grave, Colony
Abilities- Disembowel, Target

Notes- This cousin of the Tricker can be both annoying and deadly,
especially while fighting them in groups or among a few other enemies.
They are pretty fast and like to use Disembowel A LOT. This attack
itself is nonlethal, however it brings the victim down to one HP, which
makes it very easy for other enemies to finish that character off if
you can't heal quickly enough. The good thing is that their HP isn't
all that high, so your strongest melee skills should be able to take
them out in one hit. Just remeber to give anyone who gets hit by
Disembowel immediate attention, even if it's after the battle.

------
Audrey
------

HP- 175
Exp- 330
Zenny- 110
Steal Item- Green Apple
Drop Item- Mandrake
Location- Steel Grave
Abilities- Devour, Pollen

Notes- Nothing too special here. Just pound these guys with physical
attacks before they get a chance to blind your party with Pollen. Bat
Amulets and UV Glasses will prevent Pollen from taking any effect.

---------
Barb Bulb
---------

HP- 155
Exp- 125
Zenny- 110
Steal Item- Croc Tear
Drop Item- Ginseng
Location- Tidal Caves
Abilities- Seroids

Notes- Barb Bulbs have a very passive and sometimes annoying fighting
style. They will usually cast Steroids on their first turn to increase
their attack power and then let their very high reprisal rate do the
rest. Rely on powerful physical blows or electric spells to defeat them
effectively. Kill them using as few hits as possible to reduce the
damage you take from their reprisals.

---
Bat
---

HP- 6
Exp- 8
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- None
Location- Mt. Glaus Caverns, McNeil Manor Roof
Abilities- Gloom

Notes- A very easy enemy to defeat. They'll either defend or hit you
with weak physical attacks. Your regular attacks will be able to take
them out in one hit. However, if you manage to damage a Bat without
killing it, it will cast Gloom.

---------
Berserker
---------

HP- 15000
Exp- 30000
Zenny- 3000
Steal Item- Aries Gloves
Drop Item- Rufad's Spear
Location- Container Yard
Abilities- Berserk, Fire Whip

Notes- See the Challenge Monsters section (Ctrl+F Challenge Monsters)

--------
Big Bulb
--------

HP- 110
Exp- 100
Zenny- 75
Steal Item- Mandrake
Drop Item- Life Shard
Location- Underground Laboratory
Abilities- Pollen

Notes- The first thing that should be noted about the Big Bulb is that
they regenerate 55 HP every turn. They also seem to get stronger either
as the battle goes on or the more you use magic on them. Your regular
attacks should suffice against them. Just make sure you do more damage
than they regenerate.

---------
Blood Bat
---------

HP- 35
Exp- 55
Zenny- 30
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- None
Location- Lighthouse
Abilities- Syphon

Notes- Blood Bats are generally annoying, because they'll usually suck
away your health with Syphon on the first turn and then run away.
They're also very hard to hit with physical attacks. Use spells that
attack all enemies, such as Typhoon, to kill them quickly.

-----------
Blue Goblin
-----------

HP- 120
Exp- 95
Zenny- 75
Steal Item- Beef Jerky
Drop Item- Scramasax
Location- Mt. Levett
Abilities- Jolt

Notes- It's one of the more powerful members of the Goblin family, but
still not much of a threat. Their Jolt spell can cause noticable
damage, but that's about it. Also, these guys will will follow orders
from Boss Goblins if they are present. Just kill them off with regular
attacks.

----
Bolt
----

HP- 10
Exp- 160
Zenny- 85
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Royal Dagger
Location- Steel Beach, Black Ship, Relay Point A
Abilities- Frost Strike

Notes- Like all of the bolt-type enemies, these guys are annoying to
fight. They're extremely hard to hit will physical attacks, so rely on
level 2 or 3 magic spells to defeat them. Also consider equipping your
weakest characters with Rings of Ice and Dream Rings to negate the
effects of Frost Strike.

-----------
Bolt Archer
-----------

HP- 10
Exp- 190
Zenny- 100
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Panacea
Location- Steel Beach, Black Ship, Relay Point A
Abilities- Blind, Lucky Strike

Notes- Bolt Archers are quite fast, and they can cause a lot of damage
due to their frequent Lucky Strikes. Like with all of the Bolts, you'll
have a very tough time hitting them with regular attacks, so use your
stronger magic spells to kill them.

---------
Bolt Lord
---------

HP- 20
Exp- 320
Zenny- 550
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Lacquer Helm
Location- Black Ship
Abilities- Heal

Notes- This is the game's most rarely encountered enemy. Even though
they are extremely rare, they are not all that special while you're
fighting them. If there are other Bolts in the battle with him, the
Bolt Lord will use regular attacks on your party and cast Heal on his
comrades. However, once the Bolt Lord is all by itself, it will panic
and heal your party. With this in mind, kill off all the other enemies
in the battle first, let the Bolt Lord heal you, and them finish it off
with regular attacks (you'll land a hit sooner or later).

---------
Bolt Mage
---------

HP- 10
Exp- 185
Zenny- 180
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Robe of Wind
Location- Steel Beach, Black Ship, Relay Point A
Ablities- Iceblast, Jolt, Silence

Notes- Unlike its Nut-type counter part, the Bolt Mage is fairly
powerful. Occasionally they will cast Silence on the first turn to
prevent you from using magic, which is your prime weapon against Bolts.
Also, their attacks spells can do a good amount of damage. Since it is
very hard to land hits with physical attacks, try eliminating them
quickly with magic.

------
Bomber
------

HP- 100
Exp- 102
Zenny- 45
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Ivory Dice
Location- Dump, Lighthouse
Abilities- Air Raid

Notes- Bombers can be fairly hard when your first encounter them at the
Dump, but are much less of a threat when you meet them again in the
Rhapala region. Like all the Bomb-type enemies, these guys have high
defense. Also, their Air Raid attack can cancel out your turns. Have
your physically stronger characters use their regular attacks, while
more magically inclined characters cast wind-based spells like Cyclone
and Typhoon.

---------
Bomb Seed
---------

HP- 250
Exp- 212
Zenny- 150
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Ivory Dice
Location- Tidal Caves
Abilities- Sacrifice

Notes- These guys will most likely defend until you manage to inflict
a good amount of damage to them, at which time they'll get angry and
cast Sacrifice, a suicidal attack which randomly brings all of your
party members' HP down to 1. With this in mind, make sure you eliminate
all the other enemies in the battle before going after the Bomb Seed.
Once the Bomb Seed is alone, try to kill it before it can use
Sacrifice.

-----------
Boss Goblin
-----------

HP- 25
Exp- 12
Zenny- 8
Steal Item- Waistcloth
Drop Item- Brass Helm
Location- Cedar Woods, Outside McNeil Manor, Mt. Levett, Factory
Abilites- Influence

Notes- Like its name suggests, the Boss Goblin will use the Influence
skill to command the other Goblins (which will usually appear along
with it) to attack a specific character. The only Goblin who will not
take orders from the Boss Goblin is the powerful Hobgoblin, which will
actually attack the Boss if it casts Influence. If caught alone, the
Boss Goblin will flee. While fighting them early in the game, have Rei
try to steal Waistcloths off of them while Ryu and Teepo try to learn
Influence. Kill off the Boss first, then go after the other enemies.

-----
Cacti
-----

HP- 160
Exp- 510
Zenny- 210
Steal Item- Croc Tear
Drop Item- Ginseng
Location- Desert of Death
Abilities- Pollen

Notes- These guys are somewhat passive fighters, as they let their high
reprisal rate do most of the work and occasionally pester your party
with the Pollen spell. However, since their HP is quite low, they won't
last long against you. Take them out with physical attacks or ice based
spells like Blizzard.

-------
Cerebus
-------

HP- 65
Exp- 72
Zenny- 45
Steal Item- Beef Jerky
Drop Item- Vitamins
Location- Angel Tower
Abilities- Howling

Notes- The main thing you have to fret about while fighting the Cerebus
is its Howling ability, which can induce confusion to all of your party
members. Wear some equipment that may offer some protection against
confusion, such as Life Sandals, and just hack away with your regular
attacks. With the exception of Howling, these guys are pretty easy to
beat.

-----
Clone
-----

HP- 90
Exp- 320
Zenny- 255
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Bell Collar
Location- Myria Station Laboratory
Abilities- Blind, Flame Strike

Notes- Although probably one of the weakest enemies you'll fight in
Myria Station, the Clone is much stronger than its Lizard counter part.
Equip Rings of Fire (which can be stolen off of the powerful Red Drakes
in the same area) to absorb the damage from Flame Strike. Regular
attacks will suffice in defeating them.

------
Codger
------

HP- 225
Exp- 380
Zenny- 230
Steal Item- Rare Book
Drop Item- Skill Ink
Location- Colony, Relay Point A
Abilities- Bad Back, Flying Kick, Magic Shuffle

Notes- The Codger can vary in difficulty depending on which abilities
it decides to use. Magic Shuffle can sometimes produce some very nasty
spells, so be cautious. However, you'll luck out if he uses Bad Back,
which does absolutely nothing at all. If you're fighting them at Relay
Point A, they'll often come paired with a Tank Bot, who will feed the
Codger AP using Transfer. Just take them out as quickly as you can
using regular attacks.

----
Curr
----

HP- 23
Exp- 7
Zenny- 4
Steal Item- Antidote
Drop Item- None
Location- Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus Caverns
Abilities- Chlorine

Notes- They're more of a pest than a tough enemy, as they like to use
Chlorine to poison you. If Rei is in your party, have him use Pilfer
to snatch the Antidotes they're carrying, so that you can cure any
poison that they may induce during the battle.

---------
Death Bot
---------

HP- 450
Exp- 960
Zenny- 100
Steal Item- Damascus Mail
Drop Item- Atomic Bomb
Location- Myria Station
Abilities- Barrier, Might, Protect, Triple Blow

Notes- Despite their name, Death Bots aren't really too threatening.
They'll spend their first few turns casting assist spells before
proceeding to attack your party with Triple Blow and regular attacks.
So you'll probably be able to take them out long before they begin to
attack, however, it may be worthwhile to let a Death Bot live to attack
at one point or another so you can learn Triple Blow, which is one of
the game's best melee skills. Another thing to take note about is that
they are weak against electric attacks, so spells like Myollnir will do
massive damage.

----------
Dragon Fly
----------

HP- 75
Exp- 250
Zenny- 60
Steal Item- Panacea
Drop Item- None
Location- Relay Point A
Abilities- Snap

Notes- You'll usually find them in small groups along with an Insector
or two. Since the Insector is, by far, the more powerful enemy, take
them out first and then focus on the Dragon Flies. However, once left
alone, they can be prone to run away. Just make sure you pick them off
quickly with regular attacks or a nice spell vs. all.

----
Drak
----

HP- 340
Exp- 850
Zenny- 350
Steal Item- Titan Belt
Drop Item- Mind Shield
Location- Desert of Death
Abilities- Cure, Typhoon

Notes- Every single time you fight one of these guys, they'll be
paralyzed by the desert heat, which completely disables them from
fighting. But if you cure their paralysis with a Panacea or the spell
Remedy, the Drak will be able to attack you. Aside from using normal
attacks, the Drak will occasionally cast Typhoon and the excellent
learnable healing spell, Cure.

------
Doksen
------

HP- ~140
Exp- 46
Zenny- 24
Steal Item- N/A
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Heal

Notes- This is the last ghost sub-boss that you fight while going
through the McNeil Manor with just Ryu and Teepo in your group.
Luckily, they didn't save the best for last, as Doksen is ridiculously
easy. Instead of casting the Heal spell he has on himself, he'll use it
to heal YOU! So just hack away at him with regular attacks while he
heals you until he goes down. And like with all of the ghosts in McNeil
Manor, equiping the Silver Knife will cause you to do a far greater
amount of damage.

--------
Egg Gang
--------

HP- 270
Exp- 560
Zenny- 420
Steal Item- Beads
Drop Item- Ivory Dice
Location- Factory
Abilities- Double Blow, Magic Ball, Ovum

Notes- Egg Gangs can be frustrating to fight mainly because of their
Ovum attack, which induces a unique status change that transforms the
victim into an egg, making them powerless to attack and extremely
vulnerable to enemy attacks. However, there is a way to use Ovum to
your advantage. If a character ends the battle while still in the "egg"
state, all of their HP and AP will be restored, so you can let the Egg
Gangs cast Ovum on you to indirectly heal yourself for free. They'll
usually cast Ovum on the first turn, which can make this even easier.
Just remember not to get in over your head trying to get the free
healing, or you may find yourself in trouble.

--------
Eye Bulb
--------

HP- 60
Exp- 80
Zenny- 42
Steal Item- Mandrake
Drop Item- Vitamins
Location- Dump
Abilities- Rest, Silence

Notes- The main thing that should be noted about the Eye Bulb is that
it regenerates 30 HP per turn. Also, they'll usually cast Silence on
their first turn, so rely on heavy physical attacks from Ryu and Momo
to defeat them. It helps if you put Ryu in the lead of an attack
formaion. Once they've been damaged, they like to cast Rest to restore
a small bit of their HP and AP, so be sure to constantly attack them.

-------
Eye Goo
-------

HP- 12
Exp- 2
Zenny- 4
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Vitamin
Location- Cedar Woods, Yraall Road, Road to Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus, Eden
Abilities- Snooze

Notes- The Eye Goo is first and easiest enemies in the game. All they
can really do is use regular attacks, which don't do very much damage
at all. However, if you use the Blind skill (learned from Rippers) on
them, they'll give you a lot more Exp. Also, if you let them live of
several rounds, they may cast Snooze.

---------
Fire Slug
---------

HP- 61
Exp- 94
Zenny- 50
Steal Item- Panacea
Drop Item- Moxa
Location- Dump, Dauna Mine
Abilities- Firebreath

Notes- The only thing you have to fret about the Fire Slug is its
Firebreath attack, which has the potential to do a lot of damage. The
attack is HP based, so the less HP the Fire Slug has, the less damage
Firebreath will do. So the key to fighting these guys is to deal out as
much damage as you can before they get a chance to attack to greatly
reduce the casualties from Firebreath.

-------
Fly Man
-------

HP- 135
Exp- 160
Zenny- 140
Steal Item- Scale Mail
Drop Item- Flame Spear
Location- Underground Laboratory
Abilities- Firebreath, Flame Strike

Notes- The Fly Man specializes in fire based attacks, so try to equip
a Ring of Fire, Magma Armor, or any other type of equipment that
resists damage from fire. They like to use Firebreath a lot, so cause
damage to them quickly to reduce the effectiveness of Firebreath.
There nothing much else to worry about here except Flame Strike, which
may be worthwhile to learn. Just take them down with normal attacks or
ice magic.

---------
Foul Weed
---------

HP- 680
Exp- 1700
Zenny- 250
Steal Item- Power Food
Drop Item- Protein
Location- Path to Eden (Myria Station)
Abilities- Absorb, Devour

Notes- These guys have quite a lot of HP, but since they start off the
battle asleep, you'll be able to get some good hits in (or possibly
even kill them) before they get a chance to attack. The Foul Weed has
attacks that can drain your HP but that's just about it. They'll
probably take a little longer to kill than the usual random enemy, but
you really shouldn't have any trouble with them.

------
Galtel
------

HP- ~140
Exp- 36
Zenny- 4
Steal Item- N/A
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Blunt, Slow, Weaken

Notes- He is the third of the ghost sub-bosses which you must fight in
McNeil Manor. Overall, he's not too tough, mainly because he spend most
of his time casting stat reduction spells on your party. Just keep
using regular attacks until he dies. Remember that Silver Knives will
cause extra damage, Ryu's Heal spell will also cause some good damage
as well.

-----
Ghost
-----

HP- 65
Exp- 90
Zenny- 80
Steal Item- Wisdom Seed
Drop Item- Buckler
Location- Lighthouse
Abilities- Cyclone, Jolt, Sleep

Notes- These guys are very annoying, mainly because of their Sleep
spell. They usually cast Sleep on the first turn and then proceed to
hit your party with their various level 1 attack spells. The best
thing you can do for yourself here is equip your best attacker, such as
Ryu or Garr, with a Dream Ring or at least Life Sandals to prevent
Sleep from taking effect (you can find a Dream Ring inside the
Lighthouse). They should go down after two or three good hits.

-----
Ghoul
-----

HP- 65
Exp- 22
Zenny- 20
Steal Item- Leather Armor
Drop Item- High Boots
Location- Wyndian Catacombs, Dauna Mine
Abilities- Bone Dart

Notes- The Ghoul is not all that threatening. It can use Bone Dart,
but it only employs it on rare occasions. Like all undead monsters, the
Ghoul can be damaged by healing spells and holy-based attacks. If
you're fighting them in the catacombs, Ryu will mosy likely be able to
kill them in one hit with the Silver Knife equipped.

----------
Giant Crab
----------

HP- 155
Exp- 230
Zenny- 150
Steal Item- Belladonna
Drop Item- Blizzard Mail
Location- Black Ship
Abilities- Death, Double Blow

Notes- You'll find Giant Crabs only in the latter area of the Black
Ship (the path you take to get up to the bow). Although their HP isn't
incredibly high, their defense is. You'll want to try to defeat these
guys quickly because they like to use Death quite often.

---------
Giant Orc
---------

HP- 245
Exp- 480
Zenny- 260
Steal Item- Titan Belt
Drop Item- Tiger's Cap
Location- Factory
Abilities- Blitz, Magic Belt, Protect

Notes- These guys are quite more formidable than their lesser counter
part, the Orc. This is mainly because they regenerate 122 HP per turn,
and like the regular Orcs, they have a fairly high reprisal rate.
Besides relying on their counterattacks to damage you, they'll also
occasionally cast Blitz. To reduce the amount of reprisals that may
potentially be dished out to your group, power up with a move like
Focus before attacking or kill them using non-counterable magic spells.

-----------
Giant Roach
-----------

HP- 150
Exp- 85
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Vitamin
Location- Dauna Mine, Underground Laboratory
Abilities- Douse, Jump

Notes- Giant Roaches will act differently depending on what other kinds
of enemies are present in the battle. Normally, they'll just use Jump,
which usually does miniscule damage. However, if there are enemies in
the battle that use fire based attacks, the Giant Roaches will cast
Douse, which makes the victim very vulnerable to fire. If this is the
case, kill off the fire users first to defeat the purpose of their
Douse spell, then take care of the roaches themselves.

------
Goblin
------

HP- 10
Exp- 2
Zenny- 5
Steal Item- Bent Sword
Drop Item- Old Popper
Location- Cedar Woods, Yraall Road
Abilities- Unmotivate

Notes- These guys are in contention with the Eye Goo as being the
weakest enemy in the game. You'll usually encounter them in small
groups and there will almost always be a Boss Goblin amongst them,
telling the Goblins who to attack by using Influence. Once you kill
off their leader the Boss Goblin, they'll cast Unmotivate, which is
literally a useless yet learnable skill. Just kill them with regular
attacks.

--------
Gold Egg
--------

HP- 500
Exp- 100
Zenny- 20000 (Initially)
Steal Item- Diamond Ring
Drop Item- Divine Helm
Location- Factory
Abilities- Ovum, Resist

Notes- The gold version of the Egg Gang is much more elusive, and as
you can see, can offer an absolutely enormous zenny pay-off. However,
each time you strike them with a physical blow, their zenny value will
drop significantly. Not only that, but the Gold Egg is fast, and it
tends to run away most of the time. If it doesn't flee, it may cast
Resist to nullify all of your attacks. If you encounter one, unleash
your most powerful melee skills to kill it as quickly as possible and
still get a decent reward money-wise. It helps if you have a Chain
formation with a super fast character, such as Rei, in the lead
position.

------
Gonger
------

HP- 70
Exp- 30
Zenny- 27
Steal Item- MultiVitamin
Drop Item- Life Shard
Location- Mt. Boumore, Momo's Tower
Abilities- Venom Breath

Notes- These guys are a bit of a nuisance, mainly because they use
Venom Breath most of the time to induce mass poison on your party.
Equip some Life Sandals to slightly reduce the risk of getting poisoned
and just hit them with your normal attacks. Be sure to cure any poison
you get after the battle using Antidotes.

--------
Gonghead
--------

HP- 31
Exp- 8
Zenny- 10
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Life Shard
Location- Yraall Road, Road to Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus
Abilities- Giant Growth

Notes- These guys are your prime source of Vitamins in the early parts
of the game. Neither their normal attack nor Giant Growth really do
much damage, so just constantly use Rei's Pilfer ability to swipe their
Vitamins (it may take a few tries).

-----
Gooey
-----

HP- 48
Exp- 9
Zenny- 4
Steal Item- Marbles
Drop Item- None
Location- Random Battlefields near McNeil village, Eden
Abilities- Ebonfire

Notes- You'll probably encounter Gooeys very early in the game and
notice that they are in a petrified state (rendering them completely
harmless). If you come back to fight them after you've cleared the
game, they'll no longer be frozen. Not only that, but they will also
be able to cast the spell Ebonfire, which is one of the game's rarest
learnable skills. So consider trying to learn Ebonfire once you've
beaten the game.

--------
Goo King
--------

HP- 1500
Exp- 15000
Zenny- 1000
Steal Item- Green Apple
Drop Item- Goo King Sword
Location- Path to Eden (Myria Station), Eden, Myria Station Final Area
Abilities- Charge, Ragnarok, Sirocco, Tornado

Notes- Like its name suggests, the Goo King is the most powerful of the
goos... and that's an understatement! For the most part, Goo Kings will
just flee whenever you encounter them. However, if you steal their
Green Apple, the Goo King will get angry and extract revenge by pelting
your party with ultra-powerful spells like Ragnarok and Sirocco. An
angry Goo King is not to be taken lightly at any level, so ALWAYS be
cautious. Having Rings of Fire will protect you from its painful
Sirocco spell. Besides the good amount of experience you gain by
slaying one of these powerhouses, there is also another reward to
consider: the Goo King Sword, which is Ryu's best weapon. To increase
you chances of having the Goo King drop its sword, cast Charm and have
one of your characters equipped with a Midas Stone. The chances of
getting the sword are still extremely low, even after doing that, but
if you fight enough of them, you may just get lucky. Getting the Goo
King Sword takes luck, period.

---------
Goo Titan
---------

HP- 350
Exp- 660
Zenny- 200
Steal Item- Life Shard
Drop Item- Protectors
Location- Forest in Eastern Wyndia, Ogre Road, Mt. Levett, Eden
Abilities- Burn, Timed Blow

Notes- Goo Titans are considerably powerful when you meet them as an
adult, and can be extremely tough if you pick a fight with them during
childhood. Their Burn spell does a light amount of damage, and Timed
Blow can obviously be devastating if the Goo Titan is near full HP.
However, they seem to rarely use Timed Blow unless you're fighting
them in Eden. Equip a Ring of Fire to absorb their Burn attack and hit
them with regular attacks or melee skills. Goo Titans are also a great
source of Life Shards, so try stealing from them whenever you get the
chance.

-----
Guard
-----

HP- ~50
Exp- 12
Zenny- 24
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Iron Helm
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- None

Notes- The Guard is probably the most resilient enemy in McNeil Manor
because they like to use Healing Herbs on themselves when they get low
on HP. Just keep attacking them until they go down (I believe they can
only use one Healing Herb each).

---------
Hobgoblin
---------

HP- 380
Exp- 800
Zenny- 300
Steal Item- Power Food
Drop Item- None
Location- Factory
Abilities- Intimidate, Spirit Blast

Notes- These guys are the most powerful members of the goblin clan...
so much that they are the only goblins that won't submit to the orders
of the Boss Goblin. You'll usually fight them along with a Boss Goblin
or another of its kind. If a Boss Goblin is present in the battle and
casts Infulence (which it will unless you kill it first), the Hobgoblin
will defiantly murder the Boss. The Hobgoblin's attacks can do a good
amount of damage so make sure to keep an eye on your HP, especially if
you are using a formation that lowers defense (such as the Chain
formation). Normal attacks should suffice for defeating them. Also,
try to steal from them if you get the chance, because these guys are
an excellent way to get Power Foods.

------
Hopper
------

HP- 175
Exp- 380
Zenny- 120
Steal Item- Fat Frog
Drop Item- Balance Ring
Location- Myria Station Laboratory
Abilities- Air Raid, Hypnotize

Notes- The major thing you have to worry about with these guys is their
Hypnotize spell, which induces confusion. Simply equip a Balance Ring,
Ivory Charm, or a Light Bangle to nullify the attack. Also, their Air
Raid attack can cause some good damage, as well as cancel your turn.
Either kill them with regular attacks, or hit them with electriciy to
take them down quickly.

---------
Hyper Bot
---------

HP- 64
Exp- 120
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Cuirass
Drop Item- Ginseng
Location- Momo's Tower
Abilities- Blitz

Notes- Unlike most of the other robot-type enemies you'll encounter in
the game, the Hyper Bot is immune to electricity. Its Blitz attack can
deal a lot of damage, so make sure to keep your HP up before entering
battles. However, once the Hyper Bot uses Blitz, its HP will be cut in
half, which should allow you to kill it off quickly.

---------
Ice Drake
---------

HP- 350
Exp- 2050
Zenny- 250
Steal Item- Ring of Ice
Drop Item- Dragonfang
Location- Myria Station Laboratory
Abilities- Frost Breath, Howling

Notes- These guys, along with their flame-type clones, are quite
powerful. Not only will they use Howling to confuse you, but their
Frost Breath attack can deal huge damage if used at full HP. Be sure
to equip some accessory, such as a Balance Ring, to ward off the
confusion from Howling. The key here is to damage the Ice Drake
quickly, because the less HP it has, the less effective its Frost
Breath will be. Obviously, they are most vulnerable to fire-based
attacks. If you are fighting them for the first time, be sure to swipe
their Ring of Ice, so that next time you fight them, you'll have some
good protection against Frost Breath.

--------
Ice Toad
--------

HP- 80
Exp- 63
Zenny- 45
Steal Item- Life Shard
Drop Item- Soul Gem
Location- Momo's Tower
Abilities- Icebreath

Notes- These guys aren't all too tough as long as you can damage them
quickly. Like most breath attacks, their Ice Breath does damage based
on how much HP they have. The more HP they have, the more damage the
attack will do, and likewise, the attack will do a lot less damage when
their HP gets low. Fire-based attacks are super effective against them,
so have Nina use Simoon, while Momo attacks with Flame Chrysm equipped.
The Ring of Ice that you can win from the crystal puzzle at the
beginning of the Tower will also be of great help against them.

--------
Insector
--------

HP- 275
Exp- 520
Zenny- 220
Steal Item- Beef Jerky
Drop Item- Gale Javelin
Location- Relay Point A
Abilities- Tornado, Typhoon

Notes- As you can see, the Insector specializes in wind attacks. While
Typhoon only does a moderate amount of damage, Tornado is always
threatening, because it randomly drops all fighters' HP down to 1.
With this in mind, you won't want to mess around with them for very
long. Just defeat them using normal attacks or some good level 2 or 3
spells.

------
Kassen
------

HP- ~65
Exp- 38
Zenny- 20
Steal Item- N/A
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Drain, Leech Power

Notes- Kassen is the second ghost sub-boss that you fight while going
through McNeil Manor. He specializes in attacks that sap away your HP
and AP, which can be quite annoying. However, Kassen shouldn't last
long, as his HP is pretty low. Just hit him with normal attacks and
Ryu's Heal spell until he goes down. Remember that having a Silver
Knife equipped will allow you to do some major damage.

---------
King Toad
---------

HP- 210
Exp- 280
Zenny- 150
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Life Shard
Location- Black Ship
Abilities- Icebreath, Influence

Notes- These guys are kind of unique in that they are the only other
enemy in the game besides the Boss Goblin that can cast Influence.
They'll usually only use Influence if there are some Sleepys in the
battle along with it. Otherwise, the King Toad will most likely use
Icebreath, which can inflict a good amount of damage. Equip a Ring of
Ice and other armor that resists frost-based attacks, such as the
Blizzard Mail. If you don't have a lot of frost protection handy,
you'll want to cause a lot of damage to the King Toad as quickly as
you can to reduce the effectiveness of its Icebreath.

--------
Lava Man
--------

HP- 113
Exp- 90
Zenny- 75
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Firecracker
Location- Mt. Zublo
Abilities- Fireblast, Flare, Inferno

Notes- Lava Men aren't too hard to cope with when fighting them
normally. Just put on some equipment that protects against fire-based
attacks, such as a Ring of Fire, Asbestos Armor, or Magma Armor. Then
hit them with regular attacks or anything ice-based (Momo's Ice Chrysm
works extremely well here). However, if you want some more experience
points, you can use fire-based attacks on them to power them up and
increase th amount of Exp they give. Each time you use fire on them,
their Exp will increase, however, they will also get a lot stronger.
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN RAISING THEIR EXP! The Lava Man will start to get
extremely powerful after just 2-3 charges.

------
Lizard
------

HP- 45
Exp- 28
Zenny- 25
Steal Item- Panacea
Drop Item- None
Location- Momo's Tower, Mt. Zublo
Abilities- Blind

Notes- Lizards can be particularly annoying, because they will always
target the character with the lowest HP. This can spell big trouble for
some of your physically weaker characters, like Nina and Momo, in the
earlier parts of the game. But since you'll usually encounter them in
small groups, you can ues the Influence spell (learned from Boss
Goblins) to command the Lizards to attack their allies. Otherwise their
low HP make them easy to kill with Ryu's physical attacks.

----------
Lizard Man
----------

HP- 128
Exp- 160
Zenny- 102
Steal Item- Broad Sword
Drop Item- Flame Shield
Location- Mt. Zublo, Angel Tower
Abilities- Rejuvenate, Shield, Wind Strike

Notes- The Lizard Man is to be noted most for its ridiculously high
reprisal rate, which will end up causing the most damage. You'll
usually find them amongst a small group of lesser Lizards. They will
most always cast Shield on their first turn before proceeding to hit
you with regular attacks, as well as the occasional Wind Strike. Try
to defeat it using as few hits as possible, by employing power-up
skills like Focus, to reduce the amount of blows you take from
reprisals. Don't even bother to attack with your physically weaker
characters, such as Nina, unless you're going to use uncounterable
magic spells.

--------
Mad Gong
--------

HP- 230
Exp- 850
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Ginseng
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Ryu's Dream
Abilities- Charge

Notes- You'll be fighting these guys with just Ryu in your party, but
there's really nothing to worry about here. They'll use Charge most of
the time, which doesn't do very much damage at all. Just hit them with
with a few regular attacks to kill them.

--------
Mage Goo
--------

HP- 22
Exp- 6
Zenny- 20
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Wisdom Seed
Location- Cedar Woods, Yraall Road, Road to Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus, Eden
Abilities- Burn

Notes- Probably one of the more powerful goo enemies that you'll
encounter at the very beginning of the game, but the Mage Goo still
isn't all that tough. Their Burn attack can cause a decent amount of
damage, and that's about it. It would be a very good idea to have Ryu
learn Burn from them to use later on against the nut people you'll
have to fight.

--------
Magmaite
--------

HP- 400
Exp- 1300
Zenny- 300
Steal Item- Napalm
Drop Item- Royal Armor
Location- Desert of Death
Abilities- Air Raid, Flying Kick, Lavaburst

Notes- These guys are much stronger than their cousin back at
Mt. Zublo, the Vulcan, and apparently more agile as well. The
Magmaite's Air Raid and Flying Kick attacks do a lot of damage, not to
mention they also have very high defense. They can also use Lavaburst,
but they don't employ it very often. The best way to kill them is to
just chip away using strong melee skills like Shadowwalk. However, if
you have Momo in your party, you can use her Quake spell to deal a
bunch of damage.

--------
Man Trap
--------

HP- 45
Exp- 24
Zenny- 40
Steal Item- Pointed Stick
Drop Item- Panacea
Location- Road to Mt. Glaus
Abilities- Devour, Dream Breath

Notes- The Man Trap can be quite a powerful enemy at the very beginning
of the game. They start the battle off asleep, so take advantage of
this free turn by killing them before they get an opportunity to
attack. However, once you wake them up, they'll use Dream Breath to
put you to sleep and then proceed to sap away your HP with Devour. Ryu
and Rei should hit the Man Trap with regular attacks, while Teepo casts
Flare.

--------
Mist Man
--------

HP- 450
Exp- 5200
Zenny- 400
Steal Item- Seeking Sword
Drop Item- Mist Armor
Location- Myria Station Final Area
Abilities- Thunder Strike

Notes- There's no denying that the Mist Man is quite a formidable foe.
The biggest threat from them is their Thunder Strike attack, which can
paralyze your characters. It helps if you equip your weakest character
(or the character at the front of your formation) with a Thunder Ring.
Also, like its close relative the Armor, the Mist Man has a special
armor that makes its defense ultra-high until the armor is cracked.
The break the armor, you must hit the Mist Man with a few physical
attacks. Either destroy them with some powerful level 3 magic spells
like Myollnir, or break through their armor and take them down with
physical attacks. Strong melee skills like Shadowwalk are also
effective here.

---------
Multi Bot
---------

HP- 115
Exp- 300
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Silver Mail
Drop Item- Barrier Ring
Location- Steel Grave
Abilities- Iceblast, Rejuvenate, Thunder Clap, Wall of Fire

Notes- The Multi Bot is a very unique enemy, because it will use
different attacks depending on what kind of attacks you use on it. If
you use ice-based, fire-based, or electric-based attacks, the Multi Bot
will retaliate with Iceblast, Wall of Fire, and Thunder Clap
respectively. If you just use regular attacks, the Multi Bot will
defend and let its extremely high reprisal rate do all the work. Also,
if you use a healing spell on the Multi Bot, it'll actually start
casting Rejuvenate on your party. Just power up with a move like Focus
to defeat them with as little hits as possible.

----
Newt
----

HP- 250
Exp- 1550
Zenny- 350
Steal Item- Heat Shotel
Drop Item- Mind Shield
Location- Myria Station Laboratory
Abilities- Mighty Chop, Shield, Simoon

Notes- A slightly upgraded version of the Lizard Man, but without the
ridiculous reprisal rate. The Newt's Mighty Chop skill does miniscule
damage, while its Simoon spell can prove to be a little more injurious.
Equip Rings of Fire to negate Simoon completely and just defeat them
using normal attacks.

---------
Night Bat
---------

HP- 75
Exp- 350
Zenny- 58
Steal Item- Power Food
Drop Item- Protein
Location- Myria Station Final Area
Abilities- Gloom

Notes- Although the Night Bats are probably the weakest of all the
enemies in the final area of the game, they are still not to be taken
too lightly. Their normal attacks can do quite a bit of damage, and
they'll often cast Gloom to make your party members undead. Becareful
if this happens, because in the undead state, healing spells will HURT
you. Just take them out with normal attacks or a decent group-affect
spell. If you find these guys in a battle with a Vampire, be sure to
kill them first before going after the Vampire. Also, while Night Bats
offer minimum Exp, fighting them is a great way to obtain mass amounts
of Power Foods.

--------
Nitemare
--------

HP- 215
Exp- 850
Zenny- 220
Steal Item- Hawk's Ring
Drop Item- Burglar Garb
Location- Myria Station
Abilities- Magic Ball, Sleep, Syphon

Notes- These guys can be very annoying, as they almost always cast
Sleep on the first turn before proceeding to attack your party with
Syphon and Magic Ball. So be sure to equip your party with Dream Rings.
Luckily, they are extremely weak against holy-type attacks, so skills
such as Demonbane, Holy Strike, and Kyrie will constitute one hit
kills. Weapons with a holy property, such as the Ascension, Holy
Avenger, and Rufad's Spear will also get the job done nicely.

----------
Nut Archer
----------

HP- 5
Exp- 25
Zenny- 14
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Panacea
Location- Mt. Boumore
Abilities- Lucky Strike

Notes- These guys are probably the most annoying members of the nut
family, due to their high agility and frequent critical hits. Like all
of the nut people, the Nut Archer is extremely evasive, so don't bother
trying to hit them with normal attacks. Use a simple spell like Burn or
use a Molotov to kill them easily.

--------
Nut Mage
--------

HP- 5
Exp- 17
Zenny- 18
Steal Item- Molotov
Drop Item- Berries
Location- Mt. Myrneg, Wyndian Catacombs, Eygnock Road, Mt. Boumore
Abilities- Flare

Notes- Nut Mages are probably the weakest of the nut people, because
they're pretty slow, and their Flare spell only causes a light amount
of damage. However, the item situation for the Nut Mage is very unique.
If you defeat the Nut Mage before it can use Flare (which they will
always use on the first turn), then they are 100% assured to drop their
Molotov. This allows you to kill them using your own Molotovs for free.

---------
Nut Troop
---------

HP- 5
Exp- 15
Zenny- 16
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Broad Sword
Location- Mt. Myrneg, Wyndian Catacombs, Eygnock Road, Mt. Boumore
Abilities- Double Blow

Notes- The Nut Troop isn't too much of a threat. Like all of its kind,
they are very hard to hit with physical attacks, so use weak spells
such as Burn to kill them. Also, it would be a very good idea to learn
Double Blow from them early on in the game, as it is a very useful
skill.

---
Orc
---

HP- 100
Exp- 58
Zenny- 62
Steal Item- Bronze Shield
Drop Item- Titan Belt
Location- Mt. Boumore (back side), Momo's Tower
Abilities- Last Resort

Notes- Orcs are most notable for their extremely high reprisal rate and
their trademark Last Resort spell, which will sacrifice all of the
Orc's defense to increase their attack power. Have Nina refrain from
using physical attacks, and instead use spells like Blunt or Weaken on
the Orc, while Ryu and Momo attack. It may prove useful to have an
attack formation with Ryu in the lead, so that he can deal a bunch of
damage, especially after they use Last Resort. Also, at some point in
time, you should consider learning Last Resort to give to one of your
tank characters later in the game.

---------
Pain Weed
---------

HP- 80
Exp- 57
Zenny- 40
Steal Item- Bat Amulet
Drop Item- None
Location- Dump
Abilities- None

Notes- Although it's very easy to get the Pain Weed confused with its
close relative the Rank Weed, there is a very distinct difference
between them. The Pain Weed absorbs magic attacks as HP, so you must
defeat them using physical attacks. And since you'll almost always
find Pain Weeds and Rank Weeds together in battle, make sure you don't
mix up the two and accidentally attack the Pain Weed with magic.

-------
Phantom
-------

HP- 140
Exp- 115
Zenny- 200
Steal Item- Belladonna
Drop Item- Crepe Cape
Location- Angel Tower
Abilities- Death

Notes- You're really going to want to kill these guys quickly, because
the like to use Death a lot. Equip your most valued attackers with a
Talisman or Diamond Ring to ward off Death, and proceed to kill them
using normal attacks. And remember, since the Phantom is an undead
enemy, holy-based attacks (such as Ryu's Silver Knife) and healing
spells will damage them.

---------
Pipe Bomb
---------

HP- 145
Exp- 495
Zenny- 180
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- Ivory Dice
Location- Factory
Abilities- Air Raid, Protect, Sacrifice

Notes- While the Pipe Bombs don't have very much HP, they make up for
it with their extremely high defense, which they'll reinforce even
further by casting Protect. Try to take them down one at a time,
because they like to use Sacrifice when they get low on HP. Powerful
melee skills like Shadowwalk may be able to kill them in one hit. They
also have a slight weakness towards electricity, so Myollnir should
yield a one hit kill as well.

--------
Plant 42
--------

HP- 220
Exp- 1200
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Mandrake
Drop Item- Vitamins
Location- Path to Eden (Myria Station)
Abilities- Snap

Notes- Despite their unique name, there's nothing really unique about
the Plant 42. Their normal attack does a light amount of damage, while
Snap just does a pathetic amount of damage. They also tend to attack
Foul Weeds if they are present in the battle. Just use normal attacks
to kill them. Momo's HE Shells should take them out in one hit.

-----
Pooch
-----

HP- ~270
Exp- 57
Zenny- 10
Steal Item- Vitamin
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Outside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Snap

Notes- Pooch is the first of the many sub-bosses you fight durning the
McNeil Manor mission. Just have Ryu and Teepo use regular attacks while
Rei uses Pilfer to snatch that Vitamin. It will take quite a few
rounds, but you should be able to defeat Pooch without much trouble.

---------
Proto Bot
---------

HP- 65
Exp- 30
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Marbles
Drop Item- Cuirass
Location- Momo's Tower
Abilities- None

Notes- The Proto Bot is the easiest of the three robot-type enemies
you'll fight in the Tower. There's really nothing to worry about here,
as their regular attacks don't do very much damage. Just have Ryu and
Momo use normal attacks. Nina's Jolt spell will do quite a bit of
damage, as well as induce confusion.

--------
Puff Goo
--------

HP- 21
Exp- 15
Zenny- 7
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- Vitamin
Location- Road to Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus
Abilities- None

Notes- Most of the time, Puff Goos will simply defend and let their
fairly high reprisal rate do the attacking for them, while occasionally
using normal attacks. Simply use your regular attacks to beat them. If
Rei is in your party, have him use Pilfer to pick up some extra Healing
Herbs.

---------
Rank Weed
---------

HP- 80
Exp- 57
Zenny- 40
Steal Item- Bat Amulet
Drop Item- None
Location- Dump
Abilities- Weaken

Notes- While the almost identical Pain Weed absorbs magical attacks,
the Rank Weed is very weak against magic. While Ryu and Momo pound on
the Pain Weed (which usually appears in the battle with the Rank Weed),
Nina should attack the Rank Weed with magic. Just mkae sure not to
confuse the Rank Weed and the Pain Weed. They look VERY similar to each
other, so make sure you know which one you're attacking.

------
Reaper
------

HP- 240
Exp- 420
Zenny- 270
Steal Item- Magic Shard
Drop Item- Phantom Dress
Location- Relay Point A
Abilities- Focus, Multi Strike

Notes- Reapers are undead creatures, so any holy-based attacks or
healing spells will do a lot of damage to them. They'll usually use
Focus on the first turn and then hit you with Multi Strike, which
doesn't even do very much damage. However, both Focus and Multi Strike
are learnable skills. Also, fighting Reapers is a great way to
accumulate massive amounts of Magic Shards. Be sure to cast Charm on
them to make steal those Magic Shards easier.

---------
Red Drake
---------

HP- 350
Exp- 2050
Zenny- 250
Steal Item- Ring of Fire
Drop Item- Dragonfang
Location- Myria Station Laboratory
Abilities- Flame Breath, Howling

Notes- Red Drakes and their frost-type counterparts can be tough to
cope with. Their Flame Breath attack does a lot of damage when their HP
is high, and they can induce mass confusion with Howling. Equip as many
people as you can with Balance Rings to prevent the confusion, and
quickly deal out as much damage as you can. Since Flame Breath is
HP-based, if the Red Drake has low HP, Flame Breath won't do nearly as
much damage. Since they have an affinity for fire, use forst-based
attacks to deal out major damage. You may also want to snatch their
Ring of Fire the first few times you fight them, so that in future
battles, you'll have complete protection against their deadly Flame
Breath attack.

--------
Revenant
--------

HP- 290
Exp- 1500
Zenny- 500
Steal Item- Belladonna
Drop Item- Diana's Dress
Location- Myria Station Final Area
Abilities- Chill, Lucky Strike, Multistrike

Notes- Compared to some of the other enemies you have to fight in the
game's final area, the Revenant isn't all too tough. Their Chill spell
causes some decent frost damage and can lower the agility of your
entire party. Multi Strike can also take off a good amount of HP if
they get enough hits with it. Equip Rings of Ice to protect yourself
from Chill, and pound them with holy-based attacks such as Holy Strike
and Demonbane, or use holy-property weapons like the Holy Avenger. They
tend to come in small groups, so Kyrie can also prove to be extremely
useful against them.

------
Ripper
------

HP- 20
Exp- 7
Zenny- 5
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Swallow Eye
Location- Cedar Woods, Yraall Road, Road to Mt. Glaus, Mt. Glaus,
          Mt. Myrneg, Eygnock Road
Abilities- Blind

Notes- Rippers can be slightly annoying in the very early stages of the
game, mainly because they're pretty fast and like to use Blind. Just
use your normal attacks to kill them, and be sure to learn Blind at
one point or another, as it will prove useful in raising the Exp of
Eye Goos.

-----
Roach
-----

HP- ~65
Exp- 10
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Healing Herb
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Jump

Notes- These guys are probably the hardest enemies inside the manor,
because they can appear in large groups, and their Jump attack has the
potential to cause a lot of damage. If you're trying to conserve AP,
try just using regular attacks on them, but if you get into trouble,
start employing Teepo's Simoon spell.

-----
Rocky
-----

HP- ~270
Exp- 87
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Life Shard
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Outside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Jump, Ovum

Notes- Rocky is probably one of the tougher sub-bosses you'll fight
during the McNeil Manor mission. This is mainly due to his Ovum spell,
which turns the victim into an egg and renders that character helpless.
His Jump attack can potentially take off quite a bit of damage as well.
Have Ryu use normal attacks and Healing Herbs when necessary, while Rei
uses Pilfer and Teepo casts Simoon. It should take quite a few turns
to take Rocky down.

--------
Scorpion
--------

HP- 185
Exp- 620
Zenny- 320
Steal Item- Antidote
Drop Item- Protein
Location- Desert of Death
Abilities- Chlorine, Double Blow, Tornado

Notes- Scorpions are one of the more solid enemies that you fight in
the desert, but they're still not too tough. They'll usually just use
light attacks like Chlorine and Double Blow, but keep in mind that they
are also capable of casting the devastating Tornado spell. Their main
weakness is electricity, so spells like Lightning or electric based
weapons such as the Barbarossa and Royal Sword work well here.

-------
Slasher
-------

HP- 98
Exp- 95
Zenny- 70
Steal Item- Berries
Drop Item- Swallow Eye
Location- Ogre Road, Mt. Levett, Tidal Caves
Abilities- Mind Flay

Notes- Slashers are fast and like to pester your most intelligent
characters with Mind Flay, which does miniscule damage but also reduces
intelligence. There's really nothing to fear here, however, because
they are easily taken out with normal attacks. They have a weakness
towards wind attacks, so Ryu or Rei can defeat them with ease using
the Feather Sword. The Typhoon spell is also very effective here.

------
Sleepy
------

HP- 120
Exp- 95
Zenny- 66
Steal Item- Baby Frog
Drop Item- Fat Frog
Location- Tidal Caves, Black Ship
Abilities- Hypnotize, Snooze

Notes- Sleepys are typical nuisance fighters. Their own attacks won't
do much damage, but they often cast Hypnotize to confuse your party
members. Equip status protection accessories such as Balance Rings or
Life Sandals to help prevent confusion from occurring. Either beaten
them down with regular attacks or exploit their weakness towards
electricity by casting spells like Lightning.

----
Slug
----

HP- 47
Exp- 35
Zenny- 20
Steal Item- None
Drop Item- None
Location- Dump, Dauna Mine
Abilities- Chlorine

Notes- These guys are pretty weak, but their Chlorine attack (which
they use quite often) can be annoying. They usually come in small
groups, which often contain one or two Fire Slugs as well. Since the
Fire Slugs are much more of a threat, take care of them first and then
go after the lesser Slugs with regular attacks.

-------
Spectre
-------

HP- 30
Exp- 150
Zenny- 75
Steal Item- Wisdom Seed
Drop Item- Barrier Ring
Location- Lighthouse, Angel Tower
Abilities- Depress, Leech Power

Notes- Spectres are among the few extremely annoying enemies that
prefer to make direct attacks on your AP instead of your HP. They'll
usually cast Depress on the first turn, which saps AP from all of your
party members, and follow up with Leech Power, another spell that
steals AP. Especially if you are making your way through the
Lighthouse, you'll want to protect your precious AP, so exterminate
Spectres with extreme prejudice. Kill them as quickly as you can with
physical attacks. It helps if you have a somewhat fast attacker, such
as Ryu, at the front of an attack formation.

------
Spiker
------

HP- 250
Exp- 240
Zenny- 125
Steal Item- Antidote
Drop Item- Soul Gem
Location- Tidal Caves
Abilities- Giant Growth, Rejuvenate, Venom Breath

Notes- These guys have a very solid amount of HP, so it's going to take
a few good hits to bring them down. But, the annoying part about just
using normal attacks is that the Spiker has a very high reprisal rate.
However, the Spiker is most annoying because of its Venom Breath
attack, which poisons all of your party members. Also, they like to
cast Rejuvenate to heal themselves after taking heavy damage. Use
strong melee skills or electric spells to kill them quickly.
Personally, I find that using Rei's Weretiger coupled with Infulence
is a very effective way of taking them down quickly with no AP cost.

--------
Tank Bot
--------

HP- 275
Exp- 500
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Wisdom Seed
Drop Item- Wisdom Fruit
Location- Relay Point A, Container Yard, Myria Station
Abilities- Sacrifice, Transfer, Vitalize

Notes- Tank Bots are the only enemy in the game that can use the unique
(and learnable) Transfer spell, which they'll often use to feed AP to
their allies. They sometimes may even pointlessly cast Transfer on
themselves. If you catch them by themselves or bring them down to low
HP, they may use Sacrifice. Use regular attacks or any electric-based
attacks to defeat them. If Ryu has the Royal Sword (or possibly even
the weaker Barbarossa), he will be able to take them out with one hit.

-------
Tar Man
-------

HP- 78
Exp- 70
Zenny- 15
Steal Item- Clay Vase
Drop Item- MultiVitamin
Location- Mt. Myrneg, Mt. Boumore
Abilities- Tar Baby

Notes- Tar Men are almost impossible to damage unless you freeze them
with some kind of ice magic first (or get a critical hit). This is
cheaply and easily done by simply casting Frost, which is learned from
the game's first master, Mygas. Once you freeze the Tar Man, not only
will you be able to deal damage to it, but it'll also be rendered
completely harmless. From there, simply finish the Tar Man off with
normal attacks.

--------
Thanotos
--------

HP- ~200
Exp- 755
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Clothing
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Ryu's Dream
Abilities- Blizzard, Drain, Leech Power

Notes- The Thanotos is probably the toughest enemy that you'll find in
Ryu's Dream. You only fight them in the second area of Ryu's Dream,
and they usually come grouped with another enemy or two. Try to
eliminate them quickly with holy-based attacks, because they like to
steal your HP and AP with Drain and Leech Power, while occasionally
casting Blizzard. Although their Blizzard doesn't do all that much
damage, equipping a Ring of Ice will help not only against the
Thanotos, but against the next boss you have to face as well.

--------
Thrasher
--------

HP- 90
Exp- 185
Zenny- 110
Steal Item- Wisdom Seed
Drop Item- None
Location- Steel Grave, Colony
Abilities- Timed Blow

Notes- The key to fighting Thrashers is to either damage or kill them
before they get a chance to attack. The reason being that they really
like to use Timed Blow, which can cause quite a bit of damage if they
are at full HP. However, once they use Timed Blow, their HP will be
reduce to one, making them easy to finish off. Since they tend to come
in relatively large groups, Typhoon is a nice spell to use for taking
them all out in one shot. Their weakness to wind-based attacks also
make them very vulnerable to the Feather Sword.

-------
Thunder
-------

HP- 46
Exp- 16
Zenny- 18
Steal Item- Taser
Drop Item- None
Location- Wyndian Catacombs, Lighthouse
Abilities- Jolt

Notes- You'll most often find Thunders amongst a small group of Volts.
On the very first turn, the Thunder will cast Jolt on itself and his
Volt comrades, which will super-charge the Volts, allowing them to cast
Jolt on you. The charged Volts will also give you more experience
points, however, their combined Jolts can cause some serious damage.
If you want the extra Exp, kill the Thunder last. Both Thunders and
Volts seem to be weak against the Silver Knife, so equip it if you have
it.

------
Torast
------

HP- ~120
Exp- 32
Zenny- 8
Steal Item- N/A
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Inside McNeil Manor
Abilities- Sleep

Notes- He is the first, and probably the most annoying of the McNeil
ghosts that you'll fight throughout the manor. This is mainly because
of his Sleep spell. However, his normal attacks don't do too much
damage, and as long as you brought plenty of Healing Herbs along for
the mission, then you should be fine. His Sleep attack just annoyingly
prolongs the fight. Just use regular attacks to kill him and heal if
necessary. Remember that Silver Knives will cause extra damage.

---------
Toxic Fly
---------

HP- 40
Exp- 70
Zenny- 20
Steal Item- Antidote
Drop Item- None
Location- Underground Laboratory
Abilities- Chlorine

Notes- These guys are more of a pest than a hard enemy. Toxic Flies
tend to come in small groups, and they really like to use Chlorine.
Kill them quickly with normal attacks and spells like Typhoon and
Lightning to avoid the annoying effects of poison.

-------------
Toxic Man (1)
-------------

HP- 35
Exp- 335
Zenny- 25
Steal Item- Clay Vase
Drop Item- None
Location- Colony
Abilities- Chlorine, Venom Breath

Notes- The Toxic Man is not only unique because it loses HP every round
due to their own poisonous body, but they also come in three different
forms. You'll usually encounter them in small groups containing their
varied versions. There's really no way of telling them apart in battle
until you damage them and get a perspective on their HP levels. With a
most pathetic amount of HP, this version of the Toxic Man is the
weakest. You can more than likely take these guys out in one hit just
using your regular attacks.

-------------
Toxic Man (2)
-------------

HP- 175
Exp- 325
Zenny- 25
Steal Item- Clay Vase
Drop Item- None
Location- Colony
Abilities- Chlorine, Venom Breath

Notes- This is the medium version of the Toxic Man. Like the other two
versions of the Toxic Man, this one will take poison damage every turn,
and it specializes in poison inducing attacks. Try to use holy-based
attacks to eliminate them quickly. Equipping Ryu with the Ascension is
particularly effective here.

-------------
Toxic Man (3)
-------------

HP- 600
Exp- 225
Zenny- 25
Steal Item- Clay Vase
Drop Item- None
Location- Colony
Abilities- Chlorine, Venom Breath

Notes- Judging by its HP, this is definitely the most solid version of
the Toxic Man. Like the versions, it will lose HP every turn due to
poison, and it likes to use poisonous attacks. Since its HP is so high,
you may have to employ some high-powered melee attacks to defeat them
quickly. However, if you have any low AP-cost holy-type attacks, or any
holy property weapons (such as Ryu's Ascension), you will be able to
kill them more easily.

-------
Tricker
-------

HP- 100
Exp- 70
Zenny- 120
Steal Item- Gems
Drop Item- Thieves Knife
Location- Angel Tower, Ogre Road, Mt. Levett
Abilities- Blind, Flying Kick

Notes- Chances are that you'll first encounter the Tricker in the
random battlefields in the Rhapala region. These guys are fast, and
they like to annoy you with Blind, while occasionally using Flying
Kick, which can do quite a bit of damage. They are also known to run
away after one or two turns. Just have your more physical characters
use regular attacks, while Nina sticks to level 2 magic spells like
Iceblast. Also, their Gems may be worth stealing because they sell for
a decent amount of zenny (especially at the antique shop in the faerie
village if you've gotten that far yet).

--------
Vagabond
--------

HP- 125
Exp- 88
Zenny- 80
Steal Item- Moon Sword
Drop Item- Mithril Armor
Location- Ogre Road
Abilities- None

Notes- There's actually nothing all that special about the Vagabond.
They usually come in pairs and will just hit you with regular attacks.
You should be able to beat them down with only one or two normal
attacks. Besides that, you can steal Moon Swords from them, which are
good to sell.

-------
Vampire
-------

HP- 1000
Exp- 6000
Zenny- 1000
Steal Item- Burglar Garb
Drop Item- Lifestealer
Location- Myria Station Final Area
Abilities- Death, Evil Eye, Flare, Frost, Triple Blow

Notes- The Vampire is definitely one of the more formidable enemies
that you'll meet in the final stages of the game. You'll most often
encounter them amongst a flock of Night Bats. As long as there are
Night Bats around, the Vampire will regenerate 500 HP every turn, so
take out the Night Bats before going after the big guy himself.
However, the Vampire will offer double Exp if you kill him while there
are still Night Bats around. Once all of the lesser bats are gone, the
Vampire will lose his HP regeneration and begin pelting you with some
of his more deadly skills such as Triple Blow and Death. Now you'll
want to kill the Vampire off quickly using holy-based attacks such as
Holy Strike, Demonbane, Kyrie, and Aura. Holy property weapons such as
the Holy Avenger also work very well here.

---------
Vile Weed
---------

HP- 190
Exp- 750
Zenny- 0
Steal Item- Rice Ball
Drop Item- N/A
Location- Ryu's Dream
Abilities- Death, Heal, Molasses, Myollnir, Shield, Simoon, Sirocco,
           Watch Enemy

Notes- Don't let that very impressive list of abilities scare you.
Although the Vile Weed does have those spells, it doesn't have enough
AP to cast the really strong ones. Since you'll be wanting to conserve
AP as much as possible during this mission, just beat these guys down
using normal attacks.

----
Volt
----

HP- 34
Exp- 28
Zenny- 6
Steal Item- Taser
Drop Item- None
Location- McNeil Manor, Wyndian Catacombs, Lighthouse
Abilities- Charge, Jolt*

Notes- Normally, Volts are relatively weak enemies. They'll usually
use Charge, which does miniscule damage. However, if they get hit with
any type of electric spell (mainly Jolt, which Thunders will cast on
them), they will, in turn, be able to cast Jolt which does quite a bit
of damage. And since they tend to come in groups when Thunders are
around, their cumulative Jolts can be devastating. But when they are
charged with electricity, they give a lot more Exp (84 to be exact).
If you're fighting them at McNeil Manor where there are no Thunders
around, you can still take advantage of their Exp boost by having Rei
cast Jolt on them. Once you charge them up, kill them off with normal
attacks. Keep in mind that Silver Knives will cause extra damage to
them. Also note that they can only be charged up once.

------
Vulcan
------

HP- 300
Exp- 180
Zenny- 300
Steal Item- Protein
Drop Item- Magma Armor
Location- Mt. Zublo
Abilities- Lavaburst

Notes- At the beginning of every battle, the Vulcan is completely
dormant and practically invulnerable. However, if you hit the Vulcan
with a fire-based attack, it'll wake up and begin attacking you with
Lavaburst, a moderately powerful (and learnable) fire spell. But the
real benefit to waking up the Vulcan is the huge amount of experience
they yield. When awoken, they'll give a whopping 900 Exp! This makes
them a perfect enemy to fight for leveling up (not to mention stealing
Proteins off of as well). Once you wake them up, quickly kill them
with any ice-based attacks that you have. Nina should use Iceblast,
while Momo attacks with Ice Chrysm equipped.

------
Wraith
------

HP- ~100
Exp- 1250
Zenny- 275
Steal Item- Soul Gem
Drop Item- Divine Helm
Location- Path to Eden (Myria Station)
Abilities- Depress, Fireblast, Iceblast, Lightning, Typhoon

Notes- Wraiths are very unique enemies, as there is a certain method
you normally must use to kill them. You'll quickly learn that they are
completely immune to any kind of physical attacks. However, if you use
any elemental spell on them, their special barrier that protects them
against that element will be broken. For example, if you use a fire
elemental spell on them, their Fire Barrier will be destroyed. Once
you destroy an elemental barrier, they will become extremely vulnerable
to that element. So the best way to kill them is to have two of your
characters cast spells of the same element. Once their barrier is
destroyed, even weak level 1 spells should be capable of finishing
them off.

------
Zombie
------

HP- 78
Exp- 8
Zenny- 8
Steal Item- Clothing
Drop Item- Bracers
Location- Mt. Glaus Caverns, Wyndian Catacombs, Dauna Mine
Abilities- None

Notes- Zombies are pretty easy to cope with. They start off the battle
induced with confusion, and since they tend to come in small groups,
they'll often attack each other. You can actually directly control who
the confused Zombies attack by using Influence. Normal attacks will
suffice to kill them. Remember that since they are undead, healing
spells and holy-based attacks will deal incredible amounts of damage.

----------
Zombie Dr.
----------

HP- 145
Exp- 80
Zenny- 215
Steal Item- MultiVitamin
Drop Item- Vitamins
Location- Dauna Mine, Underground Laboratory
Abilities- Bone Dart, Vitalize

Notes- The Zombie Dr. is the strongest and most annoying of the
zombie-type enemies. This is mainly because they like to use Bone Dart
a lot, which causes confusion. However, on rare occasions when it is
grouped together with other zombie-type enemies, the Zombie Dr. will
cast Vitalize in attempt to heal its allies. But since all of his
allies are likely to be undead, the spell will actually kill them
instead of heal them. The Zombie Dr. is also undead, so use holy-based
attacks to kill it easily.

                              A. Fishing

#######################################################################

When you're at a fishing spot, you can access the fishing menu by
pressing the Square button (just as you would bring up the normal main
menu). From here you can select either "Gear, Data, or Rule." Under
"Gear" you can change your equipped rod and lure. "Data" displays a
list of fish that you've caught, the fishes' sizes, your fishing
points, and your fishing rating. The "Rule" menu displays basic fishing
controls and tips.

Once you've equipped your desired rod and lure, it's time to cast. Hit
the X button, and a green bar will start moving in the meter at the
bottom of the screen. This green bar represents your casting power,
and the longer it is the farther the cast will be. Hit the X button
again to stop the green bar and cast. To reel in your lure hold the X
button. You can manuver your lure by using the d-pad. The easiest way
to hook a fish is to manuver a lure it likes directly over it, and to
make sure the lure is near the same depth as the fish (the darker the
fish's shadow, the more shallow it is). You can also hook a fish by
positioning your lure near it and using techniques (described in
"Rule") to attract the fish. The biggest mistake you can make while
trying to hook a fish is not keeping a close eye on your depth meter.
If you let your lure drag along the bottom, it'll snag and you'll lose
it. Believe me, I've lost most of my lures by getting them caught on
the bottom, rather than a fish snapping the line.

When you hook a fish, three things will appear in the meter at the
bottom of the screen; a green bar cursor, a fish cursor, and a thin
red bar. The thin red bar represents the fish's stamina, and the longer
the bar the bigger the fish. Hold down the X button and track the fish
cursor with the green bar cursor using the d-pad. You're going to want
to keep the fish cursor inside your cursor as much as possible, because
if the fish cursor breaks away from your cursor for too long, the
tension will cause the line to snap. The line will also break if the
fish pulls the line out over 60m. To catch the fish, you have to pull
it all the way to the shore.

                              Manillo Shops
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fishing is probably most profitable through Manillo shops. Manillos are
merchants who travel the world's waters, trading items for fish. When
you catch a Manillo, you can see what items it has to offer and trade
in fish for those items.

                            B. Faerie Village

#######################################################################

Building and running a faerie village can be very profitable, because
doing so requires very little concrete investment on your part. The
main thing that you do have to put into a faerie vallage is time. You
can begin building your village as soon as Ryu becomes an adult. The
first time you visit the village as an adult, the faeries will be in
panic mode because they don't know how to take care of themselves. Talk
to the head faerie (the one that's always hanging out near the small
house) to begin organizing the village. If you say that you don't know
what to do, she'll talk to you about how to run the village. Tell her
that you know what to do to begin organizing.

The interface of the village menu is pretty simple. At the top, there's
a long rectangular box that contains all the faeries that are not
assigned to a task or job. Below that you can see your culture level
and your food supply. And below that are squares that each represent a
room. A room can hold 3 faeries and can be assigned to one job. You
start with only a single, one room building. On the right, there are
three large boxes where you can assign faeries to hunt, clear land, or
build new buildings. When you're managing you village, there are a few
things you need to be aware of:

Food- The faeries need food to survive. If your food supply runs out,
the faeries will start to die. The only way to obtain food is through
hunting. Be sure to have at least 2/3's of the population hunting at
all times when you first start cultivating your village, and then
gradually reduce it to half the population. Also make sure that the
majority of your hunters are skilled at it.

Culture- Scholars are a big part of the village because they develop
culture. The higher your culture rating, the faster your village will
grow overall.

Building/Clearing- Putting up new buildings allows you to open up more
shops and other jobs. But before you can build, you have to clear a
foundation. You also have to build and clear in sequence; clear some
land, build, then clear more land and build. Like all tasks that
require ability, the building and clearing will get done faster if the
workers are skilled in this craft.

Jobs- There are many different jobs that you can assign faeries to do,
like selling items, exploring, and running an inn. Most jobs can get
done more efficiently and effectively if the faerie doing the job is
skilled in that area.

Personal attributes- Each faerie has a unique set of four different
attributes, making them good at some things but nots so good at others.
When you select a faerie on the menu, you can view their personal
stats. Each of the four bars represent a skill that is used to do one
or more different kinds of jobs:

Red- Hunting, and exploring
Green- Building, and clearing
Dark Blue- Merchant, inn, and antique shop
Light Blue- Scholar, copy shop, and fortune teller

                                ~~~~~~~~

Scholar
~~~~~~~
Develops new jobs and culture. Scholars are responsible for thinking
up new jobs and helping the community grow faster.

Merchant
~~~~~~~~
Sells products. The shops that you can open up in your faerie village
may sell items, weapons, ect… that you can't find anywhere else. There
are three different kinds of shops you can open, and for each of those
three, there are two different qualities the products can specialize
in.

Ouroboros- 22000z                       Ice Halberd- 12500z

Inn
~~~
Runs an inn. It's really just an average everyday inn, except the cost
per night is very cheap compared to most inns in the later stages of
the game. If you place more than one faerie in the same inn, one of
them will run the inn while the others tell you things like how many
battles you've fought, how many times you've gone fishing, ect...

Gift Shop
~~~~~~~~~
Gives away items. This is potentially the most profitable job, because
you don't have to pay a cent for the items that it gives you. The
longer you wait before collecting your prize, the better the prize
will be. If you wait long enough (a few hours of gameplay), you can
get items like Wisdom Fruits and Shaman's Rings. But if you wait for a
very long time (I'd estimate over 20 hours of gameplay), you can even
get the fabled Spirit Ring.

Fortune Teller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Predicts the future. This is a practically useless job. All this job
does is dispense useless tidbits of information.

Explorer
~~~~~~~~
Explores and searches for items. A very useful but risky job. You can
send faeries out on trips to look for valuable and rare items. The
risky part is that faeries can die due to exploration failures. But
successful excursions can bare items like Icons and Spirit Rings.

Antique Shop
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Buys valuable items. You know all those items you have that have the
description "Appears valuable"? Well here you can sell those items for
a lot of money, much more than you'll get by selling them to normal
stores.

Music Shop
~~~~~~~~~~
Plays music. Although the music shop gives you no concrete benefits,
it's still worth opening. I like having one so I can listen to all the
game's cool songs.

Casino
~~~~~~
Plays various games. The casino lets you play two different mini-games;
High and Low or a Number Guessing game. High and Low is strictly for
money, but the number guessing game is for prizes. The best prize you
can get is a Spirit Ring, but it's very unlikely that you would be
able to guess a three digit number in one try.

Copy Shop
~~~~~~~~~
Makes a copy of an item. Like exploration, copying your items is both
useful and risky. If your item doesn't get copied, you usually just
get it back with no harm done. But sometimes your item will get turned
into a Rice Ball. <Rare items, such as Hourglasses, can be copied.
If you save OUTSIDE the faerie village, you can reset your game and
reenter the village until your item is successfully duplicated. Thanks
to bjhoopii@hotmail.com for bringing this to my attention.>

                            C. Hide & Seek

#######################################################################

When you visit Wyndia as an adult, you'll see that nothing much has
changed. Especially the kids you played Hide & Seek with all those
years ago. You can find them hanging out in front of the fountain near
the inoculation shop. Talk to the leader, and he'll challenge you to
another game of Hide & Seek. But this time, the whole known world is
their playgound to hide in. Fortunately, they all give you hints about
where they're going to hide:

Bais- "Somewhere in the northwest where there's lots of strong men"
Lang- "Someplace close"
Wynn- "That place that smells like oil"
Lee- "The place that connects this world with that world"

If you can't find them using these hints, then here's where everyone is
hiding:

Bais- He's hid himself deep inside the Dauna Mine, so I'll explain in
detail how to find him. From the elevator on the B3 level, Follow the
path right and then northeast onto a wooden bridge. Take the bridge up
to a junction and head northwest. Use you camera angles to check around
the last pillar along the path to find him.

Lang- Behind one of the tombstones in the Wyndian royal graveyard.

Wynn- Behind one of the houses at Junk Town.

Lee- Behind the Eastern Checkpoint gate.

Once you've found all of them, return to Wyndia and they'll all become
masters. They're just like normal masters, except instead of giving you
skills and spells, they grant you formations (with the exception of
Lang who gives you an item) For more information look them up in the
masters section.


#######################################################################

                    D. The Tower's Crystal Challenge

#######################################################################

Put Nina in your party and go to Momo's Tower when you want to play
this mini-game. The first time you visited the Tower, you probably
noticed the chest at the bottom of the pool surrounded by four
crystals outside. When you go inside, you'll also notice the big
crystal at the end of the pool. Activate this crystal using Nina's
wand, and you'll have 30 seconds to get back outside and light up the
four crystals surrounding the pool. However, you'll have to take the
long way out because the short way is blocked off by a laser beam.
Really the only advice I can give for this is to not go down the stairs
outside at an angle, because it slows you down. Also make sure you're
lined up with the crystal, and you're facing the crystal before you
try to acitvate it. If you complete the puzzle within the time limit,
you'll get one of three prizes from the chest depending on how much
time was left on the clock:

Less than 5 seconds left- MultiVitamin
5.0 to 5.99 seconds left- Wisdom Fruit
6 seconds or more left- Ring of Ice

                      E. Long Trips in the Desert

#######################################################################

After you cross the Desert of Death for the first time and arrive at
the Oasis, you'll find a man in town who's been across the desert too.
Talk to him, and you can hear the stories of how he lost an "important
item" and "nice outfit" during his travels. Well that "important item"
he's talking about is actually a Royal Sword, and the "nice outfit" is
Life Armor. If you're bold enough to go back out into the desert to
find these things (or if you're just bad at fishing and you want this
stuff), here are the directions:

To get the Royal Sword, leave FROM THE OASIS and go west for four
nights. Then head south until you find the sword in one of the random
battlefields, which should take about one or two nights.

To get the Life Armor, leave FROM THE FACTORY and go north for two
nights. Then head west for three nights, and check the random
battlefields for the armor.

Besides the sword and armor that the man lost, there are two other
items that you can get by taking extra trips into the desert. Those
are the Death Claws (one of the best weapons in the game for Peco) and
Speed Boots. Here are the directions for obtaining them:

From the OASIS, simply head directly west until you come across a
random battlefield with a chest containing the Death Claws. This should
happen after about seven nights. To get the Speed Boots, do the same
thing, except go east from the Oasis.

I would not recommend taking the long trips in the desert, just because
you can get the Royal Sword and Life Armor from the Manillo shop near
Kombinat. Plus by catching the fish you need to obtain these to items,
you're sure to add some points to your fishing record. But if you're
bent on getting them this way, then by all means do it.

                         F. Challenge Monsters

#######################################################################

At the Container Yard there dwells two kinds of random battle monsters
that are incredibly hard to beat. These two enemies are none other than
the powerful relative of the Codger and Adept, the Arch Mage, and the
purple Multibot with an attitude, the Berserker. Both of these guys
make Dragon Lord and Myria look like a joke. They are undoubtedly the
hardest enemies in the game. If you think you can beat these two with
brute strength, think again (well unless you're like at level 99).
You will only be able to overcome them with a good, well thought out
strategy. You'll also need to be at a decent level. Level 40-45 is
ideal.

%%%%%%%%%
Arch Mage
%%%%%%%%%

Although these two monsters are pretty much equally hard, the Arch Mage
is probably the easier of the two just because he has five times less
HP than the Berserker. The Arch Mage has 3000 HP, and his spells are
extremely powerful. His Myollnir spell does about 500 damage, which is
more than enough to instantly kill one of your party members. He also
has Blizzard, but he uses it once in a blue moon. The Arch Mage's most
deadly attack is Mind Sword, because it does a ton of damage and there
are very few ways to defend against it. He'll also add insult to injury
by casting Benediction on your party if two of your members are wiped
out, just so he can kill them all over again. But if you think all this
is bad, here's one more thing to worry about; he automatically
regenerates 1500 HP per turn. By defeating the Arch Mage you get a few
nice rewards including 2000z, 48000 Exp., and the Holy Avenger (Rei's
ultimate weapon and a good weapon for Ryu as well).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
How I Beat the Arch Mage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Because I've beaten several Arch Mages, I'll just explain my routine.
I go to the Container Yard with Ryu, Rei, and Momo in my party, and I
have them in a Chain Formation led by Rei. The only equipment that
matters to me are the accessories. I have Rei equipped with two Speed
Boots so that his agility is well over 100, Ryu has the Spirit Ring
and Light Bangle, and Momo has a Soul Gem and a Thunder Ring so that
she'll absorb Myollnir as HP. I can also just equip another Soul Gem
if she gets hit with Mind Sword.

The first turn I have Rei cast Resist so he'll be immune to everything,
Ryu turns into the ultimate Kaiser (Infinity, Trance, Radiance) mainly
so that he'll have enough HP to survive at least two of the the Arch
Mage's attacks and have an extra turn, and have Momo cast Speed on Rei
so that he gets an extra turn. So no matter what the Arch Mage does
this turn, nobody can die and stay that way. It's pointless to attack
during this extra turn because the Arch Mage is about to regenerate. So
I have Ryu use Focus, and have Rei do something like cast Speed on
Momo. Now at the second normal turn I have Rei cast Resist so he can't
die and break the Chain Formation. Ryu begins the assault by using
Shadowwalk (Having used Focus the turn before this does about 2000
damage), and Momo casts War Shout or heals Ryu if he was attacked the
first turn. After that it's the same as the first turn; nobody is going
to die. The second extra turn is the finale. Ryu uses Shadowwalk again,
Rei slams the Arch Mage with Aura, and Momo casts one of her strongest
spells like Myollnir. And that's overkill.

%%%%%%%%%
Berserker
%%%%%%%%%

The Berserker is a little tougher than the Arch Mage because it has
15000 HP, five times more than the Arch Mage. This guy has three
attacks that you need to consider. Its normal attack can be considered
an instant kill to anyone who is unprotected. The Berserker's Fire Whip
attack is just as powerful, and it's vs. all targets. As a trump card,
the Berserker will cast the spell Berserk when it gets low on HP. You
can steal Aries Gloves (the best shield in the game) from the Berserker
considerably easily during the fight. Your rewards for beating it are
3000z, 30000 Exp., and there's a chance that it'll drop the Rufad's
Spear (A weapon for Garr that makes a good subbordinate to the Beast
Spear).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
How I Beat the Berserker
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I've defeated even more Berserkers than Arch Mages, so once again I'll
just explain how I normally fight them. I use the same party members,
the same formation, and practically the same equipment for this battle
that I use against the Arch Mage. The only change in equipment is that
Momo has the Ring of Fire instead of the Thunder Ring.

The first turn I have Rei cast Resist so he can't get killed, and have
Ryu transform using the Force, Flame, and Defender genes so that he'll
be immune to Fire Whip, and he'll have just enough HP to survive one of
the Berserker's normal attacks. I have Momo cast Speed on Rei so that
he gets an extra turn. The Berserker starts off the battle confused,
so it'll always use its normal attack. During the extra turn Ryu uses
Aura on the Berserker (Which typically does 1000 damage), and Rei casts
Speed on Momo. The second turn Rei uses Resist (like he will on every
normal turn), Ryu casts Focus, and Momo either heals Ryu or casts
Protect on Ryu just to add a little insurance. With this setup, none
of my party members can get killed. During the next extra turn Ryu uses
Aura (Which now does about 2000 damage because I used Focus the turn
before), Rei casts Charm, and Momo either heals Ryu or casts assist
magic like Protect or War Shout. I keep up this pattern of Ryu Focusing
then attacking, Rei Resisting then using Pilfer to get the Aries
Gloves, and Momo healing Ryu and casting assist magic. When the
Berserker uses Berserk, I know that I have to finish it off before it
gets another chance to attack, because Ryu won't survive with its
attack power that high. So if my Aura during the next extra turn
doesn't finish it off, I just use Aura again the turn after that
instead of using Focus.

Once you develop a strategy that works for you, you'll be hunting these
two for sport in no time at all.

              11. Balio and Sunder: The Age Old Question

=======================================================================

***WARNING- THIS SECTION MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***

                              ============
                              Introduction
                              ============

The Balio and Sunder controversy is, by far, the most deeply examined
and discussed rumor in Breath of Fire 3. It's a controversy that's been
plaguing the game pretty much since it first came out. So what exactly
is the Balio and Sunder question? Well, early in the game, your group
is attacked at your house in Cedar Woods by two ruffian horsemen named
Balio and Sunder. Storywise, this is a fight that you are not supposed
to win, because this causes the separation of Ryu, Rei, and Teepo.
However, a rumor got started many years ago that claimed that it is
possible to win this fight, despite the fact that winning the fight
would conflict with the game's story.

Many Breath of Fire 3 players have carried out all sorts of trials and
experiments to determine if Balio and Sunder are, indeed, mortal at
Cedar Woods. Not a single one of them has succeeded in defeating Balio
and Sunder. Many conclusions have been drawn from these trials, and
much evidence has been produced that proves the rumors wrong. So, the
answer to the "Balio and Sunder Question" is that THEY CANNOT BE BEATEN
AT CEDAR WOODS! In case you're skeptical, or if you just want to know
why, then read on. The purpose of this section is to give undeniable
proof that Balio and Sunder are invincible.

This section is dedicated to all of the Breath of Fire 3 players
world-wide who have toiled in their attempts to beat Balio and Sunder.

                          ===================
                          How the Rumor Began
                          ===================

So how did this rumor even arise anyway? Well, it was actually started
inadvertently by a mistake in the game's official strategy guide,
written by Prima. On page 22 there is a boss stat box for the Balio and
Sunder fight at Cedar Woods which states the following:

"You can beat Balio and Sunder, although you must have extremely high
levels to do so. Whether you win or lose, the outcome is the same, but
winning will net you a Broad Sword and Asbestos Armor"

Sure, this may seem like good enough proof that they're beatable, but
let's take a deeper look into this. There are no specifics in that
statement which clearly indicate that the statement is referring to
the fight at Cedar Woods, besides the fact that it is inside the boss
stat box for the Cedar Woods fight. Now, if you look through the rest
of the guide, you'll find that there are many cases in which pictures
and captions are in the wrong place (Examples: pages 51, 61, 65, 66,
69, 70, 71, 80, 82, OK I think you get the idea). And since you do
fight Balio and Sunder on two other occasions, this means that this
could simply be another case in which information was misplaced. Most
likely, the above statement refers to the second time you fight Balio
and Sunder (in the dungeon of Wyndia Castle). Why? Because in that
fight, the outcome is pretty much the same whether you win or lose, and
Balio and Sunder MAY drop a Broad Sword and Asbestos Armor if you win.

Interesting, huh? Now I'm not trying to say that the Prima guide is
completely wrong, but it is clearly mistaken. This misplaced piece of
information is what sparked the whole controversy.

                         ======================
                         Experiments and Trials
                         ======================

Now, here are just a few documented trials and experimental fights that
some players (including myself) have performed in order to determine if
Balio and Sunder could be beaten.

One of the earliest and most noteworthy of these experiments resulted
from a group called the "Dawn of Victory", which consisted of a few
people who dedicated themselves to trying to defeat Balio and Sunder
back when the controversy was still unsolved. A Game FAQs Message Board
user by the name of eternal wielder (now Eternalw) performed the
following experiment which ended the Dawn of Victory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Eternalw did the experiment with Ryu at level 26. Here is his
commentary on the fight:

"The first thing that I did in battle was immediately cast Influence
with Ryu on Balio, so Sunder would attack him. As long as Ryu lived,
the influence under Sunder would be in effect. After that first round,
I had Ryu cast Barrier on all three of my characters. This reduced
Balio's Lightning spell's damage to 20 or so. Teepo had well over
150AP, and with him casting magic ball combined with meditation each
round, how could I possibly lose? Rei attacked doing well over 40HP
damage up to 100+ damage on criticals to Balio. Each of my characters
had ex turns, so things were looking up. I healed only when my HP got
low, around 30 or so. Ryu used up all the spell casting items and then
attacked and healed the party when necessary. My main focus was to get
rid of Balio, since he seemed to be the most vulnerable AND most
dangerous of the duo."

"I recall having Teepo mediatate for two rounds and then hitting Balio
with magic ball, which did well over 300HP per hit. Teepo used up ALL
his AP during the first round. Doing 300HP per hit with his magic ball,
and since magic ball cost 2AP per cast, 150(min)/2 is 75. That would
mean.. in one hour 300*75= 22,500 with JUST magic ball in the first
round. That is the BARE MINIMUM. Rei does about 40 or so HP damage
(min)... so if Teepo can cast 75 times... since he wastes a turn using
meditate.. Rei would have to do at least double that which would be
150*40, which would turn out to be... 6000 HP damage in one hour, bare
minimum. For Ryu, I'd give him 40 attacks in one hour, since he does
20HP or so damage (min), that would turn out to be 800HP about for an
hour. As for Sunder, I'll give him a cheap total of 10HP per hit.. and
since he doesn't get EX turns, I'll give him 75 attacks or so, which
would be 75*10, 750 per hour. This is ABOUT an hour."

"Around an hour in the fight, Balio runs out of AP. I remember having
about 23 herbs or so after this part. Even when Balio runs out of AP,
he still tries to cast it. So this leaves the battle at a stance. An
endless stance, sort of. Balio is trying to cast Lightning all the
time, but can't, while Sunder keeps hitting his brother. The first
round totals (MIN) are.... 750HP + 800HP + 6000HP + 22,500HP which
totals to be.... 30050HP total to JUST BALIO. Now, since Teepo is now
out of AP and Ryu and Rei can just attack (since Balio is endlessly
trying to cast Lightning and Sunder is whacking him), I decide to turn
on auto battle. What does my party do? They attack Balio. They keep
attacking him. I wait for 15mins.. they still are attacking him. So I
decide.. to let it run. Rei does 40HP, while Teepo and Ryu do about 20
or so HP damage per round. The group can attack up to about 4 times
(MIN) in a minute. I calculated this out myself.. and I'm 99% sure this
total is bit lower than it should be. If the group alone can attack 4
times in one minute (including ex rounds), doing (40+20+20)4... which
would equal (80)4= 320 HP damage per minute to just Balio."

"Don't forget about Sunder, which can do about 20HP damage per round,
and since he doesn't get an EX turn, then he just adds 20HP to the
320HP damage dealt with the group onto Balio, resulting in 340HP
damage per minute. THIS IS THE BARE MINIMUM FOLKS. So how many minutes
are there in an hour? If you said 60, you are correct. So, multiply
340HP by 60 minutes to get 20400 HP per hour. So excluding the first
hour, I left it on for 10 more hours, so ten times 20,400 is ....
204,000 HP damage to JUST BALIO in 10 HOURS. Add this with the first
round, 30,400, to get 234,400HP damage dealt to just Balio. I don't
know about you, but it just makes me sick to think Capcom would make a
single player play for WELL OVER 11 hours just to beat an enemy- if
they are even beatable. The reasonable conclusion, Balio cannot be
beaten."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And now, here are some experiments I have done. The first serious trial
I did was several years ago, at which time I leveled Ryu, Rei, and
Teepo up to about level 35 before trying to beat Balio and Sunder.
After fighting them for about an hour or so, Balio had run out of AP.
This was the first time I had learned for myself that Balio's AP is
actually limited. I also noticed that after Balio runs out of AP, he
will then attempt to cast Lightning EVERY turn from that point on. This
renders him harmless. Also, if you cast the spell Influence (learned
from Boss Goblins) on Balio, Sunder will attack him. I discovered that
with this set up, Balio and Sunder could no longer attack your party
once Balio runs out of AP. However, I fought them for a while longer
(focusing all attacks on Balio), and ended up throwing in the towel
with both horsemen still standing.

A while afterwards, my brother's friend started a new game file. So my
brother, his friend, and I decided to tinker with a Game Shark. We
activated codes for infinite HP and AP, and maximum Attack Power. Other
codes were turned on as well, but they weren't relevant to the
experiment. Then we got into the fight with Balio and Sunder. With this
set up, each character was hitting Balio for over 700 damage with each
attack, and Sunder would add on an additional 40-50 damage to Balio
every round due to the Influence trick. We battled it out for an hour
and Balio still was not dead. So, we then left the game on auto-attack
and went out for at least two hours (It may have even been closer to
three hours, but unfortunately I can't remember exactly how long we
were gone). When we came back, Balio was still alive so we decided to
call it quits.

Later on, I made a rough calculation of how much damage we dealt to
Balio. I made the calculation underestimating the average amount of
damage dealt with each hit and the number of turns we could pull off
per hour in auto-attack mode. I also didn't take into account critical
hits, which would water down the calculated damage from the actual
damage even further. In the end, it came out to over 900,000 damage,
although it was probably closer to a million because this was an
underestimated calculation. Now here are some conclusions that could
be drawn from this:

1. They can't be beaten with Game Shark cheats activated. Surprisingly,
this was not only something that I thought could have been a factor,
but this was also theorized by the Dawn of Victory, who believed that
the game activated some kind of program to make Balio and Sunder
invincible if a Game Shark was turned on.

2. They have an HP multiplier. This means that their maximum HP is
equal to one of your party member's HP multiplied by a certain number.
This is a boss HP system used in games such as "Lunar: Silver Star
Story".

3. We simply did not deal enough damage.

As a final experiment, I decided to eliminate the first two factors
above by fighting them one last time without using a Game Shark.
However, this time I only had the patience to level Ryu, Rei, and Teepo
up to around level 24. This time, I thought it would be more practical
to try to kill off Sunder first, because once Balio runs out of AP he
can no longer attack you, whereas Sunder can. In the first stage of the
battle, I attacked Sunder as much as possible while healing from
Balio's Lightning spell and waiting for him to run out of AP. I had 99
Rainbow Trouts in my inventory along with 2 or so Wisdom Seeds (dropped
by Mage Goos) that I could use to restore Ryu's AP, which he was using
for casting Magic Ball (learned from Mygas). All of my characters had
extra turns.

Balio ran out of AP after about an hour and a half or so. I then
proceeded to focus all of my attacks on Sunder for the next 4 or so
hours. After that much time had passed, and I had depleted all of my
AP restoration items, I decided to just leave the game on auto-attack
(Note- The auto-attack targeted Balio). Then I went out of town for the
weekend, leaving the game on.

I returned home about 44 and a half hours later to find that Balio was
still alive. I shut my overworked Playstation off and sat down to make
another underestimated calculation of how much damage I did to Balio
alone. And since this time I kept much better track of how many turns
I could pull off in one minute under auto-attack, this calculation was
likely to be more accurate than the one in my previous experiment. It
came out to over 1,800,000 damage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            ================
                            Here's the Proof
                            ================

In case the above trials weren't convincing enough for you, here is the
UNDENIABLE proof of Balio and Sunder's immortality. And believe it or
not, the proof is actually quite simple.

After doing a little bit of testing with the auto-attack function, I've
learned that if you use auto-attack while fighting against a group of
similar enemies (enemies with similar HP values), your party will
target the enemy with the LOWEST HP. Now throughout the game, all of
the bosses that you fight in pairs (Examples- Ammonites, Scylla and
Charybdis) all have similar or equal HP values. This would make it safe
to assume that if Balio and Sunder could be beaten, their HP values
would be similar to each other.

Now, looking back to my last experiment, after focusing all attacks
Sunder for around 5 hours straight, it would also be safe to say that
Sunder would then have less HP than Balio. However, I used auto-attack
and my party targeted Balio, not Sunder. This means that their HP is
either infinite or locked, which means that they can't actually take
damage.

To back this even further, Kusanagi used a program to attempt to
determine Balio and Sunder's HP values and discovered that their HP
values are indeed locked. Other similar tests have been done with a
Game Shark, in which Balio and Sunder's HP values were reduced to
nearly zero, and even after doing more than enough damage to kill them,
they still didn't die (Thanks to RPGKobe for telling me about this
one).

Now, hopefully all of this evidence has been enough to convince you
that BALIO AND SUNDER CANNOT BE DEFEATED AT CEDAR WOODS!
