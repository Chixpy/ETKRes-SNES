<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<SINGLE CHARACTER CHALLENGE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
==============================================================================

Single Character Challenge, or "SCC", as I abbreviate it: You may have seen
an SCC for other games. The goal of an SCC is to play through a game using
only one of the characters in that game while keeping that character in
his/her "purest" (will define "purest" later) form. This helps the player get
a firm understanding of a character's strengths and weaknesses as well as
push the skills and patience of the player to and past his/her limits.

==============================================================================

                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               Version History
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.0- Added original 9 sections, all of which are "completed" (as in 
first version) except the sections on "The Characters"; "Mini-Walkthrough"; 
"Faerie Village"; all of Ryu SCC is complete. 10/18/03 32KB
 Personal Notes: This is the first version of this guide. I'm not sure how
 this guide will turn out, but I believe this guide has an auspicious future.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.5- Added more information on Ryu; added Nina's basic information and 
started Nina SCC (start through XXIX); fixed some editing errors; modified the
format of the guide. 11/28/03 47KB
 Personal Notes: I had to make a few changes. The first version had a few
 errors in it. I started Nina too. It's... not easy >_<.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.3- Overhauled the guide to fit the entirely new format; added the
new "Section #3- My Contributors"; added/changed the rules and advice;
finished Nina SCC; added Teepo SCC; added Jamerington's Rei SCC and
[beginnings of] his Garr SCC; any empty spots in strategies will be filled in
the next update. 12/27/03 103KB
 Personal Notes: Yeah, more formatting changes. Well, at least I've got my
 first contributor now! I hope there will be more of you in the future! I've
 started a new section to recognize contributor work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.0- Added some ASCII art ^_^; redid formatting... again... and so
soon; started Momo SCC (start through XXI) added remainder of Jamerington's
Garr SCC. 1/7/04 125KB
 Personal Notes: These should be the last formatting changes in the guide for
 a while >_> <_<... I hope. Anyway, there's nothing particularly different
 about this update otherwise. Just more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.0- Increased the bulk of the information in the mini-walkthrough;
added new sections: "Section #8- The Lavaman Trick" and "Section #9- Archmage
& Berserker". 2/18/04 158KB
 Personal Notes: I know, I know. There's little to no actual new data here.
 This update primarily consists of data I simply hadn't typed out before.
 Also,I thought the mini-walkthrough needed more to it than just boss info,
 so I added in a few notes outside the bosses. Hopefully, there will be more
 of that later on too. Also, I had to include something on Lavaman, Archmage,
 and Berserker, so I started sections which discuss strategies concerning
 them; they're not very big right now though...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.6- Separated my work from my contributors' work in Section 6
"Contributors' Work"; completed my Momo SCC; removed my symbol; added Peco
Master's review of Peco; added new Section 7 ""Secondary" SCCs"; more
formatting; added a couple FAQs. 4/13/04 180KB
 Personal Notes: Ah! Finally! Lots of new material, new sections, and an
 explanation on how to go about playing and writing those "Secondary" SCCs.
 I'm thinking of adding something like general strategies towards handling
 enemies in each area. It's a big project, so I'll leave at this for now.
 Expect to see it in the next update though!

==============================================================================

                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Section #1- Rules of the Challenge
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One Character- This is a rule I shouldn't even need to state, but I will
anyway. You are allowed to use one and only one character, bar a few
exceptions which I will note. These include "stall points" (periods in the
game in which a character is unusable), impossible to win battles with one 
character, and any other occasions of which I will make special note in 
the guide.

"Purest" Form- I mentioned this before but will now define it. "Purest"
Form means an unmodified character. This includes the following: no masters
(for their skills and stat changes at level up), no examining monsters (for
their skills), and no items to increase a character's base stats.

Battle Formations- Challengers are limited to only the starting battle
formations (Normal, Defense, Attack). One could argue that formations should
be limited only to Normal or perhaps to all of them. To the former, Defense
and Attack are allowed because I look at them as a sort of front and back
rows, which is in plenty of RPGs and is certainly fine to use. To the latter,
you must remember that those formations are learned from masters, and, in
this challenge, a character cannot use anything gained from a master.

Faerie Village- There are some limitations on the use of faerie village. 
The copy shop may not be used to copy items that would seriously decrease
the difficulty of the SCC. I'll leave the discernment up to you about which
items should not be copied (e.g. Hourglass; other suggestions are welcome).
Also, try to limit the number of Soul Gems you buy.

Soul Gems- I have to put a limitation on the number of soul gems you can
use. Seriously, how fair would it be to be able to die 99 times against Myria.
So, unless I change my mind on the issue, the maximum number of Soul Gems
allowed in any battle is 2. Any exceptions to this will be made at my
discernment. These Soul Gems do not have to be equipped at the beginning of
the battle though. They may be equipped during any time at that battle, but
only 2 of them may be consumed, used, etc.

Level Limit- Keep the level of your SCC character to level 50, at maximum,
level 60 (I can understand this for some SCCs *coughNinacough*).

Stall Points- If you're SCC character is at a stall point, you're
of course allowed to use other characters, boost their stats, give them
masters, etc. However, you are not allowed to transfer any skills over to
your SCC character.

Killing your Characters- Characters are revived after every battle, so
you'll have to kill them each battle immediately (unless you're Ryu about to 
transform into Hybrid; see II. D.)(killing them can become a little tedious). 
Once you kill those characters, they may not be revived in that battle again.
Exception: XXVIII.Mikba

Running from Battles- I want to make note of this. When running from a
battle, you *do not* have to kill your other party members.

Inoculations- I discourage the use of them, but you may if you like or if
you need them.

Attacking Items- Unlike inoculations, this I clearly condemn. You may 
under no condition use these unless it is absolutely necessary. e.g. Molotov
against Hugeslug.

Equipping Other Characters- This is a reversal on a previous decision. You
may not equip your non-SCC party members with equipment. They are not even 
supposed to be there. The only exception I *might* allow is a Midas Stone.

No Gameshark or Other Cheats- Obviously... I just thought I'd say it for
those who might actually try it just because I hadn't said it. 

==============================================================================

                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Section #2- Some Helpful Tips
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, don't try this challenge unless you've already played through
the game before.

Another thing: Do not choose to do an SCC on a character simply because the
character is popular or has one cool move. That by no means implies that the
character will perform as well in an SCC. If you choose to ignore this
warning, you may find yourself in a very tough situation as you try something
that may not be feasible with your level of knowledge and skill of the game.

The Golden Piece of Advice for the challenge: If you can't beat an enemy, 
run away! And, if you need experience, find an easy to kill enemy which gives
plenty of it.

Ryu's hybrid forms can really help (another iffy topic); keep in mind
though that your characters must be alive for it to work. You are allowed
to transform into a Hybrid form once per battle (see Killing Your Characters).

If you're looking for the easiest SCC to start with, choose Ryu. His
is ridiculously easy. In many ways, his SCC is easier than an ordinary
game!

Read the strategies for a boss before you fight it. Get any equipment or
items that you don't have yet for that battle and make sure you are at the
recommended level (a character's stats have a set standard for level up; they
only change when the character is given a master).

When you get characters that you're not going to use, steal any useful
equipment they might have (e.g. Nina's "Soul Gem" or Garr's "Titan's Belt")
even if you get the characters in the middle of a battle!

Here's an obvious tip: save often. You don't want to die after hours of
work just because you had "one more little thing to take care of". God knows
how many times I've had to swallow those words.

Stock yourself to the brim in items. When you find a useful item, get as
many of them as possible. For magicians, this means Black Porgies and Wisdom
Fruits. For everyone without healing magic (or even with healing magic), this
means Healing Herbs, Vitamin(s), and MultiVitamins.

All praise the deity that is the Ivory Charm! This is without a doubt one
of the greatest pieces of equipment in the game. It halves elemental damage,
raises resistance to status effects, raises resistance to Death, doubles the
effects of healing spells, and restores HP in battle and on the field. That is
quite a repertoire of abilities for one piece of equipment! Be sure to get
this ASAP via the Distant Fairy Expeditions. If you get this wondrous piece
of equipment sooner than in the strategies (I could have put into the boss
strategies the instant you could theoretically get it, but I assumed you would
not spend countless hours trying to get it and input it into my strategies at
a more reasonable time), PUT IT ON.

Once you can buy Soul Gems, don't go anywhere without them, especially in
dangerous areas.

Fishing... what a wonderful thing. Seriously, fishing is beyond great. You
get so many of the things you need for success from fishing. Whether it's the
fish themselves, especially as the mighty Black Porgy, or it's the items you
get through the Manillo shops, such as the Royal Sword and Life Armor, fishing
truly does save you quite a few times.

Obviously, these are the people who have made significant contributions to
this guide, particularly "The Characters", "Mini-Walkthrough", and "Fairy
Village". 

To differentiate between each individual's work (as well as my own), a symbol 
or number will be placed next to the subjective contributions given 
by these individuals. 

**Any questions or comments on another contributor's work should be e-mailed
to me, and I will forward it to that contributor.**

This is where you can be an integral part in this guide. If you want to make
contributions as well, just contact me. I want alternate strategies to what is
already up. I'm far from perfect. Eventually, I will eventually write
strategies for all the SCCs, but I'm run for time these days and can't cover
everything. If you have an alternate, maybe superior strategy to a boss or
through a level, tell me (test it out first though to make sure it works
though)! If you want to write an entire SCC strategy yourself, do it! Tell me
you want to write it, play within the rules, [at a minimum] record all of the
data that is in the posted strategies (that is, if you want to write an entire
SCC strategy; if you want to contribute less, then you don't need all that;
just stay consistent in what you give me, and send me the information when
you're done. We'll work out the details, and, if it looks good, I'll post it.

-Alright, now, after thinking about this for a while, I realized it would be
stupid to give myself a symbol as it would only cause confusion in parts of
the guide where there is no symbol.
Contributions: Founder of this guide; Created first 12 sections; Proofreads 
 the guide; Has written Ryu, Teepo, Nina, and Momo SCCs
Presently: Peco SCC; Working on the guide in general
My Comment: ME! This is me (in case you hadn't figured it out)! Inspired
 by Meeple Lard's Final Fantasy VI's Single Character Challenge Guide, I
 founded this guide. I have allot of ideas and plans to expand this guide
 quite a bit to the greatness it deserves.

My Comment: He wrote a nice review of Peco, but... that's it. I was hoping for
 something more, but it's still good, bar a few corrections I had to ask him
 to make and a couple grammatical things I had to clear up myself...

                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the ratings for difficulty are subject to change because I won't be
able to most accurately give difficulty ratings until I've completed all 6
(7 technically) SCCs.

Also, the Spells sections for each character will have a # of stars (1-5) next
to each spell to show each spell's overall usefulness.

Difficulty for character- Godhood: Seriously, putting difficult, SCC, and 
Ryu in the same sentence is just wrong. There is a little difficulty before he
gets his dragon forms, and a couple battles afterwards, but, otherwise, it's 
smooth sailing.

"When out of herbs, use a spell": Whether it's HP or status healing, Ryu's
got it covered. Heal and Purify are good early on before you have the money to
buy Healing Herbs and Antidotes. Rejuvenate and Remedy also prove useful for
a long time, that is, until you can buy Vitamin(s) and Panaceas in large
stock. Finally, Restore's usefulness is a little limited though because, by
the time you get it, you will likely have access to buy all the MultiVitamins
you need from the Faerie Village.

"From all damage to no (or at least not much) damage": Defense magic, another
one of Ryu's specialties, is particularly helpful when you can't transform, 
when you're low on AP (so that you can't transform, but can still cast 
Defense spells), etc. This generally applies to early on, especially for 
Protect. Perhaps it may not be all that important, but you might be surprised 
at how a Protect or Barrier can make or break you in battle.

"The perfect sphere": If you look character statistics as three dimensional
polyhedra, then Ryu is a perfect sphere, the perfect balance of all stats.
Geometry aside, Ryu has the power to smash all, the defense to endure all, the
speed to outrun enemies, the intelligence to cast spells effectively, and high
HP and AP counts. Not to mention that he excels in all these categories. What
more could you ask for? 

"Nice digs": Ryu can definitely equip some of the game's better pieces of
equipment. I mean, just look at his final equipment configuration (He would 
have even better final equipment, but SCC rules prevent Rei from stealing and
Ryu learning Steal to steal). 

"Limitless forms and powers": Accession makes this too easy; you have 
an almost limitless number of attack styles to choose from (all bow to the 
mighty dragon gene system), you can control him (except for berserk Kaiser) 
*coughWeretigercough*, and, most importantly, the dragon forms have a separate
HP gauge so that if the form is defeated, you simply revert back to the form 
Ryu had before *coughWeretigercough* (yet again). Anyway, one day I might add
a section specializing in Ryu's dragon forms... maybe.

"He has a flaw?!": It's true, Ryu has one and only flaw. That would be his
lack of any attack magic in human form. You could count Bonebreak, but you can
only use that at "fixed intervals", so it doesn't really count. I don't mean 
to say Ryu has no attack magic. He has plenty of attack magic... in a dragon 
form.

To increase difficulty, attempt Ryu's SCC without any Soul Gems. That should
make it remotely (the key word is remotely) challenging.

Summary of Pros and Cons:

Pros:
All Healing Spells
Good Assist Spells
Perfect Average of All Stats
Can Use Great Equipment
ACCESSION

Cons:
No Attack Magic Outside of Dragon Forms (I had to put something under Cons.)

Difficulty for character- Training: Think of Teepo's SCC as a trial, a very
easy, yet effective trial. It gives you an opportunity to become associated
with an SCC, and the best part: if you like SCCing, you can continue in that
game with another character, providing you want to do a Nina, Momo, Peco, or
Garr SCC. If you want to do Ryu or Rei, you'll have to start over.

"I [Teepo] can do anything, you [Ryu] can do better; I can do anything
better than you": Teepo excels in all stats just like Ryu. In fact, Teepo goes
even further. Teepo can equip everything that Ryu can.

"BOOM!": Teepo has some nice attack magic. It's too bad he's not around long
enough to fully develop it, especially Iceblast and Fireblast...

Summary of Pros and Cons:

Pros
Perfect Average of All Stats
Can Use Great Equipment
Good Attack Magic (for that point in the game)

Cons
No Healing Magic (I had to put something under Cons)

Spells:
Lv.1-Flare***                          Lv.13-Iceblast*
Lv.4-Frost**                           Lv.14-Fireblast*
Lv.7-Simoon*****

C. Rei
 (coming eventually...)

  !!!!!! 
D.!Nina!
  !!!!!!

Difficulty for character- Hard: Nina's SCC is initially only slightly
difficult. However, as you continue, it becomes harder and harder. I can't
be sure since I have completed all the SCCs, but I suspect this might be
the hardest SCC.

"Wow! She's just like a Black Mage! That's good... right?": Indeed, that is
true. She has the high AP, intelligence, and spells that a Black Mage would 
have. Unfortunately, she also has the measly HP, power, and defense 
deficiencies of a Black Mage. Just try beating any game with only a Black
Mage. It's probably not the easiest thing you've ever tried.

"Crap... that element doesn't work. Okay then, how about this one?": Nina has
a huge variety in elemental magic. In a way, it makes her quite versatile, but
she's still far too dependent on her magic.

"Faster than a sprinter but slower than a tiger": Nina can outrun most of the
enemies in the game and can even get the drop on many boss level enemies, and
this partially makes up for her many other... "flaws". However, it's still
not very valuable an asset in the end because she usually can't get the EX
turn when she *really* needs it (like other characters who can such as Rei).
However, there is a catch. Indeed, Nina can outrun many enemies. The problem
of course is her puny defense. Because she can't take a hit, she needs to be
placed in Defense Formation which lowers her speed much of time.

"Ordinary enemies, bow down before me; bosses..." *Nina runs away*: Nina
can really toast random encounter enemies, but again she falls short where it
really counts: she has an almost insurmountable amount of trouble when dealing
with bosses. This usually results in the little Wyndian princess getting
pounded to a pulp if you're not prepared.  

Summary of Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Extremely High AP and Intelligence
Moderately High Speed
Large Repertoire of Attack Spells
Can Easily Dispatch of [most] Regular Enemies

Cons:
Low HP, Power, and Defense
Not Fast Enough for the EX Turn
Overly Dependent on AP Usage
(from Cons 1 and 3) [Therefore] Requires Large # of Healing Items (HP, AP, 
 status)
Increasing Difficulty in Boss Battles

Spells:
Start-Cyclone**                        Lv.15-Typhoon**      
Start-Frost**                          Lv.16-Lightning***
Start-Jolt***                          Lv.18-Drain*
Lv.7-Simoon***                         Lv.23-Leech Power*
Lv.9-Blunt**                           Lv.28-Blizzard***
Lv.10-Weaken**                         Lv.33-Sirocco*****
Lv.12-Iceblast****                     Lv.37-Myollnir*****
Lv.13-Slow**

  !!!!!!
E.!Momo!
  !!!!!!

Difficulty for character- Easy: Through the utter abuse of Momo's stat
boosting spells, any difficulty that had or might have existed in this
challenge no longer does. It's really that easy, barring her low accuracy
which tends to make a Momo SCC long.

"Absolute Power! Too bad she can't hit the broad side of a barn...": Momo's
weapons give her an obscenely high attack value which you would think is good.
Unfortunately, Momo's accuracy is too low to take advantage of that...

"... so good thing for the Artemis' Cap!": Fortunately, this somewhat makes
up for Momo's accuracy defiency, at the cost of an accessory slot. It isn't so
bad though because you gain that much more power in exchange.

"Feel the earth's fury!": Sorry for a cheesy Grandia battle quote, but this
is called for here. Momo may have an outstanding attack, but she still needs
an attack to hit multiple enemies. Quake fits this role nicely. It may not be
the strongest of magic attacks and may not hit flying enemies, but it's the
best you can do, unless you want to wait for Ragnarok.

"POW! Hahaha! I hit you for more damage than I would normally... what? I
didn't? I can't?... crap.": Momo can't make critical hits. This I find
particularly enraging. It's no big deal considering her high attack power, but
it would still be nice...

"Stat Booster Heaven!": Momo has all of the statistic boosting magic she'll
need, except for Barrier. Protect, Speed, and Might can really make the
difference in a battle between being killed and annihilating your opponent.
These spells can compensate for Momo's somewhat average stats in the Defense
and Agility categories.  

"Less useless and all useful healing magic!": Like Ryu, Momo has a large
stock of healing magic. Unlike Ryu though, she doesn't have all the healing
magic. Fortunately, all the healing magic she doesn't have that Ryu does is
magic that would be useless to the SCC. She still keeps Heal, Purify,
Rejuvenate, Remedy, and Restore, all she'll need for the SCC.

"Looooooooooooooooooong battles": Momo's low accuracy will sometimes lead
to exceedingly long battles. It's more irritating than anything else.

"Status effects on enemies... heh heh": I don't know how useful you'll find
Momo's status attacks, as their accuracy isn't very dependable. There are
situations where they are useful, but it's usually much simpler to just kill
off the enemies rather than toy with them through Momo's status attacks.

"Sleep Chain": Now, I'm not sure exactly how many enemies this will actually
work on, but it is a convenient little maneuver whenever it works. Basically,
first you cast Sleep to put enemies to Sleep and then you attack them with
Sleep Shells equipped. After you hit the enemy (you always hit sleeping
enemies), the enemy will continue to stay asleep... usually.

Summary of Pros and Cons

Pros
High Power, AP, and Intellgence
Useful Statistic Boosting Spells
Useful Healing Magic
Powerful Attack Magic
"Sleep Chain"

Cons
Low Accuracy (Artemis' Cap for Compensation)
No Critical Hits
Powerful Attack Magic Learned Late in the Game
Mediocre HP, Defense, and Agility

Spells:
Start-Heal***                          Lv.17-Speed*****
Start-Purify**                         Lv.18-Rejuvenate****
Start-Identify*                        Lv.20-Might*****
Start-Foretell*                        Lv.24-Remedy**
Start-Protect*****                     Lv.27-Raise Dead*
Start-Silence**                        Lv.29-Ragnarok****
Lv.12-Sleep***                         Lv.33-Vitalize*

                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Section #5- Mini-Walkthrough
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Originally, I had planned this guide to cover only the boss strategies and
mention a few other things on the side. However, I am now expanding the guide
to much more than that starting in the version following version 4.0.

Notes: 
a) Under "Attacks", attack will not be mentioned because
just about every enemy has one.
b) The few exceptions to the SCC Rules will be
marked as EXCEPTION.
c) Vitamins is the party healing item, but Vitamin(s) is
my way of signifying multiples of the classic single character healing item 
that can be bought in almost any shop.
d) If a comment of mine has the same name as a spell, then my comment will be
in lower case and the spell name in upper case.
e) The bosses will be listed, of course, in chronological order.
f) These symbols will show character availability in an area:
 (#): The "number" symbol means that a character can be in the party out of
      choice at some time while you're in this area..
 (!): The "exclamation point" signifies that a character must be in the
      party at some time while you're in this area. Obviously Ryu will have
      an (!) at almost all times.
 (X): The "X" signifies that a character is still in your group but cannot be
      in your party at some time while you're in this area.
 (+): The "plus" sign means that a character is gained atsome time when you're
      in that area.
 (-): The "minus" sign means that a character is gained atsome time when
      you're in that area.
 The latter 2 symbols will also signify stall points for some characters.
 Also, these symbols are meant to tell you who you can have in your party. You
 still need to keep your SCC character in the party at all times whenever
 possible.
g) I don't expect people to read my boring comments saying, "Proceed with the
story," or something like that. Usually, you'll just see a one-liner under an
area if it does that. If there's more than that, then I suggest you read it. I
just say that when I don't really have much to say about that area in relation
to the SCC. When I do have something relevant to the SCC, I probably won't
make any comments pertaining to the plot at all. I only put something
related to the plot under a title because... >_> <_< I don't really have
much to say about that area pertaining to the SCC.
h) Places with a "?" for a name will be given a suitable, yet recognizable
name. Why this note? I don't want some idiot e-mailing me saying, "Well, I
don't remember any place like that on the map."
i) I won't comment about every item along the way, only the important [and
usually vital] ones. I STILL ADVISE YOU TO ACQUIRE EVERY ITEM IN A LEVEL!
j) Comments such as "buy equipment for him" or "do this with her" apply only
to the SCC unless otherwise noted by me.
k) This walkthrough will only cover the "Primary" SCCs. Contributor work on
"Secondary" SCCs are in the section "Secondary" SCCs.

                        ------------------------------

----------
Dauna Mine
----------

!+Ryu+!

Not much to do here. Just fry the workers with Whelp Breath as you go. You
can pick up the Melted Blade if you like, but it's really not necessary.

-----------
Cedar Woods
-----------

!Ryu!

Just head to town. There aren't any particularly important items to pick up
at the moment.

-----------
McNeil/Farm
-----------

!Ryu!
!+Teepo+!
!+Rei+!

You know the deal. You get Teepo and Rei, and then you go to Yrall Road.

----------
Yrall Road
----------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!Rei!

You finally enter your first combat situation here. As Ryu and Teepo are at
only Lv.1, combat will be difficult for them for a little while (esp. for
Ryu). You might want to stick with Defense formation for them. 

Ryu and Teepo SCCers, put Rei's equipment on Ryu/Teepo until you get
better stuff.

Rei should do just fine at Lv.5.

-----------
Cedar Woods
-----------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!-Rei-!

Again, nothing out of the ordinary. You just lose Rei until the fight with
the Nue. Rei SCCers, be careful until you get him back.

----------------
Road to Mt.Glaus
----------------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!

There's one particular item here whose importance I cannot emphasize enough:
the Coin. Get the Coin. It should definitely help out most of you allot.

Be careful when tangling with the Man Traps.

--------
Mt.Glaus
--------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!+Rei+!

Before you go fight the Nue, there are several things you might want to do.
First, build up a high zenny supply. Next, buy the basic fishing supplies in
McNeil. Then, go fishing for battle and trading purposes. Finally, trade for
a Silver Knife at the Manillo shop and buy the best equipment (except the
Bronze Sword and Cloth Shield) in McNeil. Rreturn to Mt.Glaus and pick up
the Cloth Shield and Heavy Caro along the way.

I.Nue (1st fight)
-HP~140
-Attacks: Nue Stomp
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 8 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor 
-The Nue runs away a few turns after beginning of the battle. Just attack
 her until then.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 7
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor
-Physically attack the Nue until she flees.

Just pursue the Nue into the caves.

II.Nue
-HP~280
-Attacks: Nue Stomp, Jolt, (moderate counter rate)
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 8
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-Cast Protect the first round to limit the damage from her physical blows
 and Nue Stomp. Just attack and use Heal or Healing Herbs. Keep your HP at
 least at 20 before deciding to attack because her one-use Jolt takes off 
 12. After that, she runs of AP and wastes most of his turns unsuccessfully
 trying to cast another Jolt.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 8
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-Simoon the beast to defeat.

-----------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!Rei!

Head to McNeil.

-----------
McNeil/Farm

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!Rei!

More story sequences. Stock up on healing items and anything else you think
you'll need for the next stage and speak to Loki in the shack to head off to
McNeil Manor.

------------
McNeil Manor
------------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!-Rei-!

Take care of the guards' problems and what not until you finally have to deal
with that guard dog...

III.Pooch
-HP~250
-Attacks: Snap
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-Cast Protect because his physical attacks are strong. Other than that,
 attack him and use Healing Herbs when needed. Put Protect up again if his
 Snap lowers your defense.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 8
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman

Just continue dealing with the guards until you reach a certain chicken...

IV.Rocky
-HP~270
-Attacks: Ovum, Jump
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-EXCEPTION: Because Rocky uses Ovum so often, you are allowed to use all
 3 party members. This should make the battle as easy as pie.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 8
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-EXCEPTION: Because Rocky uses Ovum so often, you are allowed to use all
 3 party members. This should make the battle as easy as pie.
-5 Simoons should subdue this wild rooster.

Continue with the story to reach the mansion.

--------------
McNeil Mansion
--------------

!Ryu!
!Teepo!
!+Rei+!

Again, for those of you who chose Rei, be careful around here until you get
him back. As for you Ryu and Teepo SCCers, you should be fine. 

Nothing too virulent in here except maybe for Jump from a Roach. For much 
of here on in though, *turns on Ghostbuster music*, it's ghostbusting time! 

V.Torast
-HP~120
-Attacks: Sleep
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-This can be annoying. He always uses Sleep or attacks, both of which are
 dangerous. Keep trying to cast Protect until you can finally get one in.
 Then attack and Heal when necessary.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 9
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-A pair of ordinary attacks should cut down the fifth McNeil.

VI.Kassen
-HP~55
-Attacks: Leech Power
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-Kill him quickly with regular attacks because he uses Leech Power. Don't
 bother casting Protect; his attacks do negligible damage.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 9
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-Again, a pair of attacks defeats the third McNeil.

VII.Galtel
-HP~150
-Attacks: Blunt, Weaken
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-He just uses status decreasing spells and regular attacks. Finish him
 quickly because Blunt and Weaken could lengthen the battle a bit.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 9
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-*sigh* This becoming repetitive. You guessed it: 2 attacks to defeat the
 12th McNeil.

VIII.Doksen
-HP~140
-Attacks: Heal, (high counter rate)
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 9 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-The only thing this McNeil has going for him is a high reprisal rate.
 Cast Protect and then just hack away at him.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 9
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather
 Armor, Talisman
-OK, now I'm convinced these ghosts are just trying to die!... er... lose!
 The eighth McNeil even casts Heal on you while you pummel him to oblivion.

Use the rest point before you go onto the roof to meet Rei. Then, prepare to
bust the biggest, baddest ghost of them all (Don't worry; that's the last of
my cheesy Ghostbuster jokes).

IX.Amalgam
-HP~550
-Attacks: Astral Warp, Flare, Frost, Sleep
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 11 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-Flare, Frost, and his regular attacks all do around 10-20 damage, and Astral
 Warp can nearly do 30. Not to mention that he loves using Sleep. Put up
 at least 2 or 3 Protects to guard versus Astral Warp and pray for Ryu to
 counter. Cast Rejuvenate or use Healing Herbs when Ryu falls below half
 his max HP. Whenever you're in good shape, attack. Note: Attack Formation
 may be a little too daring for this battle. If you're having too much
 trouble, switch to Defense.
B.Teepo
-Recommended Level: 10
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
 Armor, Talisman
-The absolutely safest way to win this battle is to use a Healing Herb when
 your HP is below three-fourths and attack every other opportunity you get.

Head into town.

If you have any shopping you want to, now would be the time to do it. This
will be your last opportunity to shop for a while, so take advantage of it.

Remove all of Teepo's and Rei's equipment and replace their weapons with
Daggers all before you reach the area with your house in it.

X.Balio and Sunder (1st fight)
-Outside Treehouse in Cedar Woods
-HP=Infinite
-Attacks: Lightning
A.Ryu (I am not even going to bother)
-Prepare to be annihilated.
B.Teepo
-Congratulations for finishing the Teepo SCC. It ends here. If you wish to
 continue on another SCC, disequip Teepo's equipment prior to the battle.

If you were doing a Teepo or Rei SCC, your Ryu is probably very weak right
now. It's suggested you power him up a little bit to survive Mt.Myrneg.

---------
Mt.Myrneg

!Ryu!

The enemies can be quite difficult, even deadly. Only fight the enemies
if you're confident you can win. Otherwise, run.

---------------
Wyndian Dungeon
---------------

!Ryu!
!+Nina+!

First you've got to "save" Nina.

XI.Balio and Sunder (2nd fight)
-HP=???
-Attacks: Lightning
A.Ryu: (I am not even going to bother)
-There is supposedly a way to defeat them, but that method requires an 
 insane amount of powering up which might deprive you of the challenges in 
 the rest of the game. If you really want to beat them, then go ahead, but 
 I'm probably not going to post anything on it unless demand is ENORMOUS.

YEA! You got Nina! If you don't plan on SCCing with Nina, take off all her
equipment, especially that Soul Gem. If you do plan on using her... take off
the Soul Gem anyway >_> <_<... and welcome to heck as the torturing trial that
is the Nina SCC begins.

The Volt and Thunder combination can be quite deadly in combat. If you
encounter them together, my advice is: RUN LIKE MAD!

Just pick up the Light Bangle by solving the "number" puzzle. Don't forget
the Glass Domino either.

------
Wyndia
------

!Ryu!
!Nina!

After you find the children in the hide-and-seek game, stop by some of the
shops to stock up on stuff (You finally can again ^_^). For Ryu, prioritize
purchasing the Broad Sword (unless you have enough money for the Scramasax
in Genmel) but also try to get the Cuirass. For Nina, buy the Mage's Robes
and Mace (again, unless you have enough money for the Magician's Rod in
Genmel).

------------
Eygnock Road
------------

!Ryu!
!Nina!

Now you're captured by Balio and Sunder and sent to Genmel.

------
Genmel
------

!Ryu!
!Nina!

Depending on your purchases in Wyndia which was based off of your financial
situation, you may need to buy either the Scramasax for Ryu or the Magician's
Rod for Nina.

----------
Mt.Boumore
----------

!Ryu!
!Nina!

It is absolutely imperative that you pick up the Buckler while you're here.
The sheer amount of help it will provide you with cannot be emphasized enough.
Once you reach the other side of the mountain, beware of the Orcs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forest by the side of Mt.Boumore in Eastern Wyndia (wordiest title ever)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

!Ryu!
!Nina!

Remember to pick up the Reverse gene for Ryu here.

Before you proceed to the Tower, stop by the fishing spot. Trade for a Crepe
Cape for Nina or Momo, and catch lots and lots of Black Porgy. 

-----
Tower
-----

!Ryu!
!Nina!
!+Momo+!

There's a main room attached to a another room with a bed and a save point.

This is a pretty good spot to power up. The Ice Toads, Orcs, and
assortment of bots are pretty good for experience at this point in the game.
Come back if you need to power up harder SCC characters. The Ice Toads and
Orcs have some powerful attacks (e.g. Ice Breath), so save frequently. The 
ability to recover and save very quickly really helps.

Put simply, Momo is pretty bad when you first acquire her. She can't hit
the broad side of a barn, and she has no attack spells. My suggestion would be
that if you're doing a Momo SCC, until you either get Quake or an Artemis'
Cap, run from combat.

There's a bunch of great stuff to pick up here too. Rather than list it all
though, I'll just say this: GET EVERYTHING! Trust me; you'll regret it if you
don't.

For Momo, you really must pick up the Artemis' Cap or condemn her to eternal
misses. Really, that accessory is her only hope...

XII.Mutant
-HP~550
-Attacks: Dream Breath, Venom Breath
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 17 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Rec. Equip.: Broad Sword, Buckler, Glass Domino, Breastplate, Talisman, 
 Light Bangle
-The Light Bangle should provide protection against his Dream and Venom
 Breaths. Put up 1 or 2 Protects to provide protection until his 
 regeneration runs out, while using Healing Herbs when necessary. Once he 
 stops regenerating HP, transform into a Defender Flame Dragon. His 
 susceptibility to Flame should cause Flame Breath to do 100+ damage per 
 turn.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 20
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler,
 Glass Domino, Mage's Robes, High Boots, Light Bangle
-The level may seem a bit high, but believe me when I say you'll need it;
 it'll get you oriented with "Nina boss warfare". The motto: "spend more
 time powering up than there are hours in the day." Anyway, Nina's first
 boss is relatively easy. You can withstand 3 direct attacks before death
 via the 4th. If any status attacks get by the Light Bangle, for sleep
 wait to be hit or wake up automatically and for poison use an Antidote.
 Use Healing Herbs/Vitamin(s) when your HP drops to critical. Finally, for
 offense, use the trusty Simoon (he is a plant, so it would make sense that
 he's weak against fire).
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 17
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Flame Chrysm, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape,
 Artemis' Cap, Light Bangle
-Put up a few Protects, followed by a couple Speeds (for the EX turn). Cast
 Heal when needed, but otherwise annihilate him with your attack.

Make sure you're done with all you want to do before you go to Genmel, esp.
powering up because the enemies around Genmel don't provide the amount of exp.
you'd probably need.

YEA! You've got Peco! He doesn't start out with much at all, and powering up
at the beginning is going to be a struggle for you Peco SCCers, but you'll be
fine once you get further in... I think... >_> <_<

For Ryu, pick up a Claymore, Knight's Helmet, and, if you have enough money,
left over, a Scale Mail all at the shops.

If you're low on zenny, head over to the thieves' hut with Peco, get the
Flower Jewel, and then sell it (it's not as if you'll be needing it for
Meryleep anyway). Don't forget the Wisdom Fruit there either. 

XIII.Claw (or Dodai)
-HP~250
-Attacks: Blind, Double Blow
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 18

-Put up a Protect and hammer away at him physically. Use Eye Drops if Blind
 works and Healing Herbs if he actually does a good amount of damage to you.
D.Nina
-You could try to beat the entire Patrio team, but why? It'll be 
 considerably easier to take out the Dodai under Claw and just be done with 
 this round of the Contest.
E.Momo
-Again, it's just so much easier to go for the team's Dodai.

 weak physical attacks. Attack him regularly, and he'll be toast in a couple

-All this guy can do is attack and have a high critical hit rate. Instead of
 worrying about your HP, just transform into a Flame Defender Dragon. A few
 attacks from your dragon should annihilate him.

XVI.Dodai
-HP~2100
-Attacks: (none, not even a standard attack)
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 18 
-Recommended Formation: Normal 
-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail, 
 Talisman, Light Bangle
-This is an alternate strategy you can take should you choose not to fight
 Claw, Cawer, and Patrio. Transform into a Frost Whelp (via Flame + Reverse)
 and use Frost Claw on it until it collapses into the lava.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 20 
-Recommended Formation: Normal 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler, Glass Domino, Mage's Robes, 
 High Boots, Light Bangle
-Claw will attack your Dodai, you will Iceblast his Dodai, and he won't even 
 do half the damage to your Dodai as you will to his via continuous 
 Iceblasts. Game, set, and match (literally).
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 17
-Recommended Formation: Normal
-Recommended Equipment: Ice Chrysm, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape,

-Put up a couple Protects around your own Dodai and pound away at the Patrio
 team's. Use a MultiVitamin on your own Dodai if it starts to sink.

Rest and Save after the first round of the tournament.

XVII.Emitai + 2 Golems
-Emitai: HP~600
         Attacks: (none, not even a standard attack)
-Golem: HP~750
        Attacks: Spirit Blast
A.Ryu: 
-Recommended Level: 18 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail, 
 Talisman, Light Bangle
-Method 1: Golems Go First: This is incredibly hard. You don't stand a
 chance as ordinary Ryu. A few Spirit Blasts from the Golems would kill him
 pretty quickly. At least Emitai does nothing. Transform into a Defender
 Flame Dragon and focus your attacks on one of the Golems. Once the dragon
 dies, use a Wisdom Fruit and transform again. Once the first Golem dies,
 the fight should ease up a bit. Eventually, the second Golem will fall. If
 your form is broken again, use a couple Protects and battle the final Golem
 normally. Then just finish the defending Emitai to win!
-Method 2: Emitai Goes First: If you can eliminate Emitai first, then the
 Golems will attack each other. As a Defender Flame Dragon, your attacks 
 will do more damage, but he's still defending, you're inflicting less 
 damage, and the Golems are pounding on Ryu. If you can get Emitai out of 
 the battle, the remainder is pie.
-Note: Both methods will be a little (relatively) difficult to pull off. 
 It's your call, but I did it using Method 1.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 22 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Bracers, Bandana, Mage's Robes, 
 High Boots, Soul Gem
-Let me try to put this subtly. You must fulfill the minimum requirements to
 win this fight. If you do, you can win; if you don't, you will lose. By
 sacrificing a small amount of defense for agility, you get the EX turn 
 which you must have to win this fight. Otherwise, you'd have to heal every 
 turn to live. The strategy is simple: alternate between attack Emitai and 
 use Vitamin. Once Emitai falls, the Golems will attack each other. Finally, 
 one of the Golems will die from the other's attacks, and you need only to 
 finish off the near-dead remaining one.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 19
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ammo, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, Artemis'
 Cap, High Boots
-Your first target is Emitai cowering in the back. Alternate between
 attacking him and healing via Vitamin(s) (maybe 2 attacks then Vitamin if
 you have enough remaining HP to survive another round with the killer
 Golems). If you are plan on using a Vitamin, you should have about +30 HP
 left. If you are going to attack, you should have about +60 HP remaining.
 Why? The Golems inflict at most around 35 HP in damage a turn (26 maximum
 from Spirit Blast and around 10 maximum from an ordinary attack). When you
 try to use a Vitamin, you will act after one of the Golems acts. Once
 Emitai falls, wait while Pantson and Fire battle each other. As soon as
 one Golem is defeated, slay the victor.

Again, rest and save, though it won't matter for the next battle.

Now you get Garr, I'd advise robbing him of his worthwhile equipment in the

A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 18 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail, 
 Talisman, Light Bangle
-As soon as the battle begins, steal Garr's Scale Mail (if you don't already
 have one) and his Titan Belt (equip it in place of the Talisman). Put up
 several Protects, and you'll be set. Just attack him and Rejuvenate. He's
 pretty easy.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 22 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler, Glass Domino, Mage's Robes, 
 High Boots, Soul Gem
-Yes, that's right, Attack Formation. I would say Defense Formation, but he 
 casts Barrier first turn and makes Nina's magic damage weaker than her 
 physical damage. Emphasize her physical power even further by stealing
 Garr's Titan Belt and equipping it on Nina to replace the Soul Gem. Nina
 will do 60 to mid-80s in damage! Attack him every turn with this exception:
 *always* heal when Nina's HP at 52 or 53 or below because Stallion's 
 physical attack could kill you. Don't worry about his other attacks: Jolt 
 (I laugh at its negligible damage), Utmost Attack (decent damage but 
 nothing to worry about), and Resist (this is funny: Nina is faster than 
 Stallion and always moves first, but Resist only works during the turn it's 
 used; otherwise, he just wasted a turn; he might as well have used Bad 
 Back!). He's really not as hard as you think.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 20
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Ammo, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, Artemis'
 Cap, High Boots
-The depleted AP from the last battle shouldn't concern you. Momo has more
 than enough left in her to wipe the floor with the unmighty steed. First,
 steal Garr's Titan Belt and equip it in place of the High Boots. Fill back
 the lost HP. Then a few Protects, a pair of Speeds, and a few Mights should
 give you the EX turn, a durable Momo, and a potential +300 damage per
 attack! Need I say more?

A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 20 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail, 
 Titan Belt, Light Bangle
-This battle's easy, but, if Ryu is at full AP, it's even easier.
 Transform into Trygon and do nothing but attack. Eye Beam rarely hits, 
 Hynoptize is useless against you (I've always hit him, even under 
 confusion), and his physical attack does negligible damage. You should be 
 able to defeat him with the amount of AP you have without reverting.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 23 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, 
 High Boots, Light Bangle
-Start the battle by casting Blunt to reduce his attack power. Then cast
 Simoon on him every turn you can. His Eye Beam can take off over one-half
 your HP, so always keep it above 50. If he Hypnotizes you, he could
 potentially kill you. If you're worried about this, switch out the High
 Boots for you Soul Gem (but you might want to save it for later...).
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 21
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ammo, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, Artemis'

-Gazer's not so tough... >_> <_< except for that whole Eye Beam attack that
 nearly does half of Momo's HP in damage. Seriously though, all you need is a
 few Mights, a couple Protects, and a Speed, and you'll be fine. Just
 Rejuvenate when your HP drops below half and otherwise blow him away.

-Recommended Level: 21

-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail,

-Transform into an Eldritch Thunder Dragon. Then attempt Myollinir 4 
 consecutive times, and, if successful, you should do 1000+ damage. If
 Intimidate stops you from getting in all 4, use a Thunder Claw instead.
 If he's still alive, he's on the verge of death. Use whatever AP you have
 left (after you revert) to put up some Protects (use a Rainbow Trout/
 Sea Bream if you need to) and finish him off with ordinary attacks.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 24 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, 
 High Boots, Soul Gem
-He's big, he's mean, he's powerful, and he's really fast. Even at level 24,
 Nina splits "who goes first" with the Dolphin about 50/50. His ordinary
 attacks can do more than one-third of Nina's HP gauge as well. Fortunately,
 he frequently gets nothing out of his turn when he casts the inaccurate
 Tsunami or Intimidate which also misses often or hits after Nina has gone
 (thus demonstrating the attack's lack of value). The battle is definitely
 still not in the bag though. In fact, due to its unpredictability, I
 recommend the long, safe path. Alternate between Lightning and Healing 
 Herb/Vitamin every turn (only heal if you have sustained serious damage the
 previous turn) for an assured victory.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 22
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ammo, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, Artemis'

-*sigh* Dolphin is just too easy. After a Speed and quartets of Mights and
 Protects, obliterating this fish... er... mammal with your gun should be
 a walk through the tulips. The only thing you possibly need to be concerned
 about is recovering HP should it near 1/4.

-Recommended Equipment: Claymore, Buckler, Knight's Helmet, Scale Mail, 
 Ring of Fire, Light Bangle
-You could transform into a Flame Behemoth and defeat them that way, but it
 could take much longer than my suggestion. Instead, transform into a Frost
 Behemoth and get in a couple Frost Breaths before Walls of Fire combined
 with Gisshan's status attacks bridle their effectiveness. Then Frost Claw
 each of the lava beasts and Blitz Gisshan.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 25 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape, 
 Ring of Fire, Light Bangle/Soul Gem
-Wow. This is probably the hardest fight yet. Whether or not you win this
 battle is primarily luck. You must kill Charyb and Scylla quickly. If Snap
 lowers your defense too much, you don't stand a chance against the two lava
 beasts' physical attacks. Just hope they use Wall of Fire to heal you as
 much as possible. Not to mention Gisshan; pray he defends most of the 
 battle rather than use his repertoire of annoying spells. Focus your 
 Iceblasts on one of the fiery monsters at a time, don't let your HP drop 
 below one-half without healing, and, if necessary, sacrifice your Soul Gem 
 if your defense gets too butchered by Snap. That way, you'll recover the 
 lost defense.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 24
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ice Chrysm, Buckler, Glass Domino, Crepe Cape,

-Your initial concern should be to get a few Protectors for safety. Follow with
 a pair of Speeds for an EX turn. Before attacking though, add the usual few
 Mights. With your bariers installed (or even while you're installing them;
 this battle's still easy unless you're very unlucky), you can take out those
 lava snakes. With their weakness to Frost elemental attacks and those Mights,
 you should easily infict 300+ damage per hit. After you send Charyb and
 Scylla to that by big volcano in the sky, switch Ice Chrysm and Ring of Fire
 for Ammo and Titan Belt. Knock off the old man and cliam victory!

Just be sure you're ready before you fight Mikba. He can be extremely
difficult, so be sure you have enough items to survive, particularly HP and
AP restoratives and (I suppose) Antidotes.

Rei sure had a long stall point. It reminds me of a character from another
game... *coughShadowcough*. It's a shame you couldn't power him up for this
fight. Hopefully, you'll defeat Mikba... >_> <_<

A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 28 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Party: Rei, Nina 
-Recommended Equipment: Barbarossa, Steel Gauntlets, Knight's Helmet, Scale
 Mail, Titan Belt, Light Bangle
-EXCEPTION: Revive Rei when the battle begins via Ammonia from Nina (Rei 
 won't transform with 1 HP), then immediately lighten Ryu's equipment and 
 transform into the Tiger Hybrid (you might get the EX turn). Keep using 
 Shadowalk until you are forced to revert. Then re-equip the recommended
 equipment for this battle. Use any remaining AP to put up a Protect to 
 guard against his strong physical attack. He has both a high critical hit
 rate and high counter rate making this battle a little delicate. For
 safety's sake, rotate your actions by attacking one turn and using a
 Vitamin the next.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 26 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Steel Gauntlets, Gold Hairpin, Crepe 
 Cape, Light Bangle, Soul Gem
-*sigh* ...another hard and long battle. Mikba can easily remove one-half
 of your HP in a Lucky Strike (highest he did to me was around
 four-fifths!), so always heal around two-thirds your maximum. As if that
 wasn't enough, though Nina is usually faster than Mikba, Mikba has a habit
 of moving before Nina in the critical turns (e.g. healing turns), so,
 whenever you heal, switch to a lighter weapon for an agility boost, heal,
 and then switch back to the Magician Rod. The most important thing to
 remember in this battle is to *never physically attack him*; that provokes
 a reprisal Lucky Strike and then his attack for that turn, which will
 likely kill you. Your only option then is magic; here it is Iceblast.
 Though you'll get your usual intelligence boost from the Magician Rod,
 you'll still need to hit Mikba with... oh... about 50! Yeah, I know,
 that's allot, but hopefully you have at least 5 remaining Black Porgy or
 equivalent AP restoratives (A Wisdom Fruit could do the job, but they are
 still pretty uncommon until you establish a copy shop, so...). The main
 problem here is finding an opportunity to hit this guy. Hopefully, he'll
 waste most of his turns using Resist (after Nina's already attacked, heh
 heh), and Venom Breath (switch Light Bangle for High Boots if you become
 poisoned; don't even bother to heal it); usually though he uses Quake,
 Multistrike and [the very dangerous] Lucky Strike. The Soul Gem should
 help a little and provide some leeway, but this is still a draining fight.
 It's still doable however.

Pick up the Deluxe Rod before you go. This should certainly be an
improvement from that Bamboo Rod you've been using up until now.

-Yet again, there's no mercy for poor Nina. As usual her opponent's regular
 attacks can do one-third to more than two-thirds Nina's total HP. There's a
 twist to this fight though: using Syphon, he can recover around one-half
 the damage you averagely inflict with your best attack/spell while damaging
 you simultaneously! Simoon the slug whenever possible and (though risky for
 your life and Soul Gem) recover yourself when your HP falls to mid-50s.
 Once you have consumed all your AP, switch the Magician Rod for the
 Windcutter and Soul Gem for Titan Belt. These extra boosts in power should
 cause your attack to inflict more damage to him than his frequent Syphons
 can recover. Without the Soul Gem though, you can't risk your life anymore,
 so heal yourself in the mid-60 HP area. Obviously, alternate attacking and
 healing (you *did* switch to power equipment after all). You'll be sure
 he's near death when he begins casting Quake. Being the easiest part of the
 battle, he shouldn't really be an obstacle from this point on (especiallly
 when he runs out of AP and continues to try to unsuccessfully cast Quake).
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 26
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Flame Chrysm, Steel Gauntlets, Gold Hairpin, Silver
 Mail, Artemis' Cap, High Boots
-His original attack can knock off nearly half your HP, so put up 3 or 4
 Protects immediately while healing inbetween. Follow up with 4 Mights. Next,
 switch your High Boots for a Titan Belt and then whack him for almost 400
 damage. Rejuvenate when required.

XXX.Shroom
-HP~3000
-Attacks: Head Cracker, Ragnarok, Lavaburst, Blitz, Restore
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 30
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Party: Peco, Momo
-Recommended Equipment: Barbarossa, Steel Gauntlets, Knight's Helmet, Silver
 Mail, Titan Belt, Ivory Charm
-Transform into a Knight Hybrid and use Combustion on him until he dies.
D.Nina 
-Recommended Level: 33 
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Magician Rod, Steel Gauntlets, Gold Hairpin,
 AmberB Plate, Soul Gem, Wisdom Ring 
-Due to the AmberB Plate and Wisdom Ring, victory is now attainable (as
 opposed to before when a Head Cracker would instantly kill the Wyndian
 princess). Again, use the Soul Gem as a net. Your attack pattern is simple:
 Iceblast at lowest 80+ HP and heal at below 80 HP. Don't worry about his
 relentless Restores because *eventually* he'll run out of AP, won't be able
 to cast anything, and will waste nearly one-half of his turns in vain
 attempts. Just adhere to the pattern, only deviating from it to recover AP
 via Black Porgies. For his finale, he'll try a useless last ditch effort to
 stop you with Blitzes.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 27
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Sleep Shells, Steel Gauntlets, Gold Hairpin, Light
 Clothing, Artemis' Cap, Soul Gem
-At the start of this battle, your chief worry should be keeping your HP above
 75 *at all times* and casting 4 Speeds. The former of the two should actually
 be a guideline for the entire battle as Headcracker can be devastating. Next,
 cast 4 Protects and Mights. Attack him for 200+ damage as he vainly tries
 Restoring his waning HP back.

Among the important items here are the Protectors, Wisdom Fruit, Flash
Shells, and Soul Gem (NOTE: some of these you may have access to thanks to the
Faerie Village).

The Giant Crabs in the back of the ship know Death, so feel free to run from
them.

Solve several puzzles and keep on journeying through the ship until you
reach the Ammonites. Be very careful before you enter battle with them. You
haven't had access to a save point since you first crashed into the ship, and
it would be a shame to lose all that work so close to the end of this stage.

XXXIII.2 Ammonites
-HP~2500 each
-Attacks: Tsunami, Iceblast, Blizzard, Multistrike
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 33 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Barbarossa, Ice Shield, Knight's Helmet, Blizzard 
 Mail, Titan Belt, Ivory Charm
-Transform into a Mammoth and use a few Meteor Strikes to take these 2 down.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 35
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Protectors, Laurel, AmberB Plate, Soul
 Gem, Wisdom Ring
-This fight can become a little nerve-racking, especially because these 2
 fish can theoretically kil you in any one given turn (2x 3 hits from
 Multistrike). Fortunately, the odds of such a disaster ocurring are quite
 low, plus you have 2 Soul Gems should it happen. Lightning is your most
 effective attack (They are fish after all!), but you should only Lightning
 with at least one-half your maximum HP. The goofs squander many of their
 turns casting missing Tsunamis, guarded Confuses, and measly 1 hit
 Multistrikes. They can be dangerous on a roll though, so don't hesitate to
 heal often and, when you do, temporarily exchange Ouroboros and Wisdom Ring
 for the lighter Oaken Staff and Speed Boots to give you the initiative move
 that round. Continue healing until you find an opportunity to charge, then
 switch back your equipment and go at them again!
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 27
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Flash Shells, Protectors, Laurel, Silver Mail, Speed
 Boots, Light Bangle
-The first 4 Protects here are key. Without them, they could theoretically
 instantaneously kill you at any time with 6 Multistrike hits (Fortunately,
 the odds of this happening is very low). Of course, Rejuvenate inbetween when
 your HP falls too low. Next, cast a couple Speeds followed by 4 Mights.
 Replace your Speed Boots with Artemis' Cap and hack away! Also, note that
 they are susceptible to both Sleep and Silence, so... you could try it if you
 like... but I wouldn't risk toying with them. Blizzard and Iceblast could kill
 you if you become careless. Just kill them quickly.

A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 36 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Damascus Sword, Laquer Shield, UV Glasses, Damascus
 Mail, Titan Belt, Ivory Charm
-Wow. This guy's strong. His devastatingly strong physical and magical
 attacks force you to put up some defenses. Worst of all, you can't 
 transform. Oh well, that just leaves your base form. Alternate between 
 Protect and Barriers (more Protects than Barriers) while casting Restore
 and using Vitamin(s). Once you're well enough fortified, start attacking
 and healing any damage he inflicts. The only advantage you have in this
 fight is that he so frequently uses Bad Back, wasting a turn.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 38
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, UV Glasses, Sage's
 Frock, Ring of Fire, Thunder Ring
-Considering he wastes a good number of his turns via Bad Back and that you
 now absorb one-half of his total number of attacks, this shouldn't be too
 hard. Except when he successfully attacks physically (in which case you
 heal), just keep zapping him with Myollnir turn after turn and restore AP
 through several Black Porgies when you deplete your AP supply.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 34
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: AP Shells, Steel Gauntlets, UV Glasses, Sage's Frock,
 Artemis' Cap, Speed Boots
-This battle will be a breeze. A couple Speeds will bring the EX turn.; then
 use the usual quadruple Protects and Mights and annihilate him. All you need
 to do is keep your HP above 100 (Myollnir = death below 100 HP).

The Egg Gangs and Gold Eggs are deadly enemies. If they successfully hit

Allot of the enemies here can be quite dangerous, so be careful.

XXXVI.Chimera
-HP~7500
-Attacks: Paralyzer, Myollnir, Blizzard, Restore
-EXCEPTION: Due to Paralyzer which paralyzes your SCC character, probably has
 a 99% chance of being used, has a never-ending effect until remedied,
 therefore ends the battle (that is, you lose), and, most importantly, cannot
 be blocked, you must keep 2 other party members alive. These are the
 conditions: 1)They can Panacea/Remedy the SCC character; 2)They can do
 anything to themselves; 3)To SCC character, they cannot do anything else at
 all (except Panacea); 4)They can in no way attack Chimera whatsoevere;
 5)Other than in the forementioned cases, they may in no way directly
 influence the battle; 6)If the SCC character dies, then you have lost, the
 remaining characters are not permitted to interfere. I'm simply trying to
 keep this remotely legitimate. Any charcters labeled with "EXCEPTION" for
 this boss may follow these guidelines.
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 43
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Protectors, Sun Mask, Life Armor, Ivory
 Charm, Titan Belt
-Strangely enough, Chimera has an inclination towards using Myollnir, so
 a Thunder Behemoth (throw in Thorn if you're still concerned) should be 
 enough for this battle. Just attack him regularly (if you add Thorn, Blitz
 him a few times because you'll absorb his Myollnirs).
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 42
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, UV Glasses, Sage's
 Sage's Frock, Speed Boots, Wisdom Ring
-EXCEPTION: Myollnir him through this battle. Use Black Porgies when you've
 consumed all your AP and use a Vitamin if AP is below 110 or MultiVitamin
 if HP is in critical. It's another long, hard battle, but the diverted
 fire should lower its difficulty a bit.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 42
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, UV Glasses, Holy Robe,
 Artemis' Cap, Ivory Charm
-EXCEPTION: 4 Protects, 4 Mights, and a few Speeds as usual followed by
 pounding typical 500+ damage holes in him should be enough to topple this
 beast. Other than the already handled Paralyzer, your only concern should be
 Myollnir and maybe Inferno. Even then, Ivory Charm blocks half the damage
 from them.

You'll need Momo and her HE Shells to destroy the plants around a door in
the lab.

You'll then need Rei to unlock the doors past the previously mentioned area.

Pick up the Silver Tiara before you proceed to Eden.

A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 46 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Protectors, Dragon Helmet, Life Armor,
 Ivory Charm, Titan Belt
-Teepo is incredibly strong. With the greatest of haste, transform into a
 Behemoth. Just keep attacking; you should do, at bare minimum, 600+ damage
 per attack (more likely around 800). Nonetheless, this battle is 
 surprisingly easy.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 49
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, Silver Tiara, Holy
 Robe, Ivory Charm, Soul Gem
-EXCEPTION: Without a breach of the rules, this battle is nearly impossible.
 Nina cannot survive Triple Blow; it usually only takes 2 of the hits to
 finish her. I've considered every possibility that I can think of, and
 nothing works. *If you can think of a good idea, tell me please.*
 Otherwise, you may break the Soul Gem limit up to a maximum of 25 (I needed
 20) with the following conditions: 1)The Soul Gem limit of 2 per battle
 applies to every death except from Triple Blow 2)Whatever their
 distribution is, the total number of used Soul Gems shall not exceed 25
 (otherwise, if the number of regular deaths to number of Triple Blow
 deaths (ratio), then, at maximums, 0 to 25, 1 to 24, or 2 to 23). I need to
 clearly delineate the rules to... prevent any *overly* unfair activity
 >_> <_<.
-Onto the boss strategy! As the Ivory Charm will greatly reduce the damage
 from his magic attacks as well as block status effects, Inferno (about 20),
 Blizzard (about 20), Sirroco (about 30), and Howling (blocked) would be the
 best attacks to be hit by. Unfortunately, Teepo prefers to smash you with
 his regular attack (95-140 OW!) and Triple Blow (60-90 per strike! Now you
 know why Nina can't live with her 173 max at level 49), so MultiVitamin
 after his regular attack or any time your HP falls below 140. Otherwise,
 just Myollnir every opportunity you get (I cast around 60 before I defeated
 him O_o) and use Wisdom Fruits when you've consumed all your AP.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 44
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, Silver Tiara, Force Armor,
 Soul Gem, Ivory Charm
-Before you ask about the wherebouts of the Artemis' Cap on that list of
 equipment, let me explain the Soul Gem first. Dragon Lord's Triple Blow is
 very deadly; even with all your equipment and powering up, it might very well
 kill you before you get your Protects up. The Soul Gem will provide you with
 insurance that you'll be able to continue with your Protects. That being said,
 cast them and now re-equip an Artemis' Cap. (I told you I'd get back to it.).
 Follow with a few Speeds and then 4 Mights. The combined work of your
 fortification spells and the Ivory Charm reduces most of Dragon Lord's
 "deadly attacks" to harmless scratches. All you have to do is attack him for
 400+ damage per turn and cast Heal when you're around 1/2 HP.

-------------------------
Myria Station: Final Area
-------------------------

!Ryu!
#Rei#
#Nina#
#Momo#
#Peco#
#Garr#

The enemies in this area are [probably] more deadly than anything else
you've fought before. Running would be a good idea if you encounter... almost
anything.

For Nina, it is imperative you get Diana's Dress from the Revenants. It will
probably take a long time, but your survival against Myria depends on it.

If possible, pick up Mist Armor from the Mist Men for Momo, though personally
I was never given one, even after at least 20 or 30 battles with them while
wearing a Midas Stone. *shrugs* I suppose I just wasn't lucky. My strategies
won't include it.

Also, try to get the Lifestealer from the Vampires for Rei.

The following groups of bosses are primarily comprised of bosses you have
defeated in the past. 

The quickest path to the final save point is left
through door, straight, right through door, straight through door, straight
through door. This involves fighting only 2 battles. 5 Sample 8s and Samples
10, 11, and 12. If you still want to fight all the bosses, far be it from me
to discourage you. However, at least reach the final save point first because
there is a rest point there as well. This way you won't need to waste HP/AP
restoring items after battles. 

Here are all the strategies, but check the original boss
for additional information on them. They are listed in numerical order, not
order of discovery (for easier reference).

XXXIX.Sample 1
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 48 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Protectors, Dragon Helmet, Life Armor,
 Ivory Charm, Titan Belt
-Nothing but 3 Nues. One attack from a Warrior on each should do them in.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 50
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, Silver Tiara, Diana's
 Dress, Ivory Charm, Wisdom Ring
-A pair of Siroccos will vanquish the Nue trio.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 48
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, Silver Tiara, Force Armor,
 Artemis' Cap, Ivory Charm
-Don't even bother powering up. You can already kill these Nues in one blow
 anyway, or, if that's too long for you, you can just Ragnarok them to their
 graves. :)

XXXX.Sample 2
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 48 
-Recommended Formation: Attack 
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Protectors, Dragon Helmet, Life Armor,
 Ivory Charm, Titan Belt
-It's only 2 Hugeslugs. Use Flame Breath as a Flame Whelp, then Restore
 Form, and smash them as a Warrior.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 50
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, Silver Tiara, Diana's
 Dress, Ivory Charm, Wisdom Ring
-heh heh. Your present equipment blocks Syphon. This makes this easy battle
 even easier. Simply Sirocco those 2 Hugeslugs to their dooms.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 48
-Recommended Formation: Normal
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, Silver Tiara, Force Armor,
 Wisdom Ring, Spirit Ring
-Fortunately, Syphon is blocked by this equipment. Anyway, all you'll need
 here is a couple Protects and a Speed for the EX turn. Now, Ragnarok,
 Ragnarok, Ragnarok!

XXXXI.Sample 3
A.Ryu 
-Recommended Level: 48 
-Recommended Formation: Defense 
-Recommended Party: Rei, Momo 
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Protectors, Dragon Helmet, Life Armor,
 Ivory Charm, Titan Belt
-Meet 2 Mikbas. The suped version of the Tiger Hybrid should cut it (plus
 you get the EX turn). Just use Shadowalk after Shadowalk.
D.Nina
-Recommended Level: 50
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Ouroboros, Spiked Gauntlets, Silver Tiara, Diana's
 Dress, Ivory Charm, Wisdom Ring
-This Mikba duo is less fierce than you would think. Lucky Strike does
 considerably less damage than before, and his other attacks inflict
 negligible damage. The EX turn should make this battle pie as you Myollnir
 them. MultiVitamin between if you take too much damage.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 48
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, Silver Tiara, Force Armor,
 Artemis' Cap, Ivory Charm
-You already have an EX turn, so all you need is your quadra-Protects and
 quadra-Mights. Other than Lucky Strike and Reprisal -> Lucky Strike, there's
 nothing to worry about. Generally, you'll be fine if your HP is greater than
 1/2.

XXXXII.Sample 4
-Myria's Orbital Station
-Attacks: Double Blow, Snap, Evil Eye

-I don't think I've seen this boss before... but, anyway, this big, giant 
 bird can be impossible without the status protection from the Protectors,
 and (especially) the Light Bangle. He has an annoying repertoire of attacks
 that can make him a little difficult. The good news: status protection will
 block the paralyzing Evil Eye; the bad news: until he runs out of AP,
 you'll have to battle him normally. Cast Protect frequently to counter his
 Snaps and cast Restore when your HP is in the yellow. Once he's out of AP,
 smash him with the Warrior.

-This big bird sure is durable. 28 Myollnirs were needed to knock him down.
 Anyway, the hard part about this fight is that his strong physical attack
 requires you to stay near maximum health, especially because he
 occasionally acts before you can. Be careful when tangling with this bird.

-Blunt the 3 Stallions each twice. Then, because 3 Barriers were cast on
 Sample 10, the ice elemental Stallion, attack with Blizzard. Remember to
 heal inbetween when you're at one-half HP, and, when Samples 11 and 12
 deviate from the elemental spell casting, start healing at a higher
 minimum. Continue the pattern until either Sample 11 or Sample 12 is
 defeated. Then Iceblast the remaining one (If at any time during this
 process you run out of AP, only use a Black Porgy.). Now, for Sample 10,
 cast a few Weakens on him, switch the Wisdom Ring for a Titan Belt, and
 eliminate him physically.

 watch out for their physicals.

This is it. Make sure you're well stocked and powerful enough to fight the
final boss.

-I've never advised you to use this form as of yet, but never before has it
 so been needed. Quickly transform into the Tiamat. Surprisingly, the Tiamat
 is absolutely perfect for this battle. It has a huge attack, high HP and
 defense, small AP cost, and, best of all, immunity to status attacks (Evil
 Eye and Venom) and Death! Myria will waste countless turns trying to cast
 these three spells on you while you pound away at her! Once your form is 
 broken by either Myria or lack of AP, use a couple Wisdom Fruits, and
 transform into the Tiamat again. Just keep pounding at her and eventually
 ultimate victory will be yours!

-I won't blame you for leveling up to 60. This final battle may seem almost
 impossible at 50. Not only is the goddess faster than you, but also her
 physical attack is lethal, usually knocking off at least one-half your HP.
 Her magic attacks do considerably less damage though (except Holocaust) but
 still add to the bon fire. The best opportunitites for the [approximately]
 100 Myollnirs you will need to win is after Venom, Evil Eye, or Death, as
 they are blocked by Ivory Charm. However, as the battle progresses, Myria
 gives you less opportunities to get in a few hits. To make it even worse,
 she even heals away the damage you inflict thanks to her Restore. Good luck
 and welcome to heck.
E.Momo
-Recommended Level: 49
-Recommended Formation: Defense
-Recommended Equipment: Atomic Bomb, Mind Shield, Silver Tiara, Force Armor,
 Artemis' Cap, Ivory Charm
-This battle took place in 3 phases. I'm going to cut it down phase by phase.
-Phase 1: Myria sticks with Venom, Evil Eye (the latter 2 worthless as they
 are blocked), Blizzard, Inferno, (these 2 are nothing thanks to Ivory Charm)
 Sanctuary, and a deadly physical. Since Sanctuary will cancel out any major
 status building you try, choose one stat-up spell to cast once. The best
 choice is actually Speed. It allows your healing spells to almost always take
 effect before Myria has chance to attack, so you can more economically use
 your turns since you know exactly when to heal. Even if Myria casts
 Sanctuary, if you have 130+ HP, you can cast Speed again, endure a potential
 max damage physical, and Rejuvenate back to max HP. The only drawback of
 this phase is that you only inflict an average 200 damage... whenever you hit. 
-Phase 2: This is the most annoying of the phases. Slowly shifting away from
 status attacks and stat boost nullification, Myria pulls out Holocaust (which
 Ivory Charm does **** for) and the detested Restore (which heals a little
 less than 2 of your successful attacks). You rarely ever get a chance to
 attack as most of your turns are spent healing or recasting Speed, and, of
 course, your accuracy is still ****, so, considering all these factors, it's
 needless to say that progress is slow. 
-Phase 3: At this point, Myria has almost completely shifted towards direct
 offense. Somewhere between Phase 2 and 3 she pulls out Myollnir... >_> <_<
 Every once of a while she pulls out Venom as well, but Evil Eye and Sanctuary
 stop appearing. This is your opportunity to pull out several stacked Protects
 and Mights. Your attacks now inflict 500+ damage... at least every time
 you hit. Not even Death, the final spell she unleashes, is a problem, yet
 again thanks to your Ivory Charm. Now, that you're powered up and prepared
 for anything she can do, finish Myria off.


If you've made it to this point, then you've won! Congratulations! Try
another SCC if you like. Hopefully, it will be more challenging than the
last...

C.!Rei!
  !!!!!

1)Difficulty for character: Easy. Rei's high agility easily grants him EX
turns in almost every situation. An extra turn in a boss fight is a very
useful thing. The Weretiger form can get him through those situations where 
Rei's power just isn't cutting it. However, Rei is easily killed and being 
unintentive during battles is an easy way to see the Game Over screen a lot.

1)"The Weretiger." This is your ultimate attack, your trump card, your
coup de grace. It has a LOT of power and is only rivalled by Ryu's more 
advanced dragon forms. Since this is an SCC and your other party members are
just going to be lying there on the ground, going Berserk doesn't matter at
all. The only flaw now is that you have to get it set up just right before 
transforming, because Soul Gems leave you in Weretiger form.

1)"Lightning Magic? Not really." Rei has it, but it stinks. Jolt and Lightning
are gotten after the point where they would be useful. Myollnir is a great
spell, but Rei's low INT lowers its usefulness and he doesn't have enough AP
to sustain repeated castings.

1)"Speed, Slow and everything else Rei has" If you can't get an EX turn
normally, Rei has the means to tweak the speeds of everyone on the battlefield
so he can get that EX turn. Normally one dose of Speed will get you the EX
turn, though.&nbsp; Death is not useful at all. It misses too much. Pilfer
will get you some good stuff near the end of the game, like the Burglar Garb,
Aries Gloves and Soul Gems. Otherwise not as useful as it is in a
regular game.

1)"EX turns" You will be seeing these a lot. Unfortunately, you will need to 
see these a lot. Aside from Agility, Rei's stats aren't so hot. He isn't
really a heavy hitter, his defense is pretty bad, his INT is poor, he doesn't
have a lot of AP and his HP isn't high either. To sum it up, most of Rei's
stats are below average, but his agility and ability to get constant EX turns
actually counters this and makes Rei a very strong character.

1)Summary of Pros and Cons

Pros
Great Agility
Decent Power
Has the means to get EX turns in any situation
Decent Spells
WERETIGER

Cons
Below average stats
No healing spells
Weretiger is berserk

G.!Garr!
  !!!!!!

1)Difficulty for character- Moderate:  Garr doesn't deserve all of the bashing
he gets. Sure he is slow, has little AP and his Intelligence is garbage, but
he can more than make up for that. Though his deficiencies are compensated for
to an extent by his other, more favorable statistics, his lack of speed can
really hurt later on.

1)"Garr has been fighting for almost 500 years, so he has picked up a couple 
tricks." Garr is the king of fighting.  His combo of very high HP, Power 
and Defense make him an insane powerhouse.  I haven't seen a level yet where 
Garr didn't gain at least 3 Power or 1 Defense.  Normally the increases are 
5 and 4, respectively.

1)"Garr needs to stop eating those Wyndian Gourmet Donuts."  Honestly he is 
pratically inhaling those things when you are getting the passport as a 
child.  Back to the point, Garr is slow.  He has heavy equipment and doesn't 
gain a lot of Agility.  So you can do one of two things about this.  You can 
try and raise his agility as much as possible by using his lighter, weaker 
equipment and equipping accessories that raise Agility.  Or you can use his 
slowness to your advantage.  Equip the biggest, baddest equipment you can 
find and use Defense Formation almost all of the time.  You are going to go 
last anyway, so get some extra defense in the process.  For healing in 
battles, you have to think an attack ahead and heal when two more attacks 
will kill you instead of one.  If you wait for the one, the enemy is going 
to kill you with the one before you can heal.

1)"Ha!  Your flames are of no avail here!" Garr has a natural 50% Fire 
Resistance on at all times.  This can stack with other fire resistance 
bonuses to create better bonuses.  Get a Flame inoculation.  Now you have 
100% fire immunity and you haven't equipped a single piece of fire resistant 
equipment!  With proper equipment management, you can make that Ring of Fire 
obselete and free up an accessory slot.  The only thing to watch for when 
stacking effects is that a Resist+Resist+Resist does not equal Absorb.

1)"Why does Garr even have Magic?"  Seriously, Flare, Fireblast and Inferno 
would be so much more useful on Momo or Nina.  All they can do for Garr is 
trigger enemy effects, like waking up Vulcans, destroying the Huge Slug's 
barrier, etc etc.  Pyrokinesis is a lot better because it takes Garr's power 
into account and can actually be used due to Garr's low AP.  Kyrie is fun 
because everyone likes high % insta-kill undead moves!  As for Gambit, why
spend 2 or 3 turns trying to get a critical when you can deal that damage 
through regular attacks in the same period of time with the chance of 
getting a critical hit?

1)Summary of Pros and Cons

Pros:
Huge HP, Power, and Defense
Can use Garr's slowness to your advantage
Powerful Equipment
High Reprisal rate
Frequent critical hits
Kyrie
Only character with "pure" fire magic
Innate 50% Fire resistance

Cons:
SLOW
Next to no AP
His intelligence is garbage
Heavy equipment
No healing spells
No stat up/stat down spells

I.Nue
C.Rei
 1-Recommended Level: 8
  -Recommended Formation: Attack
  -Recommended Equipment: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helmet, Leather 
   Armor, Talisman
  -Just attack her until she runs

II.Nue
C.Rei
 1-Attack Formation
  -Recommended level: 8
  -Recommended Equips: Silver Knife, Bracers, Bandana, Leather Armour,
   Talisman
  -The Nue isn't hard at all.  Equip the Bracers and Bandana instead of the 
   better armour, in order to guarantee yourself first action in a turn.  She
   reprisals often, so don't let your HP get below 20.  Don't bother Pilfering
   his Power Food, you can't use it this SCC.

III.Pooch
C.Rei
 1-Attack Formation
  -Recommended Level: 9
  -Recommended Equips: Bronze Sword, Cloth Shield, Brass Helm, Leather Armour, 
   Talisman
  -This isn't difficult.  You will be faster than him, but not fast enough for
   an EX turn. Attack when you can and heal when you get under 30 HP.  Just
   watch out if he lowers your defense a lot with Snap.

IV.Rocky
C.Rei
 1-Attack Formation
  -Recommended Level: 9
  -Recommended Equips: Bronze Sword, Cloth Shield, Brass Helm, Leather Armour, 
   Talisman
  -This is pretty much the same as the Pooch.  The only differences are that
   Ryu must learn Jump to survive the next dungeon and Rocky's Jump can
   seriously damage you, so be ready to heal at a moment's notice.

IX.Amalgam
C.Rei
 1-Attack Formation
  -My Level: 9, I recommend a higher level
  -Recommended Equips: Silver Knife, Cloth Shield, Brass Helm, Leather Armour, 
   Talisman
  -This strategy is written for a Level 9 Rei equipped with a Bronze Sword 
   instead of the Silver Knife.  If you have a Silver Knife, the battle will
   be easier.
  -This battle was difficult.  You can't get an EX turn, but you are faster 
   than him.  He deals about 20 damage per hit and you only have about 60 HP
   at this point.  Alternate between attacking and healing with healing herbs.
   The battle should go fairly smoothly until Amalgam starts using Astral
   Shift.  Astral Shift did about 40 damage.  This causes big problems.  He
   will start using Astral Shift almost every turn.  The only good point is
   that he will die in 1 or 2 hits now.  The best solution I can offer is to 
   take a risk, attack and hope he doesn't kill you that turn.  You can kill
   him the next turn.  This isn't a reliable strategy, but it was best
   possible under these conditions.

X.Balio and Sunder
C.Rei
 1-Say goodbye to Rei and Teepo as your party gets slaughtered by Balio and
   Sunder, and prepare for the longest stall point known to mankind.

XX.Stallion
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -The only Level: 13
  -Recommended Equips: Spear, Buckler, Knight Helm, Scale Mail, Titan Belt, 
   Artemis' Cap
  -This guy isn't too hard if you are careful.  Before you even go to the
   Maekyss, make sure you have a Buckler, a Knight Helm and the Artemis' Cap
   in your inventory.  Stallion can deal about 25 damage in one turn with his
   chop or Utmost Attack.  Since Garr is slow, you have to adopt a policy of
   "Can I survive 2 hits?" instead of "Can I survive 1 hit?".  With this in
   mind, use a Vitamin whenever you get to 40 or 50 HP.  Whenever you aren't
   healing, use your regular attack.  Garr's magic is completely worthless in
   this battle, so stay away from it.

XXI.Zig
G.Garr
 1-I trained Beyd up enough so that you won't need to interfere.

XXII.Gazer
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 15
  -Recommended Equips: Long Spear, Mithril Shield, Knight Helm, Scale Mail, 
   Titan Belt, Light Bangle
  -This guy is very easy.  He has a weakness to Fire and fire is what Garr
   has.  Garr doesn't have a lot of AP, so stick with Pyrokinesis until you
   run out of AP. Afterwards, use your regular attack.  Gazer's best attack in
   Eye Beam, dealing 40 damage.  I don't think he ever will use it twice in a
   row, so heal when your HP hits 50.  He won't give you too many problems.

XXIV.Gisshan, Charyb, Scylla
G.Garr
 1-Attack Formation
  -Recommended Level: 23
  -Recommended Equips: Long Spear, Mithril Shield, Knight Helm, Magma Armour, 
   Titan Belt, Light Bangle
  -Before the battle even begins, there is some important preparation to be
   done.  First off, get to level 23.  Wake up Vulcans in Mt. Zublo with Flare
   (not Pyrokinesis) for lots of easy experience.  Second is to get a suit of
   Magma Armour.  Woken-up Vulcans drop these.  It isn't a very super rare
   drop (I had 2 by level 22), but if you are worried, fight only Vulcans on
   the way to level 23.  Lastly, once you are level 23 and have your shiny
   suit of Magma Armour, leave Mt. Zublo, rest if you want, then go to Rhapala
   and get the Changeblock inoculation.  This plus the Light Bangle makes you
   immune to status effects and Gisshan likes to cast two of the nastier ones.
  -After fighting in this battle, you will see why bad the bosses' with no
   support lose so badly.  Charyb and Scylla are both powerful attackers and
   Gisshan is an excellent support mage with his status effects and healing,
   while Garr is like the average boss, an attacker with little forms of
   healing.  Charyb and Scylla pound you relentlessly with a powerful regular
   attack, Wall of Fire and the dreaded Snap.  If you get Snap'd successfully
   (defense lowered) twice while both fire worms are around, you can basically
   reset the game at that point because you are not going to win without a
   miracle.  Garr can't be taking 120 damage per turn and still kill a worm
   with Gisshan casting Vitalize like the rabid old man he is. Gisshan likes
   to cast Sleep and Confuse a lot.  If you inoculate yourself with
   Changeblock and don't rest after you do (you can still go into camp and
   save, just don't rest), then you don't have to worry about Gisshan at all.
   Be very happy when the worms use Wall of Fire. Garr's natural 50% Fire
   Resistance plus the Magma Armour's Fire immunity makes you absorb Fire and
   this frees up an accessory slot.
  -Kill Charyb first.  Scylla likes to cast Wall of Fire more, which is good,
   and Charyb likes to use Snap, which is bad.  Kill Charyb as fast as
   possible and hope he doesn't use Snap often.  There is a certain element of
   luck involved with this.  Do not stop to heal or you will get behind.
   Charyb must die as fast as possible.  Use a Soul Gem if you have to, but do
   not stop.  Garr's high Reprisal rate and semi frequent criticals come in
   handy here. When Charyb is dead, breath a sigh of relief, because the
   battle is all downhill from here. Heal when you get to 80 HP because
   Scylla can do 70 damage after a couple Snaps.  Gisshan will probably start
   casting Vitalize every turn now, but he can't keep up to your 120 damage
   attack.  By the time Scylla is dead, Gisshan will probably be out of AP.  
   Dispatch him with ease and be happy that you overcame this difficult 
   battle.

XXVI.Dragon Zombie
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended level: 23 or 26 (depending on what method you use)
  -Recommended Equips: Gigantess, Mithril Shield, Mithril Helm, Magma Armour, 
   Titan Belt, Light Bangle
  -This boss is very easy.  All he does is try to inflict Poison or Confuse on
   you, or he attacks you for 30 damage.  There are two ways of beating this
   boss.  One is to just beat him up in true Garr style.  Heal when you get to
   50 HP and you won't have a problem.  The other way is to level up to level
   26 and use Kyrie on the boss for a one-hit kill (the boss is undead).  Both
   of these methods are very easy to execute and this easy boss fight is quite
   welcome after that evil that is Gisshan and his fire worms.

XXVII.Weretiger
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 24
  -Recommended Equips: Gigantess, Steel Gauntlets, Mithril Helm, Magma Armour, 
   Titan Belt, Light Bangle
  -Just attack the entire time, the Weretiger doesn't have a lot of 
   HP nor does he do a lot of damage.  Heal when you get 60 HP and the 
   Weretiger will flee in terror.

XXVIII.Mikba
C.Rei
 1-Normal Formation
  -The Only Level: 21
  -Recommended Equips: Katzbalger, Steel Gauntlets, Mithril Helm, Lgt.
   Clothing, Titan Belt, Soul Gem
  -This battle is not hard.  Because Rei starts off the battle dead and has a
   script programmed in, the battle must be treated a little differently than
   the rest of the SCC. The script I am speaking of is the automatic Weretiger
   transformation when Rei stops "slumping" (his HP gets out of the critical
   area).  Start off the battle by reviving Rei (using Ryu) with an Ammonia.
   Get the other party member killed somehow.  Do not heal Rei. On Rei's turn,
   change his equipment to the recommended equipment above (you can substitute
   the Katzbalger for the FeatherSword if you aren't very good at fishing).  
   This gives Rei an EX turn.  Heal Rei to full HP on the turn that you change
   his equipment on.  Rei will transform to the Weretiger on the EX turn.
   Kill Ryu, sit back and watch.  If you are lucky, Rei will kill Mikba before
   dying.  If you aren't lucky, Mikba will kill Rei and the Soul Gem will
   revive him.  The script does not execute again, so you have full control
   over Rei now. Attack Mikba normally and heal when you need to.  He should
   be almost dead from the Weretiger attacks, so it shouldn't take long.
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 25
  -Recommended Equips: Gigantess, SteelGauntlets, Mithril Helm, Magma Armour, 
   Titan Belt, Light Bangle
  -Mikba isn't very difficult if you are careful.  His strength lies in his
   high Reprisal and Lucky Strike rates.  One of his Lucky strikes will do
   about 40 damage so he can do 80 damage in one turn if he is lucky.  If he
   doesn't get a Lucky Strike, then his attack does a measly 12 damage.  The
   only attack you have to slightly worry about aside from Lucky Strike is
   Quake, dealing about 36 damage.  Now that you have an idea of how much
   damage he will deal.  Deciding when to heal is the trickiest part about
   this battle.  If you get between 50-70 HP, heal.  90-120 HP is the danger
   zone.  In this situation, your HP is high enough that you think you can
   attack, but if he gets Lucky Strike twice then you are in a bad situation
   that may require the use of a Soul Gem, (Re-equip the Titan Belt when your
   HP is safe again.) if you didn't use Nina's in the fight with Gisshan or if
   you got the one in Angel Tower.  That's the tricky part of the battle.
   Don't bother with Garr's magic or skills in this fight.  His Fire magic, as
   always, is completely useless and the misses in Gambit trigger Reprisals,
   killing any use that skill has.  Just attack and watch your HP and you will
   come out victorious.

  -This boss caught me by surprise.  Cast Speed on yourself the first turn to
   get the EX turn.  Use a Molotov (this is the only time I will say to use an
   attack item) to get rid of the protective coating.  This boss hits hard
   with its regular attack and doesn't give you very many breaks.  Use your
   regular attack and heal with vitamins when you get below 50 HP. The
   Weretiger is not recommended in this fight.  The slug doesn't have an
   attack you can absorb and equipping Soul Gems is unnecessary.  Remember to
   bring at least 20 vitamins into this fight.

  -The Huge Slug is another boss with a weakness to fire and Garr has more
   fire than he knows what to do with.  The strategy in this battle revolves
   around whether a Flyman dropped the Flame Spear or not.  If one did, equip
   the Flame Spear and attack the Huge Slug, healing when you pass 80 HP.  The
   fire attribute on the Spear will destroy the barrier and the Slug. If you
   didn't get the Flame Spear, don't fret and spend hours and hours looking
   for it. Start the battle by casting Flare on the Huge Slug to destroy the
   barrier. Each turn after that, use Pyrokinesis and heal when you get to 80
   HP.  If he knocks you to 40-45 HP, equip a Soul Gem if you still have one
   and heal.  Re-equip the Titan Belt when your HP is safe again.  If you
   don't have a Soul Gem, then maybe you would be better off healing at 90 HP.

XXX.Shroom
C.Rei

  -Recommended Level: 25
  -Recommended Equips: Katzbalger, Steel Gauntlets, Mithril Helm, Silver Mail, 
   Titan Belt, Ring of Fire
  -This boss was also a surprise, but in a good way.  He wasn't hard at all.
   Start off the battle by casting Speed on yourself.  If you don't get the EX
   turn, cast Slow on him until it connects.  The EX turn is necessary.
   Shroom's attacks aren't very hard to handle. He doesn't hit as hard as the
   Huge Slug with his regular attack.  Lavaburst will heal you. Be happy when
   he uses this.  Ragnarok does about 15 damage.  Head Cracker is his best
   attack and can do up to 90-100 damage.  Stay over 100 HP and attack when
   you have an opening. Continue this pattern until Shroom casts Restore.
   This is your cue to heal up to full HP and use the Weretiger on the EX turn
   (yes, this makes a difference).  He will also introduce Biltz as an attack.
   Fortunately Blitz doesn't have the best hit rate and Rei dodges frequently.
   Shroom will die in 3-4 hits.

  -Recommended Equips: Gigantess, SteelGauntlets, Mithril Helm, Magma Armour,

  -Shroom is easy.  His best attack is HeadCracker, dealing about 60-75
   damage.  With this in mind, heal at 80 HP.  If the Vitamin only heals you
   to 110 HP, use another Vitamin. Lavaburst will heal you and Ragnarok should
   do 0 damage.  Just keep attacking Shroom, Garr's skills aren't useful here.
   When Shroom starts casting Restore, don't get discouraged. Restore will
   heal for more than you are dealing, but keep attacking.  He won't keep
   casting Restore and another 400-500 damage should get him using Blitz.
   Treat Blitz the same as HeadCracker and Shroom should go down in 2 or 3
   attacks.

  -Recommended Equips: Katzbalger, Steel Gauntlets, Mithril Helm, Lgt. 
   Clothing, Titan Belt, Thunder Ring
  -This boss is a joke.  With the recommended equipment, you will
   automatically get an EX turn.  The Angler can only hurt you with his
   regular attack.  Thunder Clap heals you and he has a poison attack.  Equip
   a Light Bangle instead of the Titan Belt, if you don't feel like curing
   poison.  Heal when you are at 80 HP because his regular attack can do 70
   damage. Count how much damage you deal.  When you deal 2000 damage, make
   sure you are at full HP and use the Weretiger on the EX turn to speed the
   boss' demise.
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 29
  -Recommended Equips: Beast Spear, Steel Gauntlets, Mithril Helm, Magma 
   Armour, Thunder Ring, Light Bangle
  -This guy is pathetic.  His only decent attack is Thunder Clap and that will
   heal you. He casts Thunder Clap a lot and it heals for about 100 damage.
   He tries to Poison and Confuse you often in this fight.  If Poison gets
   through the Light Bangle, heal it immediately.  Poison+Beast Spear drain is
   quite deadly if left untreated.  It doesn't matter if Confusion gets
   through because you are just going to be attacking anyway. Keep attacking
   and heal when your HP hits 50.

XXXIII.2 Ammonites
C.Rei
 1-Normal Formation
  -Recommended Level: 31
  -Recommended Equips: Heavy Dagger, Protectors, Platinum Helm, Amber BPlate, 
   Titan Belt, Ring of Ice
  -This is the hardest boss battle since we got Rei back.  The Ammonites hit
   hard with several good attacks and to top it off, there are two of them!
   Start the battle by casting Speed to get the EX turn.  In a lot of battles,
   the EX turn is a novelty.  Here it is very necessary.  Don't hestiate at
   using both turns (normal and EX) in a row to heal.  While there are still
   two of them, they can easily deal 120-140 damage in one turn.
   Theoretically they can deal 180 damage in one turn with both of them using
   a 3-hit Multistrike. Fortunately Rei seems to be able to dodge at least one
   attack in each Multistrike. Be thankful when they use either Tsunami or
   Confuse.  Both have a low chance of hitting, but both hurt when they do.
   Confuse hurts by making you lose your EX turn.  If you don't get your EX
   turn, you are as good as dead.
  -So what do you have going for you in this fight?  They are weak to
   Lightning and there are two of them.  Finally a situation where Rei's
   lightning spells are more useful than his regular attack!  Use Lightning
   until you are out of AP.  If you have any Wisdom fruits or a lot of other
   AP healing items, restore Rei's AP and repeat this process.  If you don't
   have these (like me) or when you run out, you got a tougher fight ahead of
   you.  All you can use is your regular attack.  Keep at one of them until it
   dies.
  -When you get rid of 1, the fight is as good as won.  When one of them dies,
   the other starts using Blizzard, which will heal you because of the Ring of
   Ice.  Use Weretiger now on the next EX turn.  It may not seem like a
   difference but you get more hits on him for his hits on you.  (For example,
   You transform on the EX turn, you attack, then he attacks. You attack 2
   more times before he attacks.  If you transform on the normal turn, he
   attacks then you attack twice, then he attacks.  Instead of going 2 for 2 
   transforming on the normal turn, you go 3 for 2 transforming on the EX
   turn.  One hit in Weretiger form means something).  After you transform, he
   should die in 4-5 hits.
   NOTE: I did not make it to the middle of the deck.  I am horrible at that 
   minigame.
G.Garr

  -Recommended Level: 30
  -Recommended Equips: Beast Spear, Ice Shield, Platinum Helm, Blizzard Mail,

  -Yes, that says 2 Light Bangles.  These guys like to use Confuse and you
   cannot afford to be confused at any point in the battle.  2 Light
   Bangles=100% status protection.  With this setup, the only attack they have
   that can deal more than 50 damage is Tsunami and that seems to have a low
   hit rate (it never connected against me at all and they used it a lot)..
   That aside, these guys aren't too hard. Keep your HP above 110-120.
   Try and use Multivitamins if you have them, but using 2 turns in a row to
   heal using Vitamin(s) works as well.  Keep attacking with the Beast Spear,
   de-equipping it every turn that you heal.  There's no sense in losing 10 HP 
   for nothing. When one dies, the other will start using higher-level Ice
   Magic, but your equipment makes you immune to that.  Don't get careless
   just because there is only one now and heal when you hit 80 HP.  The last
   Ammonite should go down quickly.

XXXIV.Elder
C.Rei
 1-Normal Formation
  -Recommended level: 35
  -Recommended Equips: Piercing Edge, Spiked Gauntlets, Platinum Helm, 
   AmberBPlate, Ring of Fire, Thunder Ring
  -There are two ways of going about this fight.  Method 1 is easy to do and
   works most of the time.  Method 2 takes a lot of healing supplies, time and
   patience.  Use Method 1 and save yourself a lot of time.
   -Method 1: The Fast, Risky Way: Start the battle by casting Speed on
    yourself to get an EX turn, heal any damage you receive that turn, then
    Weretiger the next EX turn.  That's it.  Sit back and relax, Jono
    should die in about 12-13 hits (less if you get some criticals).  Turn
    down the volume on the game and listen to Eye of the Tiger while watching
    the Weretiger completely destroy Jono.  The risky part about this method
    is that it depends on him using Bad Back, Inferno, or Myollnir every now
    and then or him missing his physical attacks.  If you are a fan of
    probability, this method works 40% of the time (as in I tried it 10 times
    and it worked 4 of them.  They all occured within 7 trials though.)
    Still, for the true power of the Brood, it went down way too easily to the
    Tiger.
   -Method 2: The Slow, Drawn-Out, Safe way: Start the battle by casting Speed
    on yourself to get an EX turn.  Heal whenever you drop below 120 HP and
    just attack whenever you can.  This method will take you a long time and
    there isn't really any reason to use this method when you can use the
    above method much faster.  Unless you have an allergic reaction to Game
    Over screens or a phobia of them. Seriously, go with Method 1, it will
    take you about 60-70 attacks to kill him this way. You could be halfway
    through next dungeon by now if you use Method 1.

  -Recommended Equips: Beast Spear, Laquer Shield, Laquer Helm, Magma Armour,

  -Mighty dragon indeed.  Garr is more than a match for this guy.  With the
   above setup, you will heal from all of Jono's spells, except for Sirocco,
   which you will take 0 damage from.  Start swinging that Beast Spear from
   the moment the battle starts.  Keep your HP above 100 to guard against
   Double Blow.  If it falls down to 70, de-equip the Beast Spear, equip the
   Life Armour to get that extra bit of defense that you might need, and use a
   Multivitamin.  Fix your equipment the next turn and return to beating up 
   Jono.

XXXV.Manmo
C.Rei
 1-Normal Formation
  -Recommended Level: 39 (38 is the bare minimum)
  -Recommended Equips: Piercing Edge, Spiked Gauntlets, Platinum Helm, Life 
   Armour, Light Bangle, High Boots
  -This guy could be considered the Anti-Rei.  A powerful physical attack 
   coupled with a very high Reprisal rate are this boss' trump card.  Rei
   doesn't have a very good defense and his HP is kinda low.  The damage seems
   to be very random, ranging from 20-100.  He can (and sometimes does) do 200
   damage in one turn.  This will kill you at full health and not even an EX
   turn can save you from that.  So all we have to do is use magic right? Well
   Rei's magic isn't the best.  In fact, it is pretty poor, until Level 38.
   Why you ask? Myollnir! This why you have to be level 38 before this fight.
   Myollnir will save you this fight. Cast Speed on yourself for the EX turn
   on the first turn and start casting Myollnir every turn.  Heal your HP when
   it hits 110 and keep restoring your AP.  It should take around 19 Myollnirs
   to kill the boss.  Don't even think about using the Weretiger for this
   fight.  No one is lucky enough to dodge that many physical attacks and this
   boss doesn't have an absorbable attack.

  -Recommended Equips: Beast Spear, Laquer Shield, Laquer Helm, Life Armour,

  -Manmo is a joke.  Sure this guy has Power and a high Reprisal rate, 
   but Garr has more Power, a high Reprisal rate, a good Critical Rate and
   excellent Defense.  Manmo's regular attack at its best will do 60 damage,
   normally 30-40.  De-equip the Beast Spear and use a Multivitamin when you
   hit 100 HP, re-equipping the Beast Spear the next turn.  The Beast Spear
   rips Manmo up, so stick with your regular attack.  Garr's abilities are,
   as usual, useless.

XXXVI.Chimera
C.Rei
 1-Normal Formation, 3rd Slot
  -Recommended Level: 44
  -Recommended Equips: Slicer, Aries Gloves, Sun Mask, Burglar Garb, Soul Gem, 
   Soul Gem
  -This is hands down the hardest fight in the game because of Paralyzer.
   Paralyzer is like a 75% Death attack that cannot be blocked by items.
   I recommended that you use the special guidelines for this fight contained
   the SCC faq.
   However there is a way to win while still staying inside the SCC rules.  Go 
   into the battle with the Ring of Fire and Ring of Ice equipped.  Cast Speed
   on yourself first thing to get the EX turn.  If he attacks you (he will
   probably hit one of your other party members), heal on the EX turn, defend
   the next turn.  On the EX turn if you are full health, equip 2 Soul Gems
   (if you don't have 2 Soul Gems, go Pilfer some from the Wraiths on the path
   to Eden (they appear in the room with the escalators), then use Weretiger.
   If he doesn't attack you, equip 2 Soul Gems, then use Weretiger.
   Now you need luck.  If the Chimera uses Paralyzer you will probably get hit
   with it and get Game Over.  The Weretiger should be averaging around 500
   damage per hit and criticalling for 1000 damage.  Before and during the
   battle, do whatever you need to get luck.  Get all of your good luck charms 
   together, put on your lucky underwear, do whatever you need to.  Well if
   all goes well, then you will emerge victorious.
   Don't use the above method unless you: a) enjoy torturing yourself, b) have 
   a lot of time on your hands or c) absolutely refuse to do this fight
   outside of the normal rules.

   Charm, Titan Belt
  -EXCEPTION:  Use the exception, Garr can't do it.  Even using the exception,
  this isn't an easy fight.  The above set up lets Garr cause 400 damage/turn
  and be resistant to magic, but the Chimera is causing about 130 damage with
  his regular attack.  With this in mind, heal when you pass 180 HP, and if
  you are knocked down past 130, equip a Soul Gem for that turn and heal.
  Keep attacking and with a little luck, the Chimera will go down.

XXXVIII.Dragon Lord
C.Rei
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 45
  -Recommended Equips: Slicer, Aries Gloves, Sun Mask, Burglar Garb, Balance 
   Ring, Titan Belt/Ring of Fire
  -He isn't nearly as bad as the Chimera, but he is going to take around 40
   minutes so make sure you have some time before fighting him.  Cast Speed on
   yourself to get the EX turn.  In most battles, the EX turn is used to cause
   some extra damage or to heal, basically support the main turn.  In this
   battle the EX turn is your main turn.  You must defend every main turn in
   order to survive Teepo's attacks, namely Triple Blow.  Every turn you
   attack, equip the Titan Belt.  Whenever you aren't attacking, or on every
   main turn, equip the Ring of Fire.  Keep your HP above 155 at all times.
   Triple Blow, in Defense formation defending, can do around 140-150 damage.
   Keep up this tedious pattern (have a LOT of Vitamins and MultiVitamins) for
   the entire battle.  After approximately 30 minutes, Teepo will run out of
   AP.  His only attacks now are his regular attack (100-120 damage) and 
   Howling.  Equip the Titan Belt now and attack every turn now, still healing
   and keeping your hp above 130.  If you are suicidal and impatient and don't
   mind doing the battle over again, equip a Soul Gem or two and use Weretiger
   to speed up the battle.  I do not recommend that course of action.
   Good Job on beating Teepo!  There's only one left!

  -Recommended Equips: Dragon Spear, Giant Shield, Sun Mask, Life Armour,
   Light Bangle, Titan Belt (If you want to use the Ivory Charm, go ahead and
   replace the Light Bangle.  I didn't want to, so I stuck with my Light
   Bangle)
  -Garr is back at his forte: dragon-slaying!  And this time he has a nice new
   dragon slaying spear*!  Teepo can deal some serious damage, but it isn't
   anything Garr can't handle.  Teepo's regular attack does about 100 damage
   and is used a lot.  Triple Blow does anywhere from 40-60 damage per hit.
   Commonly, it will deal 140 damage.  Heal when your HP drops below 200 to be
   safe.  If it drops to 175, you can most likely heal without dying.  If it
   gets to 130 or below that, equip a Soul Gem instead of the Titan Belt for
   that turn and hope he uses Howling or Inferno.  The plan of the attack is
   the same as always.  Poke it with your Spear until it is dead.
  -For some fun, go into the battle in Attack Formation with the Dragon Spear 
   equipped and watch the damages.  Don't expect to win through.

acquire a Divine Helmet for Garr. If you can get one, good for you, but don't
obsess over it.

   as well.  Resist+Immune=Absorb. Inoculations count as a 50% Resist item.
   Keep this in mind for the rest of the game.
   Back to the boss, the point of that explanation was blocking Evil Eye,
   which inflicts the hated Paralyze status effect.  Paralyze means Game Over.
   The boss also has a very heavy physical attack, so keep your HP above 200.

   has a large arsenal of powerful attacks. The worst to best are: Death,
   Myollnir, regular attack, Holocaust, Blizzard, Sirocco, Inferno.
   Fortunately she rarely uses Death and if she does, either Guts or the Soul
   Gem will save you.  Myollnir is cast often and does about 200-225 damage.
   Rei only has 235 HP at level 50 so you need to be at full HP at all times.
   The regular attack is about 175 damage, but it never criticaled nor
   reprisaled, so don't worry about that happening.  The rest of the attacks
   are nothing special and are easily healed from.  Don't use your lightning
   spells, your regular attack is better.  Keep attacking and healing with
   Multivitamins.  Bring at least 60 into battle.  Sadly, for all of its 
   greatness, Weretiger has no use here.  You need to heal almost every turn
   unless Myria uses Evil Eye or Venom. This fight won't be as long as the
   Teepo fight or as random as the Chimera fight.  Sit back, stay on your toes
   and Congratulations on beating this SCC!
G.Garr
 1-Defense Formation
  -Recommended Level: 44+
  -Recommended Equips: Dragon Spear, Giant Shield, Sun Mask, Life Armour,
   Ivory Charm,  Titan Belt, later a Soul Gem
  -Get a Changeblock Inoculation before the fight.  This fight takes an 
   hour.  It isn't fun.  With Defense Formation and an Ivory Charm, Myria
   isn't going to be dealing more than 100 damage per turn in the beginning.
   Since Garr's skills were, are, and will always be, completely wasted on
   him, we are stuck in an incredibly tedious pattern of Attack, Attack, Heal,
   or sometimes Attack, Heal, Attack.  Bring a book to read, all you have to
   do to win is glance up at the screen and check your HP every turn.  If it
   is over 200, attack.  If it is under 200, use a Multivitamin.  The Ivory
   Charm + Changeblock protects you from everything, EXCEPT DEATH.  You can
   still get toasted by Death, but the ultra-safe method of healing when you
   get to 200 HP means that you still have your 2 Soul Gems for the fight.  
   When you see Myria use Holocaust for the first time, switch the Titan Belt
   for a Soul Gem.  After an hour, Myria will finally be crushed.

E. Peco

2)Difficulty: Easy-Average
 
2)"The Best Offense is a Good Defense" Peco has an extremly high natural 
defense. Putting him in attack formation will only lower his defense slightly
(like to aroud Ryu's), so always keep Peco in attack formation, unless defense
is better for a certain battle (I.E., you're in an area with a lot of heavy
hitters).
 
2)"An Eye for an Eye" Peco's counterattack rate is very high as well and his 
critical attack rate. Use this to your advantage when following the previous 
tip. This alone makes him a formidable opponent.
 
2)"This is What Happens to Smokers!" OK, that was really lame, but Peco's only 
real elemental offense is his breath attacks, which will do big damage to 
elemental enemys later. His sleep breath spell is also useful for stopping
several enemies whikle you take them down. Venom breath isn't that useful.
It doesn't take off enough HP to be really worth it to me.
 
2)"Healing? Ha! Who needs it?" Peco seriously does not need to heal much, 
except maybe from Myria's Holocaust spell or other high-level magic. But just
in case, he naturally learns Rejuvenate to get him out of a pinch, as well as 
Purify. He regenerates ~5% of his max HP each round, and his high HP and
defense makes him a character who can stay in there for a long time
 
2)"Slow and Steady Looses the Battle" Simply put, Peco's slower than a rock. 
You need to plan accordingly your battle strategy. You won't have support 
magic, so that meens no speed or slow spell. He will almost always go last.
This can be both a good and bad thing. You need to predict what the enemy
will do, and attack/heal accordingly. 
 
2)"Is Peco Related to Fighter?" 8-bit-Theate reference folks. Peco's
intelligence leaves much to be desired, and you can't use item magic anyway
due to the SCC rules. This shouldn't be too big of a problem, as his breath
attacks depend on HP, so this shouldn't hurt you too much. 
 
2)Summary of Pros and Cons
  + High defense (Able to stay alive for a while)
  + Auto HP regeneration (Longer longevitety)
  + Access to useful spells (Breath attacks + Rejuvenate)
  + Above average attack (Finish fights quickly)
  + High counter rate (More damage overall)
  - Slow (Need to plan ahead for healing)
  - Low intelligence (Not too bad, but a couple of his spells are weakened
    due to this)

                         Section #7- "Secondary" SCCs
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, I call these "secondary" because essentially these are SCCs of the other
characters with additional conditions. As there are a near limitless number of
these, I won't be doing these. However, anyone else who has an idea for one and
would like to do one, feel free. In fact, send me the information about it in
case someone else should like to do it.

Feel like playing through as Ryu without Accession or with only mandatory
genes? Go ahead. Feel like playing through using one specific dragon form
for every battle? Try it. Want to play as Momo without any stat boosters? Give
it a shot. Whatever you can think of, whatever you'd like to do. Try it and
send it to me. This is where it'll go.

Check the FAQ section for any questions that are unanswered here.

and regained immediately afterwards.

                          Section #9- Faerie Village
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The faerie village is another saving grace in the SCCs.

Of course, your first priority should be the development of the village, but
these are your next important priorities.

A Distant Expedition post with 3 Faeries: the sacred and mighty Ivory Charm.
This is the easiest method to get your hands on it. It is imperative that
you get an Ivory Charm as soon as possible. Other items of note include Momo's
Ghostbuster and Wisdom Fruits.

Next, establish 3 merchants' shops each with 3 faeries. Set up a "Speed"
Item Shop, an "Ability" Handyman Shop", and an "Ability" Weapon Shop. Through
these shops, you gain access to Nina's Ouroboros, an endless supply of Soul
Gems, AmberB Plate, an early supply of MultiVitamins, etc.

Here is where you make your own decision. You can choose between a couple
full Gift Shops and a full Copy Shop, or 3 full Gift Shops (or maybe just
switch between them). Why? For more Wisdom Fruits, at least for the characters
who need Wisdom fruits anyway... The Gift Shop is more dependable but slower
than the Copy Shop. Believe it or not, the Spirit Ring won't be a reason for
establishing the Gift Shop. Many of you may prefer the Copy Shop though as
you can [obviously] accumulate needed items other than Wisdom Fruits.

                        Section #10- The Lavaman Trick
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, I've done some work on this and discovered that it's not really worth
the trouble. Let's take the example of Ryu:

Ryu
-Lv.48
-Defense Formation
-Equipment: Royal Sword, Dragon Shield, Dragon Helmet, Life Armor, Ivory
 Charm, Soul Gem
-I started off by transforming into a Behemoth with Miracle+Flame+Thorn.
 I then successfully attacked the Lavaman with Flame Claw 8 times before I
 ran out of AP and reverted form. At this point, the Lavaman would randomly
 switch between casting Inferno and attacking (the latter would kill me in 1
 hit). I then used Bonebreak to defeat him and received approximately 4000
 experience from him.

Note that after 8 flame elemental attacks on the Lavaman, he could kill
Ryu in one hit. I doubt the other characters would fare as well against him.
The Behemoth took at least 200 damage per attack from the Lavaman. The other
characters would need to be extraordinarily lucky to survive long enough to
get the potential 65535 experience out of him (remember that you're limited
to 2 Soul Gems).

In addition to this, the level of strength that would even be recquired to
survive would probably be above the level limit anyway. I've concluded that
it's really not worth the trouble involved to get the 65535 experience, at
least for most of the characters. I'll consider looking into a little more,
but I think this will be my final judgment on the matter.

==============================================================================

                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Section #11- Archmage & Berserker
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know what you're thinking: "WTF are you talking about, Rag? Archmage &
Berserker in an SCC?! You've got to be kidding?! They'd pound me into the
ground!" Well... maybe they will, maybe they won't. I'm not sure if all
12 scenarios are possible, but I know with 100% certainty that some of them
are. Keep in mind that, if a scenario is possible for a certain character and
you're playing the SCC for that character, then to get true 100% completion
of the SCC you are obligated to fight that battle.
 
I'll share with you the information I've already gathered, but don't become
impatient with me. This is by no measure an easy task. Here we go:

--------
Archmage: 3000 HP; Attacks: Blizzard, Myollnir, Mind Sword
--------

A.Ryu
-Recommended Level: 49
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Party: Rei, (irrelevant)
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Dragon Shield, Dragon Helmet, Life
 Armor, Ivory Charm, Soul Gem
-Tell Rei use Jolt to kill off the other party members, tell Ryu to use an
 Hourglass, and tell [someone] to attack herself. Hopefully, Archmage will
 kill off either Rei or [someone] rather than Ryu. If all goes well, this
 should be how the remainder of the battle should commence:
 Turn 1: Hourglass
 Turn 2: Switch Ivory Charm and Soul Gem for 2 Titan Belts; Attack
 Turn 3: Attack
 Turn 4: Hourglass
 Turn 5: Attack
 Turn 6: Attack
 Turn 7: Hourglass
 Turn 8: Attack
 Turn 9: Attack
 Turn 10: Hourglass
 Turn 11: Accession into IRT Kaiser
 Turn 12: Kaiser Breath
 Turn 13: (if he's not already dead) Kaiser Breath
-Before anybody asks, I'll answer the question: "Why didn't you use an IRT
 Kaiser's Bonebreak?" I didn't use it the last turn because it wasn't
 necessary for the kill. In fact, it would have just been overkill.
 I didn't use it earlier because... well... I don't really have a reason
 for that. I didn't use it to start the battle because it would not have
 been enough for the kill. I've used IRT Kaiser's Bonebreak on Archmage
 before under the exact same conditions, and it inflicted a little less than
 1/2 his total HP, otherwise a little less than 1500 HP (I think about 1300
 or 1400 damage). It wasn't enough for the kill.
-Anyway, it should be pretty obvious that this battle was incredibly easy
 (and cheap >_> <_<).

---------
Berserker: 15000 HP; Attacks: Fire Whip, Berserk
---------

A.Ryu
-Recommended Level: 49
-Recommended Formation: Attack
-Recommended Party: Rei, (irrelevant)
-Recommended Equipment: Royal Sword, Dragon Shield, Dragon Helmet, Life
 Armor, Ivory Charm, Soul Gem
-The Berserker is the real problem for Ryu. Put succinctly, he annihilated
 Ryu. It wasn't even close. Fortunately, I absorbed Fire Whip, but his
 regular attack is what posed the real threat. Even on IRT Kaiser, it
 inflicted over 200 damage, and most other dragon forms were killed from
 just one hit. I even exceeded the Soul Gem limit, just to see how far I
 would have to go using my method to defeat him. It actually went... ok...
 until that is he used Berserk. After that, I never got another chance to
 attack.
-At one point, I had decided to stick with standard Kaiser (only Infinity;
 both IRT and standard caused around 500 damage per attack) since I'll I'd
 be doing is attacking anyway. As I mentioned, most other forms were killed
 soon after transformation. That wasn't an effective method either.
-The 4 Hourglasses weren't too big a help either. I've calculated that even
 if I were to use them to their maximum damage potential, I probably
 wouldn't even take out 1/3 of his 15000 HP. And then I'd be left with no
 AP, and I'd be torn to shreds.
-I've considered switching to Defense Formation to considerably lessen the
 damage, but that would also prolong the battle and during that time he
 would assuredly eventually use Berserk. This means that I'd also be screwed
 in Defense Formation.
-I've also been considering using some form of a Behemoth (probably
 involving the Flame gene, though for AP purposes, I might leave out
 Thorn). I don't know how that will work out though.
-I'm having this much trouble only with Ryu. I can just imagine how the
 other characters will deal with this.
-Anyway, I'm trying to figure out how to deal with Berserker (for now,
 with Ryu anyway) and somehow stay within the boundaries of my own rules.
 If anybody has any suggestions or if I've looked over anything, please feel
 free to tell me. If nobody has any ideas, then I'll have to...

Do you have a question this guide hasen't answered? Just ask me, I'll give 
you your answer and post your question(s) here for anyone else who has a 
similar question. Of course, your privacy will be protected. Unless you say so
otherwise, I will not display your name/e-mail address to public eyes.

Q: Where can I power up Peco when I get him? He's at level 1, and all the
enemies in Eastern Wyndia are too strong for him.

A: Yeah, that is a bit of a problem. Especially since you have to go straight
to the Tournament afterwards. The best place to power up before you go is
probably Meryleep's Forest. There are a few strong enemies there, but it
generally has the weakest enemies. You only encounter goo enemies there. Just
pray you don't encounter a Goo King, as they do very rarely do appear there.

Q: Hey Rag, how does --------- SCC sound?

Alright, now I'm going to make a brief list of what is and what is 
not acceptable for an SCC.

Ordinary character SCCs with additional limitations are perfectly fine,
providing that they follow all the original rules as well.

Now, transformation only SCCs, or using one transformation constantly for
every battle, are a different story.

First off, don't bother trying a Weretiger or Berserk Kaiser SCCs. Have you
ever tried an Umaro SCC in Final Fantasy 6. They're something like that. The
only part of "battling" that involves you is healing after battles, and for
the Berserk Kaiser this would involve a trendemous of AP restoration.

Concerning dragon forms breaking, this is my judgment call on the issue: If
ordinary characters have 2 Soul Gems they can use for dying from lack of HP, 
then *dragon forms can have their forms break from a loss of all HP twice.
The dragon forms can break from a loss of all AP an unlimited number of
times.* However, you must restore the AP up to a desired level and then
transform back into that form. You are allowed to restore Ryu's HP during this
process, but you may not take any form of offensive action against the enemy
at this time of AP restoration. A couple more notes: There are no equipment
limitations for Ryu in this type of challenge, and I advise you choose your
equipment based off of the form you've chosen (though that was probably
fairly obvious).
