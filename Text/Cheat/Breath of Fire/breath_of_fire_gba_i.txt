Section 1 - U P D A T E S  - I'll be d***ed if I can keep this up-to-date
******************************************************************************

Version 0.92 (21/07/06) - OMG! It actually got released. Every bit of 
information I found with one play through of the game. Errors will be fixed, 
and missing things will be added, but right now, I'm very, very tired.

Version 0.95 (09/02/07) - Whoa. An update. How is THAT possible? Many people
sent me stuff (more then I thought would), and yeah, I figured I had to add
it in before my inbox crashes and I lose all their e-mails. I was not able to
do a grammar/spelling check yet, but I swear, you'll only need to cope with 
that for another couple of months.

Version 0.95b (03/15/09) - Reader updates, some additional stuff added, some
more spelling and grammer, started the Misc portion of the guide. I have fun
with these version numbers.

Section 2 - I N T R O D U C T I O N  - Skipped all the time
******************************************************************************

Hello everyone, welcome to my Breath of Fire guide.  I really hope I can get
this to become super useful for anyone that needs help, and better then the
ones already at GameFAQs.
I have made this guide using the GBA version.  I have played this game on both
systems, and could not recall any differences.  If there are any, please
notify me.

If you are new to the Breath of Fire series, then this game would probably be
the best one to start with.  I'm not going to provide an intro to the game,
considering that the game itself already does so.  So, let this go straight to
the info.
(Psst...If you're too idiotic to figure out the very simple game mechanics,
DO NOT ask me. I'm sure some other guide would love to help you.)

******************************************************************************
Section 3 - C H A R A C T E R S - Know your members!
******************************************************************************

=====================
RYU
---------------------
Height: 160 cm (5'3")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lbs)
Hobby: Fishing
---------------------
Ryu is the main character, and he'll be with you for the entire game. At an 
early age, Ryu lost his parents and lives only with his sister.  He is also 
part of the Dragon Clan, whose members can change into Dragons (didn't see 
that coming, did ya?) However, they had sealed their power away, as it had 
caused great destruction before in the Goddess War. But as the world falls 
into war yet again, perhaps the seal will be lifted...

Ryu is a good fighter. A really, really good fighter. If he's got the right
equipment, he'll be doing some pretty good damage all round the game. His 
Dragon magic will also help a load, because it increases defense and damage is
changed to be stronger and stable. Near the end of the game, Ryu can do away
with transforming though, as he may be doing 700+ on each hit with a regular
attack. He levels the slowest, but since he's there from the start, I doubt
it'll matter much. Very, very good character.

MISC. NOTE - The American version for the GBA default name is Zack, however,
considering it's Ryu for the Japanese version, and it WAS Ryu in the SNES,
I'll only refer to him as Ryu.

--------------------
Field Ability

Fishing - Ryu can fish for items if he has a Fishing Rod.  He may sometimes
pull out relics rather then just fish.

===================

NINA
-------------------
Height: 158 cm (5'2")
Weight: 45 kg (99 lbs)
Hobby: Eating things (This I can't confirm, what with her slim figure and all)
-------------------
The main female character of the game. She's the princess of the Wing Clan,
a group of people that grow wings on their back as they mature. Eventually,
they gain the power to fly, and even carry people on their backs. The clan 
does not participate in fighting, and hid during the Goddess War, so 
traditions are still intact. Nina has therefore learned healing magic.

Nina is a crappy fighter. She's really quick, but man, she deals crap damage
and can barely take hits. But that's fine. Her purpose isn't to fight. She's
got a slew of healing magic, so she'll be buffing up allies and healing them
when they get hurt. Make sure to stick her in the back row.
-------------------
Field Ability

Fly - Very late in the game, Nina will learn how to fly, and can bring the
party to nearly any place in the world

====================    

BO
-------------------
Height: 182 cm (6'0")
Weight: 87 kg (191 lbs)
Hobby: Traveling
-------------------
The ranger that joins after the General fiasco. He is a part of the Forest 
Clan, and was the leader of their armies. He fought many battles against the
Dark Dragons, and often leading his people to victory, but the Dark Dragons 
eventually forced them into retreat. He decides to try his luck at beating 
them by joining Ryu.

I loved Bo when I first got him. He had some spells to use, though his AP
hindered that ability to reach it's fullest. Still, blasts of 80 damage was
so awesome. And his regular attack rivaled Ryu's pretty closely. Unfortunately
when he started to level up quicker, his attack rise didn't compare to Karn
or Gobi. I ended up forgetting him and left him to be a fusion tool for Karn.
-------------------
Field Abilities

Forest Walk - If Bo is leading the group, the party can walk through trees on
the world map.
Hunting - Bo can shoot arrows. If they hit an animal, the animal will drop an
item.

Luck     -  8
(Can't give his in-depth stats because I don't understand the formulas and he
levelled on his first fight)
===================

KARN
-------------------
Height: 154 cm (5'1")
Weight: 48 kg (105 lbs)
Hobby: Acquiring shoes (Hehe)
-------------------
Thief that joins at the Krypt. As a young boy, he was found by the guild 
leader of Thieves in Bleak. Karn knows nothing about his past, though Karn
couldn't be any less curious. All he wants to do is become the best thief. The
leader had often wondered if he should tell Karn who he really is.

I disliked Karn when I first got him. Crappy damage, and that's all he could
do in battle. With complete lack of ability in battle, he wasn't a favourite.
However, when he started to level, his damage output raised, and his speed was
incredible. It only got better from there, with gaining his fusion spells.
-------------------
Field Ability

LockPicking - Any gate that has a lock on it can be opened if Karn is at the
front.
Trap Search - Karn can detect any holes in the floor.
Disarm Trap - Any trap can be removed if Karn opens the treasure chest.

===================

GOBI
-------------------
Height: 173 cm (5'8")
Weight: 110 kg (242 lbs)
Hobby: Making money
-------------------
He is a part of the Clan of Traders, of a species called Manillos. They are 
great salesmen and aim to control the entire world's commerce. Currently, they
are found running shops in any town that is beside the ocean. They are known
for their greed, however, Gobi was so filled with avarice that his own clan
disliked him, going to the extent of removing him from the clan and forbidding
him to use a sphere. These spheres let Manillos become giant fish, speeding up
travels and allowing for more trade. This limited Gobi's trading life greatly,
however, he still tries to make any situation as profitable as possible.

I dislike Gobi. I don't know why, I just do. I guess I never really gave him
the attention he needs. If you actually level him, he might turn out to be a
good fighter with average strength and vigor. His spells are downright crappy
for limited usage.
-------------------
Field Ability

Big Fish - A while after you get him, Gobi will be found worthy of the sphere.
This will let you travel underwater at a much quicker pace and elminate random
encounters. Also, some areas are now traversible.

===================

OX
-------------------
Height: 250 cm (8'2")
Weight: 200 kg (440 lbs)
Hobby: Cooking 
-------------------
A member of the Iron Ogres. These people resemble oxen, and are large and 
powerful beings. They are even strong enough to destroy weak walls or 
boulders. They can craft weaponry and armour with such skill that the ability
is traced back to ancient times. Though they have these powers, they are not
clutzy, and can do delicate works. Contrary to their size, power, and ability,
the Iron Ogres detest fighting, and try to leave it out whenever possible. 
This makes their smithing a rare used skill.

Ox...what can I say? A fusion tool for Karn is probably it. I mean, he has
hyper attack power (for the sheer strength of his equipment), high vigor for
defense, but god, he's slow as a slug. He has limited magic usage, and well, 
you'll get more attack power when you fuse. So, really, I never liked using
him. He's not bad though, if you can handle having him go last every battle.
-------------------
Field Ability

Smash - Ox can destroy crumbling walls and rocks in your path. He can also
smack fruits out of trees on the overworld.

===================

BLEU
-------------------
Height: Unknown.
Weight: Unknown.
(That's funny, someone should be able to make a guess by looking at her.)
-------------------
The sorceress is a legend among the clans. No one has any idea how long she 
has been around, lying in a sleep spell. Her story has circled about for many
years. But finally comes a time where she needs to wake again and lend her
powers to the hero. However, the coma has had it's effects on her, so she will
need experience before remembering all her spells.

We all know the generic spell-caster: weak in physical offence and defense, 
but absolutely KILLER when it comes to magic. And that's what Bleu is. 
Needless to say, she can dish out some pretty good damage. However, she'll 
suffer greatly when she has no more AP, so pack some mana restoratives with
you. She won't be of much use in random encounters if you're an AP conserver.
-------------------
Field Ability

None - Bleu can't do jack-squat when she isn't fighting.

===================

MOGU
-------------------
Height: 83 cm (2'9")
Weight: 32 kg (70 lbs)
Hobby: Ancient studies
-------------------
Mogu's clan is secretive. They live underneath the land, and have kept to 
themselves, not making any noteworthy heroes to the other clans. All of heard
of their special skill, however. They are known to be able to dig very deep
into the ground. Mogu himself is a shy person, but will fight when he needs 
to.

I hate Mogu. Even more the Gobi. Why? Well, first off, I can't even call him
a fusion tool. He doesn't have much HP, his skill (in battle) is pretty 
useless, and his defense is not that good. He's got average speed and higher
attack power, but heck, why bother? You might as well use Ox if you're not 
using a Karn Fusion as he's much more survivable, and he's got a much better
attack rating. They shoulda made him an NPC, or an item. That way, we can dig
without having to share EXP.
-------------------
Field Ability

Dig - On patches of land with a dragon mark, Mogu can dig into it to reveal
a room, that may contain items, or even people.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Location : Drogen
Party Members : Ryu
Items : V.Ptn, 300GP
Enemies : None


The story starts with a Dragon, and someone calling you to get up.  Then you
realize you've been sleeping through a fire! Once you gain control, start
moving out.  But wait! There's a drawer! There's always time for treasure,
right?  Receive V.Ptn. Proceed to where the old woman is. She'll move ahead 
when you get close.  Continue to follow, and a wall of flame will seperate you
from her.  She'll put it out with some magic so you can continue.  Follow her 
down the stairs.

Hm, that's funny. There's NO fire here! What gives? The fire came from the
sky? Talk to everyone here. Talk to the old woman, and she'll say that this
building is safe from fire.  Uh, hello? The upper half is burning like heck!
In any case, talk to everyone else.  Most will just say that the fire is crazy
and that they should leave before Esma (the old lady) can't hold it back
anymore.  However, the woman in the center gives a name in red: Sara. And we
all know names in red are important, right?

Once you finished talking to everyone, a cutscene will occur. A common man,
and a woman with a unique sprite (gotta know she's important) will run in,
proclaiming that the Dark Dragons are here.  And you'll get a lot of new info
with a lot of names in red. The Dark Dragons fight against the other Dragon
families.  Their King is named Zog, and wants to rule the world, targetting
the Light Dragons first. Then a "Why is he attacking us?" So from that, you
can probably figure out that you're in the Light Dragons.  But Esma explains
that he fears them, since he doesn't know that they lost the Power of
the Dragon.  Now, the elder man says to go out and fight back. Sure, let's 
go out and kill ourselves!

The voice of reason comes out from the girl with the unique sprite. But the
Light Dragons refuse to give up.  They beckon her to join them in their 
suicide party. Through that, you learn that she's Sara. But she says that she 
must do this on her own.  Sara proceeds to blast the guy with magic, turning 
him to stone. Then she'll petrify EVERYONE in the room, including you. Before 
she leaves, Sara tells you that you'll bring peace to the land when you're a 
warrior.

She'll go out, talk to herself, and get caught.  She talks to the commander
(Jade) a bit, but then she'll scare away all the weakling soldiers with 
massive bolts of lightning.  Sara'll try to blast Jade directly, but he proves
to be too quick.  All the while she's shooting and he's dodging, they'll talk
about some nonsense, but then reach the red font words : The Goddess Keys.
Sara asks what they're planning to do with Tyr, but Jade does not answer.
He then blasts smoke (Oh yeah, that'll be super-effective) at Sara, but she
avoids.  Sara then shoots fire, which connects. But Jade is completely
unharmed.

Then the legend appears.  I don't feel like typing it out, so read it for
yourselves.  Though, note that Jade appears for a moment as the soldiers
search for the other dragons.  Doesn't look like Sara won.  Also note that
their search parties absolutely suck.  Everybody was gathered in a single
building, and they didn't even check inside.

Afterwards, everyone is freed from the stone enchantment.  The villagers say
that they should fight, but the two elders refuse to give them the option.
They get so pesky and annoying that Esma strikes the room with an Earthquake
to scare 'em off. However, they know how adamant Ryu will be, and they give
him their permission to save the world.  Also, they make a chest appear.
Receive 300GP!

Now you can travel the remains of Drogen.  You can go back to Esma to heal for
free.  There's a Dragon Shrine, remained unharmed by the Dark Dragons, where
you can save. There's also an Item Shop, and an Equipment Store.

Shops

ITEM            EQUIPMENT

Cure   - 1800G  HairBand - 1000G
                SilkGN   - 2800G

At this point, I wouldn't recommend any items, other then some packs of herbs
and antidotes.  New equipment will arrive very soon.  

After shopping, exit Drogen.  Let's begin our journey, shall we?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map (Drogen Area)
Party: Ryu
Items: None
Enemies: Flea, Bulla, Slime

Here we are, the world.  The place where your characters all of a sudden gain
8 league boots. Wander around to find some enemies.  Fleas and Bullas will lay
some serious hurt on you right now, so don't fight them if they're in groups.
Slimes should do until Level 2. Stay close to Drogen so you can go back and 
heal and save often.  I'd recommend training until level 4 or so. Once you
level to your hearts' content, heal and save one more time, then head through
the only path given.  You'll reach a castle eventually. Enter!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Camlon
Party: Ryu
Items: None
Enemies: None

First things first, run to the Dragon Shrine and save. Now survey the area.

You know, these people are misleading. At first entry, I thought this place
was Nanai, because everyone says it's their hometown and how the Dark Dragons
invaded it. This place certainly has been invaded, and it did seem like their
home, but one guy says that he was chased OUT OF Nanai. Also, this other 
person knows your name.  Creepy.  In any case, talking to the people in front 
of the castle will inform you that the castle has been taken over by monsters.
No one here is strong enough to get rid of them. So, who's job has it become? 
Enter the castle!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Camlon Castle
Party: Ryu
Items: 70GP(x2), Herb (x5), BronzSD, Gauntlet, SuedeCP, Visor, Antdt(x2),
150GP.
Enemies: Beak, P.Bug, Gloom, Creep

Woo, first dungeon!  Proceed forward, taking the only path the game allows.
The other paths have conveniently been blocked by rubble.  Eventually, you'll
hit a spring of blue water.  Drinking from it restores Ryu to full HP. Funny,
you would have thought the monsters polluted the water already. In any case,
this will allow a beautiful time to buff up your levels again.  Fight, drink,
repeat.  Do so until you find you're strong enough to take the enemies here
with ease.

While you do that, I'll explain some cruel opponents.  P.Bugs have the ability
to poison Ryu, which will make him all funky coloured, plus it'll damage you
over time. Drink from the spring, or if you listened to me, use one of those
Antidotes.  Next is the Gloom, who can strike with a T.Bolt spell, causing 12
damage. Pretty hefty at this point in the game, so be wary.

Alright, move along the still-one-option path, and you'll come across a
small room with two chests.  Receive two sets of 70GP! Another spring is also
near here. So, technically, you can also level here.

Continuing on no-choice lane will eventually bring you to a set of stairs.
Proceed to Floor 2 of this castle.  You'll find a large gate with two chests
behind it. How to get the spoils? Press A, and the door will open. God, crappy
security, huh? Receive Herb and BronzSD! Equip for an upgrade in damage.
Moving on, past the big open space of nothing special, you'll find another
gate, waiting to be opened by anyone who passes. Open the two chests. Receive
Herb and Gauntlet! Equip this as well.

Go up the stairs to be back on Floor 1, and walk to the next set of stairs
leading down.  The path beyond is blocked off, so go down these stairs. Yay,
more easy to open gates filled with goodies. Receive SuedeCP and Herb from the
first set and Herb and Visor from the second. Equip the Visor and SuedeCP.
Head up the stairs.

Going through the path, two more chests are here! Open the first one. Oh no!
It was a trap! But...you recover all HP and AP? Eh, I'll take it! Also,
receive Antdt. Open the other one. This was trapped as well, and it reduces
Ryu's AP to 1. Eh, he doesn't use spells anyway. Receive another Antdt. Head
up the stairs.

Oo, torches. Step right up, to find the leader is...a frog? Hah, losers.
Couldn't take care of something this...Oh.  The frog gets angry and transforms
into a large mutant creature that slightly resembles its original form. Not
very, though.  Engage!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Frog
HP : 180
AT : 20
EX : 500
GO : 350
Actions : Glob Shot, Tongue Lash, Lunge (All regular attacks, just different
animations). Recover (10HP).
============================
GlobShot and TongueLash does 5-8 damage.
Lunge does 8-11 damage.
He's not too tough. At level 5, I got him down to his second wind before even 
healing once. At this point of time, you have no variety in options, so do the
only thing you can do: Attack. If you're slower then he is, heal with an herb
when you're at about 15HP, if you're quicker, heal right before you're going
to die. These are approximations, you never know when he might hit for a high 
damage lunge. Still, he's easy to take down.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

I levelled up three times after fighting him. After he's dead, the foul air is
gone and fresh air comes in. Goodbye, random encounters in this castle! Before
you leave, go out to the side to find two treasure chests. Receive 150GP and
(Yet again) an Herb. Leaving will be very easy, since monsters are now
non-existant. Return to...

People outside will start to acknowledge you, finding you to be a true hero.
They also note your scar (Ryu has a scar? Never saw that before...Oh wait!
It's the thing on his forehead!). But all is interuppted with an Earthquake.
They'll say the Dark Dragons have the Quake Control, and you should go to
Nanai to find it. Just saved your castle, the least you could do is say 
"Thank you." But no, you gotta send me on another quest.

Heck, no one says thanks in the entire town! You learn a bit more about the
Quake Control from one of the royal men. The other says to sneak in Nanai at
night (he says "Let's" but doesn't move from where he stands). People admire
your ability now, but there isn't a "thank you" in sight. Ah well, thems the 
breaks. Save, and head out for Nanai.

Well, seeing as how the other places are blocked off by forest, you have no
choice but to go to Nanai.  Enemies shouldn't be a problem, thanks to the 
heaps of EXP Frog gave us. Once you reach the castle, wait until it's night
time, then enter.

Party: Ryu
Items: S.Ptn, 150GP(x2), Herb(x2)

Okay, as you heard from the folks at Camlon, this place has been taken over by
the Dark Dragons.  You gotta stealthily avoid the guards to get to the castle.
Proceed upward to the Dragon Shrine and save. Then go inside the Inn next door
and take the S.Ptn in their drawer. Exit and head behind large house. You
should find a sleeping guard infront of another house. Enter the building to 
the right of that one and open the chests. Receive 150GP times two.

Exit and head down, past the small house and item shop.  You'll be near the
pub with another sleeping guard. You can then travel straight across to the
right and head up to reach the Equipment Store.

EQUIPMENT
IronRP   - 1800G
LongSD   - 2250G
Cloth    -    9G
SuedeSH  -  135G
SuedeCP  -  216G
WoodSH   -  270G
HairBand -  900G
SilkGN   - 2520G

Whoa, did prices just skyrocket? Well, Nanai sells some of the stuff Drogen
sells at a better price, but the new equipment costs a whack more. I'm pretty
sure you don't have enough for a shiny new Long Sword. Luckily, that looks
like the only thing we have on our "to buy" list. If you do have enough, by 
all means, buy and equip. Also, sell your old stuff. Anyway, exit.

Head up and around the small pond, as there's a guard hiding behind the small 
house where the other guard is sleeping. Continue heading up to hit three 
houses side by side. Enter the one on the far right. Raid the two chests.
Receive Herb times two. Exit the house.

Alright, we raided the town for what it's worth, let's get to that Quake 
Control. Head back to the pub (remember to go around the pond), and head up. 
Make sure you're hugging the right line of the bridge so the guard won't catch
you.  Enter the large castle like thing.

There isn't anything of interest around here, so go straight into the dungeon.
The gate blocks the stairs, so work your lockpicking magic on it. Heading down
the steps will bring you to...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gaia Temple
Party: Ryu
Items: Antdt, 650GP, B.Stn, ArmPad, 70GP, F.Stn, Cure.
Enemies: P.Bug, Gloom, Beak

(NOTE: Since there isn't a way to heal in the dungeon, pack some herbs)

Here we are, the place with the Quake Control. Continuously head down the 
stairs and you'll arrive in a large area with (what I'm guessing to be) lava 
in the background. Or red smoke or something, I really don't know. In any 
case, go straight to the right and down the small ramp to find a treasure 
chest. Receive Antdt.  Head back to the left, and this time go down and across
the rope bridge. Going to the far left will bring you to a mound. Walk up, and
through another rope bridge. You'll see a chest. Receive 650GP (You
should have enough for that LongSD now. Go get it).

Go all the back down, and head all the way to the right.  Another chest is
visible. Receive B.Stn. Go a little to the left and go up the mounds here.
Cross the two rope bridges, and that will bring you to a set of stairs.
Keep going down all the stairs you see.

Hello, floor 2. Head off to the right, crossing the mini-rope bridge, and you
will see two chests, one north and one south. Receive ArmPad and 70GP,
respectively. Equip the ArmPad.  Crossing over to the left from the 70GP box
will bring you to a rope bridge. Follow the path, and head down the little
ramp. A chest should be here. Receive F.Stn.

Backtrack up the mound, and head to the right this time. You'll spot another
chest. Raid it! Receive Cure. After getting that, head down the ramp, and go
along the single path given, crossing the rope bridge, going down the mound,
up the other mound and down the stairs.

Here we are, the bottom of Gaia Temple. Where did all the lava / smoke go, I
wonder? Head along the path, to find a block of stone and a Knight in front of
it. Heal before you approach him, because he's going to be angry and attack
you.

! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
============================
Knight
HP : 700
AT : 45
EX : 700
GO : 500
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(20), Recover(40)
============================
His physical attack does 8-9 damage (Funny, I thought it was set at 8, until
he struck a 9)
Not that hard, but he gets pretty annoying when he's low on HP because he 
starts to recover. Since it's all you can do, attack non-stop until he drops
your HP to 20 or below. You should heal with an herb when that happens. Also
you can use that F.Stn and B.Stn you picked up early and let them loose for
a pretty hefty blow. He'll fall eventually.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Hah, that wasn't too tough, was it? After you beat him, he'll freak out and
explode. Last I checked, that wasn't how regular humans died, but oh well.
Him aside, walk up to the machine, and steal the key. Obtain E.Key! 
Everything will go all shaky, so run to the flashy circle on the right of the 
machine. 

You'll be teleported outside. How convenient. And you'll witness the 
destruction of Nanai. Didn't expect that, now did you? Ohmygod! You just
killed the weapons merchant! Ohmygod again! The man DID come here, but he's 
like, soooo late! And it doesn't seem like he figured out that you just blew 
up a fortress. He'll bring you to the king.

Even more convenient. You'll be brought back to Camlon without a walk or 
encounter. The king will say you gave up Nanai to beat the Dark Dragons (Oh
yeah, I totally knew taking that key would cause massive destruction, eheh)
He now sees you as an (even more then before) true hero. The other royal man
will point you to Winlan.

Everyone will now give you good lucks and ask for your safety. Still no thank
you. And the idiot at the entrance didn't figure out that their hometown got
blown up. But anyway, run into the castle and heal up at the spring, then save
at the shrine. We're Winlan-bound.

With Nanai blown to ashes (it's seriously ashes, you can't even enter to see
the ruins like you could with Drogen and Camlon), we can now pass by to the 
land beyond. Awesome.

Oh wait, before I forget, that E.Key you picked up? It's not just a useless
quest item. Use it in battle to activate the spell 3.5, which does 30 damage
to every enemy that isn't airborne (Supposedly. Airborne enemies still get hit
for some reason...). Totally sweet.

Anyway, once you get to the ashes, head off to the east until you hit the
ocean, then head north.  There'll be a path eventually, which you can follow
straight to Winlan. Onto...

Welcome to Winlan, the place where everyone has wings! As per usual, first
things first, save at the shrine. Now let's explore!

Beside the shrine is the Inn, and on the other side is a house with nothing
important. Heading up will bring you to an intersection. Heading to the right
will show you an unfinished bridge and a house. Go inside and raid the drawer.
Receive V.Ptn.

Go all the way to the left, and you'll find yourself an item shop, and an
equipment store.  Now that we're there, I can list the prices for everything
buyable in Winlan.

Inn: 80G

ITEM             EQUIPMENT
Mrbl3  -   10G   Sabre   -  400G
Herb   -   10G   BronzSD -  700G
Antdt  -   15G   BronzRP -  800G

Acorn  -   30G   WoodSH  -  300G
Charm  -  150G   SuedeGN -  500G
Life   -  500G   Visor   -  800G
Cure   - 2000G   ChainML - 2000G

As you can see, they jacked-up the prices on items. Uncool. And look at the
Inn price! Last time it was free! Ah well...keep your money for now, even if
you do have enough for something. Also, you now have a storage! You can access
it in the item shop, by talking to the man there.

Talk to everyone for many useful tid-bits of info. Read it for yourselves.
After finishing up all your business in Winlan, head into the castle. Talk to
all the guards for some more information. Then talk to the lady. You'll
trigger a small cutscene, with talk of the King having been poisoned, and how
the princess plans to get the remedy on her own.

After that, the lady will bring Ryu to the guest rooms to go sleep. And sleep
he does. And whilst he's doing that, you'll gain control of...

Yeah, a new member! Say hello to Nina. She isn't a fighter, but she is pretty
important to a party's survival. And it's very strange how she just acquired
Ryu's inventory. Anyway, run around this floor and you'll find the king and 
his attendants eventually. Talk to them for some more information on the 
king's illness and the wizard in Karma (heh, funny name). After that, head 
downstairs.

You'll be on ground floor. The guards will tell you that the gates are open.
If you want, you can talk to Ryu, too. He's sleeping, but you'll get more then
"zzz" out of him. Going to the left of the stairs will bring you to a metal
gate, which you can open up for four chests. Receive Herb, Antdt, SuedeSH, and
SuedeHT. Equip them.

Leave that room, and go back to the intersection, this time heading up. Go 
right by the ponds and the stairs, and there should be another room with two
chests. Receive two Herbs. Head downstairs.

There'll be a bunch of people running about. Everyone will only ask why Nina's
up this late, but there's the guards from earlier down here too. They say the
same thing to Nina that they did to Ryu, but just in case you need a refresh.
Also, the second room on the left has two chests for your taking. Receive
Antdt and Herb. Castle pillaged, let's head into town.

If you haven't noticed already, Nina has terrible equipment. I mean, god, her
dress's weight is 25, for 8 defense! If you somehow managed to plan ahead of
time, you can equip her with an IronRP, a SilkGN, and a HairBand. Though, I 
highly doubt you would have had the money at the time you could buy those. 
You can get her a BronzRP from the weaponry. You'll need to deal with the 
Dress a bit longer, but I assure you, it'll be gone soon enough. Though, if 
you've equipped her with everything so far, her active will be one. Gee, what 
a fun way to stary a character who's supposed to be fast.

With that done, let's head into the world.

(NOTE: If you come back here when it's day time, the royal men in the basement
have useful bits of info)

Head into the cave on the west. Very short walk.

SIDE VISIT (Wouldn't call it a quest, really) - If you want, you could travel 
to Drogen for that HairBand and SilkGN. I don't think you'll have the money 
for both, but if you are going there, pay Camlon a visit. Next section is for
that. Skip until Aura Cave if you're not going back there.

Nina, and it's a mini-kingdom. 

Alright, I'm done being in awe, and I hope you are too. Let's steal! The house
beside the item shop has a drawer. Receive Mrbl1. The house behind the item
shop also has a drawer. Receive ProtnA. Travel across to the right and you'll
find yourself at a hay roof house, with a drawer. Receive W.Ptn. And the house
beside it has one too, on the second level. Receive DkKiss.

Stealing aside, let's check their stores and see what we can buy.

Camlon's people rock. Discounts everywhere! And the inn price! Though, you can
heal for free in the castle with their healing water, but still, the inn price
IS as low as possible that still requires payment. If only they had equipment.
The people outside still don't seem that grateful, 'till you talk to the man
in the middle. They're building a statue to honour the hero! Cool. The King
is also more grateful as well. Heh, guess I didn't need a thank you after all.
Let's get to Drogen now.

Party: Nina, Sr-1, Sr-2
Items: Cure, 150GP, SuedeGN, 70GP, I.Ore, Herb(x2), B.Stn, C.Stn
Enemies: Gloom, Beak, Creep

When you move up a teensy bit, you'll be greeted by some soldiers. Who want to
join you, because they know Nina will never make it on her own. Also, you
can't refuse their help. You can try, but they'll ask again. But why would 
you, anyway? Nina sucks on her own. New members, get!

Soldier number two is, in all ways, better then soldier one. But eh, both 
together is good. Not much is needed to explain their abilities. They have no
magic, so all they can do is attack and use items.

Move up and go continuously down the stairs. This place sure looks a lot like
Gaia Temple, except it's water in the background. Anyway, go down the hill 
and to the right for a treasure box. Receive Cure. Keep going right, and down
a bit to find yourself near two chests, one at the top of the hill, and 
another at the foot. Receive 150GP and SuedeGN, respectively. Equip the 
SuedeGN on Nina immediately to result in a MAJOR speed boost. Back track to 
the intersection and head up this time. There will be a mound with a chest on
it. Receive 70GP. Head off to the left, and there will be another chest. 
Obtain I.Ore! Make sure you get this, as it will be important later.

Go back all the way to the stairs. This time, head up and across the rope 
bridge. A chest will be plain in sight. Receive Herb. Again, only one option
is given, so follow the path. Once you cross the second rope bridge, head down
the ramps and you'll find a chest. Receive Herb. Continue and you'll reach a
set of stairs. Don't go up just yet, instead, head across to the left and down
the hill. Go up and you'll see more treasure. Receive B.Stn. 

Now go up those stairs. Head upward, and walk to the left when you get the 
chance. Yay, one more box. Receive C.Stn. Go up the stairs, and head outside.

Items: PrtnB, L.Ptn, Map
Enemies: None.

This place is weird. Save at the shrine, and talk to the people. You'll learn
that they are, in fact, undead, and they were resurrected by the Remedy of the
Wizard of Karma (Or you'll learn OF the undead, if you came here during the 
day). Dang, I wouldn't feel safe giving this to my dying dad. Heck, the only 
reason I can see it working is because I give it to him after the poison kills
him. They'll also say how the young female members are missing.

Anyway, pillaging. Romero doesn't have much to take, actually. Visit the tall
yellow house in the top-right corner and go up to the second floor to find a
drawer. Receive PrtnB. Go into the inn and check the drawer. Receive L.Ptn . 
Go into the small yellow house behind the Inn. There will be a hole in the 
ground which you can jump into, so do so. Secret Underground Base! There will 
be a gate which is ACTUALLY LOCKED, so no peeking in there, just yet. There 
will also be a couple of jars. Move 'em in the proper pattern, and you'll get 
to the barrel. Move the barrel and press A on the spot it was on. Obtain Map! 
Press Start when you're on the World Map, and well, you'll get a world map of 
everywhere you have visited. If only they gave the names of the places too.

Let's check out the shops now.

Items: Herb(x3), 150G, Bandage, A.Ptn
Enemies: Creep, P.Bug, Spider

(Mushrooms on the map are edible. They'll recover health, but some are poison.
They don't give you poison status though)

My first playthrough in these woods was terrible. I hated this place. Most of
the things here, you probably don't want. Most people will skip everything but
the bandage. However, because I'm a perfectionist, I'll include directions to 
every item. It will be very difficult to follow, so bear with me. If you just 
want the good items, the bottom of this section has easier to follow 
guidelines.

Head to the right until you hit an intersection, then take the road north. A 
chest is here. Receive Herb. Get back to the intersection and head west. Once
there's another intersection (I'll call this one the main), head upward and
there will be a choice of north or west. Follow the paths north. The path will
curve to the left and you'll be at a chest. Receive 150G.

Backtrack to the last intersection you were at, and take the west road. You'll
hit another box. Receive Herb. Backtrack all the way to the main crossroad 
from the entrance, and take the path south. There will be small grove with a 
lone tree in the center. Behind the tree is a cleverly hidden chest. Receive
Herb. Head down from that spot, and left a little to find a chest in the open.
Receive Bandage. Equip on Nina this instant.

Return to the main crossroad, and take the west path. Follow the path, and 
then you'll find another grove a bit north of the road. It's got a lone tree
in the middle, with a chest behind it. Receive A.Ptn. Continue west along the
road, and you're homefree.

Alright, simplistic. Head west from the entrance, and only west until you get
the option of heading west, north and south. Take the south, and follow the
curving path and you'll be at a box. Receive Bandage. Backtrack to the 
crossroads, and head west. You're done.

Now, let's kick the Karma Wizard's butt for making me go through that.

When you enter, head forward, and you'll see two healing springs relatively 
close by each other. Heal up, and head down the steps. Take the two chests 
there. Receive two Herbs. Go back up, and head off to the left. You'll see a
set of stairs you can access, so go up them to find yourself at another box.
Receive M.Drop. Go back downstairs, and head around the top of the room, to 
reach the right side of the floor. Start going down while hugging the wall, 
and you'll see a chest. Receive M.Drop. I'm sure you saw this death look alike
earlier. So, let's beat him up.


*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Morte
HP: 120
AT: 65
EX: 336
GO: 240
Actions: Attack
Drops: M.Drop
============================
He does 15-25 damage.
(Technically, a mini-boss, but eh)
Do you hear that? The Grim Reaper's calling! But man, what a wuss. His regular
attacks do hyped up damage to anyone on the front row, but he can barely take
a hit himself. Nina should use the E.Key every turn while the soldiers attack.
5 turns, and this guy is done. If someone gets low HP, have Nina heal and one
of the soldiers use the key.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Re-heal, and head upstairs. 

Once you're on the second level, go south, and you'll find a set of stairs 
going up. Heading up will bring you to a chest. Receive Cure. Go back down, 
and go south, there will be a set of stairs leading down to a chest. Receive
Charm. Go back up, and go north around the floor. You'll hit another set of
stairs leading up. Go up them.

On this floor, circle around to the left and head down to find a chest. 
Receive Charm. Head back north, and follow the path around the entire floor.
You'll reach yet another set of stairs. Head down, and head forward to find
two holes in floor and stairs leading up. Go up the stairs to find a treasure
chest. Receive Herb. You'll also see four holes in the ground. Drop into
the one on the top right, and it'll bring you into a room with one hole and
stairs. Go up 'em, and go up the ones after that until you reach another
reaper figure and stairs that goes down.

Take the set that goes down, and the stairs after. You'll reach a chest. 
Receive Life2. Go back up all the stairs to reach the death figure again. 
Greet her.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Mortea
HP: 230
AT: 90
EX: 336
GO: 240
Actions: Attack
Drops: Herb
============================
She does 19-36 damage.
(Technically, a mini-boss, but eh)
Mortea's not happy that you owned her brother, and she'll take her shot at
taking you out. But of course, it's futile. She does have a better attack 
score then Morte by alot, but it doesn't matter much with the E.Key. Do watch 
your characters health, though, and be careful to not have anyone die.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

With her out of the way, we can go up those stairs she was guarding. You'll be
in a big room, with buttons on the left side. Press them, and watch as a 
magical bridge appears. Gaze in awe as it disappears behind you! You'll also
see a group of women, who all say the same thing. Open the purple gate with
your thief skills, and flip the switch. They'll clear a path for you. You can
now go downstairs. Though, go up stairs first, to save and heal.

One girl thanks you, the other is in a rush, and the other will tip you off to
go downstairs. Do so, and take the chest you'll soon see. Receive Cure. Keep
heading down, and you'll find yourself in a room different then the other
places here. Take a couple steps and the Wizard finds you out. He's pissed off
that you released his specimens, and unleashes a barrel full of Xeon Gas.

You'll engage in a battle with everyone at one HP, and Nina has only one AP as
well. You can attack him out of spite, but it won't do any good. (MISC- You
can recover everyone to full with a M.Drop, but that annoying message will
still pop up. Lame.) Eventually, they'll realize it's useless to try and fight
so Nina and one of the soldiers let the other escape to get help while they
hold the wizard off. You'll re-engage, but now the Wizard will use his Freeze 
and T.Bolt spells to quickly wipe out Nina and the soldier.

Meanwhile, the other soldier makes it to the roof of the tower. The wizard
will come in close after, but the soldier becomes a bird and flies away. 
However, minions are still chasing after him.

So many problems here. For starters, if the soldier could change into a bird
and fly to Winlan, why the heck didn't he do it to get to Karma? And another,
where in the world did the Wizard get access the dragons that won't tear him
limb from limb? Gah.

Anyway, the soldier makes it back to Winlan to alert everyone there that the
Princess has been captured. He then dies (very undramatic). The guards decide
that since they can't get by the Xeon Gas, they'll get the traveler that
happened by to help them.

The guard comes in to talk with Ryu.
"Hey man, our princess got kidnapped by a wizard, wanna save her?"
"Sure, okay!"
GOD! Some scenes just don't work out. Anyway, that's basically how the guard
approaches Ryu. If you say no, he'll tell you about the gas that takes 
strength from their people. And he'll ask again. Lame. Well, since you have no
choice, it's Ryu to the rescue!

Anyway, before you exit town, buy Ryu ChainML, as you should have enough by 
now (He magically reacquired all his stuff back from Nina). Now, join the 
rescue party outside town. Talk to the red one, and he'll become a bird for
Ryu to ride on. Three others will follow suit, and a partner will jump on
their back. They'll fly to Karma, but the Dragons (where the hell...) will 
block most of the party off. The leader with Ryu makes it through, and will
end up on the top of Karma. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Karma
Party: Ryu, Sr-3
Items: Foil (Rang)
Enemies: P.Bug, Spider, Creep, Gloom, Beak, Zard

The soldier will be in your party for a very limited time. Head downstairs
to the Dragon Statue and the Healing Spring. Save if you need to, then
head down all the flights of stairs until you reach the room with the Wizard
inside. The soldier will say that he won't be of any use if he goes with you,
and he'll leave the party. Ah well, didn't need him anyway.

Head south, and go due west. There's an weapon you can get here, so don't 
fight straight off. Just keep going west, and that'll bring you to a path 
north. Follow it and you'll find your treasure. Receive Foil (Rang in the SNES
version). This is weaker then your long sword, but it can attack all enemies.
However, since you're going to be fighting against the Wizard one-on-one, keep
your sword on. Backtrack to where you had the option of going north, and do so
this time.

You'll run into the Wizard, who immediately sees that you are from the Dragon
Clan. And let's show him our power, shall we?

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Wizard
HP: 180
AT: 40
EX: 1000
GO: 700
Actions: Freeze(15), T.Bolt(10), Petrify
============================
Wow, this is new, an opponent with no physical attacks. Anyway, strike the 
hell out of him with your sword until he uses Petrify. Once he does that,
start using your reliable E.Key. Heal if your HP gets to 30 or below (he's
faster then you are, so best to heal early).
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Woot, Wizard's butt gets handed to him. He'll cry on how he couldn't complete
his immortality potion, freak out, explode, and drop the Remedy. I knew he 
wasn't human, so that's perfectly fine if that's how he goes. Nina will thank
Ryu, then faint, forcing him to carry her up the stairs. She'll conveniently 
regain consciousness when they hit the roof. Soldier number three gives you a
lift back to Winlan. Yay for no long treks through a twisted forest, undead 
city, and cave of uh, auras.

Though, dang, they do some pretty unnecessary aerial tricks on their way back.
Ah well, if they're this happy that they saved the princess, might as well let
them have their fun. Eventually, they'll get you to Winlan.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Winlan
Party: Ryu, Nina
Items: None
Enemies: None

Nina won't waste any time running to the king to give him the remedy. Ryu
quickly follows behind her.

And Winlan's people are nice. They actually thank you. Though, that means I 
can't expect any statues. Hehe. Anyway, make your way to the King. Nina will
tell you that the Remedy isn't working. Well, it's to be expected, what with
it having flown off the Wizards' exploding body and all. I'm pretty sure that
undead potions don't cure poison either.

What the hey? He's like, completely revived. Hm...guess undead potions can
do anything. OHMYGOD, Ryu can talk when he's conscious! He'll ask for passage
through the tunnel. Nina will also force herself into his company. And the 
King doesn't give much of a fight of holding her back. Ah well. Nina joins the
party! I'd suggest healing at the inn before you continue any further for now.

Head to the basement and go talk to the guards. They'll move to let you by.
Cross the long bridge, and you'll be at the world map. Onto...

There's going to a slew of new opponents to face. Equip Ryu with the Foil
(Rang) to let him attack all enemies, and have Nina use the E.Key. You 
shouldn't run into much trouble.

From the bridge, head south. Follow the path, and once you head down a rampish
thing, go a little to the east and continue south. You'll see a village 
eventually. Enter.

Welcome to Tuntar, home of the Wood Clan. The place is messed up right now
because there isn't any water in the river, and obviously, they need the 
water. Let's check out their shops.

Inn: 60G

EQUIPMENT
Sabre   -  400G
BronzRP -  800G
ShortBW - 1000G
Scythe  - 1200G
Bandana -  400G
BronzSH -  500G
SuedeAR -  750G
Visor   -  800G

Crappity crap stuff they sell here. Your LongSD is stronger then the scythe
by quite a bit. Your ChainML is lighter and provides more DEF. And you already
have a Visor and a Gauntlet which is better then a BronzSH. The only thing 
here would probably be a bandana for Nina if you didn't get her a HairBand, 
but I did, so...

Let's see what we can take. Head into the inn, and find the dresser. Receive
Charm. Head into the Mayor's house (the tall building apart from everywhere
else) and go up to the second floor to find another dresser. Receive W.Ptn.
That's all. Raids haven't been doing too well lately.

Also, take a visit to the stone house near the bottom of the village. Talk to
the man there, and agree to give him your I.Ore for a Saw. Obtain Saw! We can
use this to get into the Forest of Despair! Though, we got no reason to go.
Yet...Nothing more to do here, for now. Let's take a visit to the neighbouring
village.

Ooo, looks like competition is going on with the inns! The item shop charges
everything at full price, sadly. Items for free time! Check the drawer in the
inn. Receive Cure. Visit the Chief's house and head upstairs to find another
dresser. Receive Herb.

No offence, but I don't like these towns. They hardly give you any tips on 
what to do next. But that's why I'm here, right? Leave town.

Head up and find the path again. Once you do that, follow it, until you reach
a forest. Try to go in, and Ryu will use the Saw to clear the trees blocking
the way. Enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Lament Woods (Forest of Despair)
Party: Ryu, Nina
Items: Herb, T.Drop(x2), Life, Wrist
Enemies: G.Knight, Zombie, Stool, S.Rider

Welcome, to Lament Woods, the Forest of Despair. Lovely titles, no? The place
has a black floor with bones littered about, and a strange gas always fills
the air...

As with the last forest, I hate this one. G.Knights and S.Riders are most 
likely faster then you are right now. But, you can still handle the majority
of battles with a Boomerang and Earth Key combo. Again, navigating is going to
be difficult, but I will try to be as clear as possible.

Follow the path, and you'll hit a north/south intersection. Head south and
follow along. Take the inner path when you get the option, and you'll hit a
chest. Receive Herb. Backtrack to the inner/outer paths, and go on the outer.
Ignore all paths and head straight up to find a chest. Receive T.Drop.

Go south a little, and turn right as soon as you can. Head south and turn 
right again. Continue to go right until you count the second path going down.
Follow that to bring you to two chests. Receive T.Drop and Life. Take the 
road below, and follow it as it goes up. Head north and ignore all paths to
the side to hit another chest. Receive Wrist. Equip onto Nina or Ryu. I'd
personally give it to Ryu, then equip Nina with his old Gauntlet.

Now for the goal. From where the Wrist was, and follow the upper wall of 
forest. You'll see the fortress eventually.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Dark D. Fort
Party: Ryu, Nina
Items: Life(x2), LongSD, T.Drop(x3), Herb(x5), Life2, Acorn, WolfHT
Enemies: S.Rider, Midget, WarHog, Zard

When you enter, two dudes in yellow will block your path. Kill them to pieces.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
Bowman            Lancer
HP: 180           HP: 100

=====================
Boomerang + E.Key multiplied by as many times necessary equals dead. (Killed
them in one turn because Ryu got a slam. Hehe)
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

With them out of the way, walk forward. Whoops, fell for a trap. But hey, 
there's four chests here! Receive two Lifes, LongSD, and T.Drop. Head up the
stairs.

Alright, we know that part is trapped, so let's go around. Take the outer path
and circle around back down to be relatively close to where we started. From
there, take the upper path, as the bottom one is rigged. You'll encounter two
more dudes in yellow.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
Pieces, pieces, make them all into pieces! It's the same enemy type as the 
last forced battle, so do away with these guys in the same manner. After you
pass where they guarded, you'll see a set of stairs going down, but there's
four chests just south of here. Go get them. Receive Herb, T.Drop, Life2, and
Acorn. Nothing else on this floor except a table and some coffee, so let's get
to the lower levels.

Take the set of stairs you see going down to find another basement, with 
another set of four chests. Receive T.Drop, two Herbs, and a WolfHT. Beware,
though, the WolfHT has a Fire trap that causes 50 damage to the person who
opens it. Remember to heal up after getting it. Head upstairs.

Take the lower path (upper one is trapped), and follow the path. You'll find
a chest in a small room. Receive Herb. Keep going along the path until there's
a small passage going down, leading you to the last treasure box. Receive 
Herb. Go north, and you'll see three guys in yellow this time. Have Ryu 
re-equip his LongSD. Now challenge 'em.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
Same battle as before, except there's two lancers instead of one. Not much
of a difference.

Hooray, you saved the chief. He'll ask if you want to take the enemies 
weaponry. You can say no, but he'll say how useful they would be since the
village doesn't have any. He'll ask again. You probably should say yes.

He'll lead you into a trap! And now he'll send his monster to come eat you two
up. Heh, oh well, let's kick it's butt!
(NOTE: You can repeatedly say no to the imposter, and you'll skip the battle
against Pog. I don't recommend it though, Pog gives some nice EXP)
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Pog
HP: 280
AT: 80
EX: 1400
GO: 800
Actions: Attack, Double Attack, Flame Breath, Ice Breath
===================
Any attack Pog uses does 8-11 damage.
Pog's not hard. You might need to recover at the start of the battle because
you just came from legions and legions of battles in a Forest of Despair and
against undead guys, but overall, it isn't that bad. He can attack both Nina
and Ryu in the same turn with his Double Attack, but that probably would have
been more vicious if it hit the same member. Anyway, have Ryu attack, Nina use
the E.Key, and you'll win in no time flat.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Afterwards, the chief shows no intention of letting you go. However, screw his
intentions, because an arrow flies in and flips the switch. You're free! A
ranger named Bo will come in, notifying that the REAL chief has been saved 
thanks to their distraction. The imposter challenges everyone around to a 
fight. He's going to regret that.
 
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
General
HP: 250
AT: 110
EX: 1120
GO: 300
Actions: Attack
===================
He does 16-24 damage.
I wasn't able to see if he had any other abilities, because I owned him in 
two turns. If you forgot to use them, toss your stones at him and watch as his
health bar magically disappear. Chances are that you have used them, so 
resort to physical attacks with Ryu and Bo, and using the E.Key with Nina. You
can alternatively have Bo blast him with his magic, and have someone restore 
his AP afterwards. It really doesn't matter, the General can cause some heavy 
damage, but he dies too dang fast for it to matter.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

He'll cry out that they haven't won completely, as the river is still dry. And
he'll run. The Chief will tell you they were searching for the ring, and that
they should find a way to move the rock. Bo will say that Zog is his enemy,
and he'll ask to join you. New member, get!

Equip the WolfHT onto him, and if you bought it earlier, the ShortBW. And now
the annoying part - You're going to have to walk out of here. Sorry, but you 
gotta if you want to leave this pee-pee soaked heck hole. Make your way back
to Tantar.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Tantar and Tuntar
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: None

Go heal, buy Bo a ShortBW because I'm sure you have to have enough money now,
and most importantly, save. Also sell your old junk. Pay the real chief a 
visit in Tuntar, and he'll point you to Romero. Not there again! I dislike 
their undead folk. But, it seems we have no choice. Let's go.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: Blurb, Stool, Creep, Gloom, Slime, Flea, WarHog, Zombie

Find the path again. Follow it all the way to hit a forest. If you read what
a villager said in Tuntar, you'll know that if Bo is at the front of the party
then you can walk right through the woods. So, select Change in the Menu 
screen and do so. You'll see Romero soon enough.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Romero
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: WtrJar, Herb
Enemies: None

If you entered during the day, talk to everyone. You'll find out that the 
beings raised from the dead have become zombies. I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT WAS BAD!
Why did I come back here? Some other people will also tell you that there's a
WtrJar which can hold a lot of water and how there's Cleansing Water which
might restore the soil. In the top right corner house, the man there will tell
you about Agua if you remove the Zombies. Oh, that's right. Agua. That's why
we're here. Alright, come back to town at night.

AHH!! ZOMBIES! They won't hurt you, but their blue skin creeps me out. Talk
to the old woman in the graveyard. Ryu will ask for the WtrJar, but the lady
won't give it until her husband says a couple of lines. They'll move a grave 
to reveal a secret passage in which you can find the WtrJar. Fall into the 
hole. You'll see two chests. Receive Herb. Obtain WtrJar! Exit through the
only exit.

Oh right, before I forget, shop. Get Bo ChainML. Also, if you didn't get the 
chance earlier, get Ryu ChainML and Nina Gown. Now let's get to that cave.

Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo

Alright, so mister zombie man tipped off us to the west. With Bo in the lead
head west until you see Karma. From there, head down, and you'll see a cave.
Circle around, and enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Ease Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Herb(x3), NiceHT, F.Stn, T.Drop, BronzHT, Apple
Enemies: Mage, Ameblob, G.Knight

Ease Cave? Sounds pretty relaxing, as if there isn't any random encounters.
But damn these misleading names, there are new enemies to square off against.
Ah well.

Let's start by taking the right path, straight to a chest. Receive Herb.
Take the left path this time and follow. You'll hit an inner/outer
choice. Go for the inner and you'll see a chest. Receive Herb. Backtrack, and
take the outer path to find another one. Receive NiceHT. Give it to Nina if
you didn't get her a HairBand, elsewise, don't equip to anyone. Go along the
top, and when you need to choose right or down, go right. Follow the path,
and you'll see a set of stairs. Skip 'em for now, continue along the path, and
one more chest awaits you. Receive F.Stn. Go back to those stairs and take 
them.

Take the lower path, and follow for a chest. Receive Herb. Circle round back 
to the stairs and go north this time. Head off to the right when you can, and
you'll be at a chest. Receive T.Drop. Go back and keep going north, following
the path wherever it may lead. Which happens to be to a set of stairs. Use 
'em.

Go take the higher path, and you'll see stairs going up. Use them to find two
chests. Receive BronzHT and Apple. Equip the BronzHT on Ryu. Return down the
stairs, and take the lower path this time. Take the stairs going down, and
you'll be at a small island on a bunch of water. Use the stairs going down,
and press A. Yay, you got the Cleansing Water! Ryu and gang will automatically
run back to Romero.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Romero
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Herb, Antdt, 900GP, Cure, Tablet
Enemies: None

Ryu will run and sprinkle the water all over town. The place will turn a light
green! And the trees will be alive and healthy! Amazing water. Ryu and company
will then go the man who made the deal about Agua earlier. He'll thank you,
and give you five boxes. Receive Herb, Antdt, 900GP, Cure, and obtain Tablet!
We can get into Agua now.

The people will tell you that there's a boss that guards the key in Agua. Also
the old woman will let you keep the Water Jar, so if you want, go refill it.
Why? Because the cleansing water restores all HP, AP, and ailments (including
"Stun," when a character hits 0HP) for the entire party. Very useful. When
you're done doing anything you want to do, head for Agua.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Agua
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Herb(x2), Life2, Acorn(x2), Apple, SunHT, IronSHl, ThiefCL, HairBand, 
Bracelet, SteelBW
Enemies: S.Rider, G.Knight, WarHog, Zombie

(NOTE - Skipping World Map sections unless they actually have an addition in
enemies or if directions are confusing. Doing this from now on.)

Agua, like someone in Romero said, is north of Romero. You'll need Bo to 
Forest Walk. It's a big flying castle thing. When you enter, walk along the
stone path until you hit it's dead end. Ryu will automatically read the 
inscription, and the castle will float close enough for you to enter. Do so.

Run forward and take the stairs. Circle around and stand on the floaty circle.
It'll carry you to the other side. Run all the way to the left, and you'll see
a chest. Receive Herb. Go back just to the right of the hover plate, and run 
all the way up to see another chest. Receive Life2. You should be able to see
two other chests, which I'm sure you should have the brains to figure out how
to get there. Receive Apple and Acorn. Follow the path and you'll see stairs.
Take them

In here, we have a hover mini-puzzle. Take the first hover circle you see,
and once that drops you off, take the one just left of where you are, for a
chest. Receive SunHT. Equip onto Ryu. Take the only hover available, and 
follow the path to come back to the start point. Again, take the hover, and 
this time run to the bottom of the platform for a choice of left and right.
Take the right hover, and follow the path for another chest. Receive IronSH.
Equip onto Ryu. Take the hover back to the start point. Get back the middle
platform, and use the bottom left hover. Follow the path for the last chest on
this floor. Receive ThiefCL. Equip onto Ryu. (Wow, lotta stuff for Ryu here. 
All we need a weapon.) Take the hover here to reach the stairs, going up to 
the next level.

You'll see a chest immediately once you get up. Receive Acorn. Use the hover,
and you'll be on the middle platform, choices of left and right. Take the left
first, and follow the path, to find a chest. Receive HairBand. Equip onto Nina
if you didn't buy one earlier. Take the hover to fly to another chest. Receive
Herb. Take the hover to get back to the middle platform, and use the right 
side. Follow the path, and what do we have? Another chest. Receive Bracelet.
Equip onto Nina. Take the upper hover, and you'll be on the platform leading
to the next staircase.

Once you crawl out, take the right path. You see those pillars with the blue
lights? Walk into the wall just above the fifth one, and press A. Receive
SteelBW, a nice upgrade for Bo at this point (Thanks to readers for this!).
Anyway, keep following the right path until you find a hover. Use it to
bring you to the middle, with a pillar and a light. (Change Bo's Helm to a 
any other helm in your inventory, it'll work better) Press A against it, and
you'll trigger a battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Wisp
HP: 730
AT: 90
EX: 1200
GO: 300
Actions: Attack, Attack All
Drops: Herb
===================
Any attack Wisp uses does 10-19 special damage (meaning Bo wearing the WolfHT
will take double damage).
Here we go, an actual boss fight where we have more then just attack as an 
option (well there was Pog and General, but those weren't fun). Have Nina use
Atk-Up on Ryu and Bo, then healing and using the E.Key. Fort will be useless
since all of Wisps' attacks deal special damage. Bo cast Fry until he's
out of AP, then start attacking, and Ryu attacking non-stop. Like Pog, Wisp 
can attack all your members, but it won't matter all too much.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

The Wisp will congratulate you, and tell you to search the pillar for the key.
Do so, and the purple light will do a fancy transformation sequence into a key
which Ryu takes possession of. Obtain KngKey! Take the hover circle, and 
prepare to go all the way back down.

Technically, after this point, you can go straight away to the giant robot.
However, I'd suggest taking a pit stop at Romero before heading out, to sell 
and store your items and more importantly, to heal and save.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: The Giant
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Herb, BronzHT, Acorn, Life2, Mrbl1
Enemies: Midget, Blurb

To get here from Romero, just follow the ocean line. Keep following to, up the
ramp, until you see a smaller ramp going down. Head down those, and the robot
should be in sight. Walk down and enter through it's right leg (though, it's
left in your view).

Walk forward, and take the stairs up, and go up the next two flights as well.
Walk to the left, and there will be a room with two chests in plain sight.
Receive Herb and BronzHT. Keep going left, and you'll see the next set of 
stairs.

Walk down a bit, and you'll see the General with his two goons. Walk right in
front of him, and he'll challenge you.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
General + 2 Lancers

Okay, hell, I'm not even going to call this a mini-boss fight, the general and
his lackeys are absolute pushovers. Oh sure, the General has a second wind, 
big deal. I don't even need to tell you what to do. Smash their heads in
is all I ask.

After you win (My god, you better have not taken more then one try) walk up to
the stone thingy and press A. Ryu will jab the key in, and it will get the 
heart functional. The teleport circles will also start to work. Walk to the 
the stairs. There should be to the left of there. Enter it. Skip the first 
teleport you see, and follow the path for another one. Take that one, and take
the first teleport you see here. It'll bring you to a chest. Receive Acorn.
Use the only teleport here which brings ya right back to the start. 

Again, take the one near the stairs, use the second teleport you see, use the
second one again, and take the closer one this time. You'll be brought to two
chests. Receive Life2 and Mrbl1. Take the only teleport you see. This time,
take the second warp, take the only warp, and you'll be brought to where you
want to be. You know, that rectangular prism looks remarkably like the Quake
Control. Run forward and press A to have Ryu jab the key inside. The mind
is now functional. Seeing as how Ryu can't talk, Nina takes charge and 
commands the giant to take them to the lake. After a very lengthy walking
sequence (Capcom got lazy with walking sprites), Nina will tell it to destroy
the rock.
Which, indeed it does, with it's awesome optic beam attack. Cool! The water's
back in the river! Let's go tell the folks in Tantar (Not Tuntar. The chief
made me go through a forest, an enemy fort, an undead village, a cave with a 
misleading name, a fortress, and a stone robot).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Tantar
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Herb, Key
Enemies: None

People here will thank you for bringing the water, so no statues here, either.
Pay the Chief a visit. He'll be so happy with what you did, he'll let YOU have
the Ring that the General was so hungry for. He'll move his throne, revealing
a hole in the ground, and he'll give you light directions. Fall down the hole,
and follow the path to find two chets. Receive Herb and obtain Key! Exit.

Location: Lake Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: W.Ptn
Enemies: None

To get here, head due north of Tuntar, up the ramp, and you'll see your old
stone robot sitting near a cave. Enter.

Follow the path. You need no navigating. There's also a chest in view at some
point. Receive W.Ptn. Exit the cave.

Once you're outside, head northwest, and you'll see another entrance you 
should go into.

Location: Lake Shrine
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo

Enemies: Ameblob, Zard, WarHog, Zombie

There's a creepy thing about this place. Once you go down the flight of stairs
you won't be able to leave until you get the Ring.

Go forward and you'll hit a door. Use that Key the chief gave you, and it will
open. Head down the stairs and down the next ones. Follow the path and hey, a
flight of stairs going up. Use them, and go down the waterfall. Follow the
stream, and skip the stairs going down. You should see a chest, which I'm sure
you have the brains to reach. Receive Life. Keep going along the only choice
you have, and you'll see stairs. Skip 'em for now, because there's a chest 
beyond that. Receive Life2. Now head down the stairs.

Follow the path, and you'll see another set of stairs. That was easy. Head
up all the stairs, and head north when you can for a treasure chest. Receive
2000GP. Head down the stairs into the water, and follow the path. There will
be some stairs that leads onto a platform with a chest. Receive Herb. Now
use the stairs that lead onto the larger platform, and head all the way south.
A bit to the left of there is a chest. Receive Acorn. Backtrack a bit, and 
take the left as soon as you can. Follow the path, going down the stairs and
down the waterfall, and continue following. Use the first set of stairs you 
see and head up all the ramps for a chest. Receive SkySH. Equip onto Nina.
Go back down, and keep following the stream to another platform, with some 
pillars around a blue chest. Receive Ring! Equip onto Ryu, and use the warp to
return to the entrance. Exit the shrine, and get your butt over to Tantar.

Location: Tantar
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: None

(TRIVIAL - Tuntar is empty right now, so no Item Shop or Storage)

When you enter, you'll be greeted by two forest clan members. They'll move 
aside to let you pass. Heal and save, sell your old junk, and make your way to
the chief's house. Talk to the Tuntar Chief to trigger the wedding. (Shortest
wedding lines, ever). When you're done, leave the house, and the village.

Oh, crap, shoulda seen that coming. The General has taken control over the 
robot whilst you were at the wedding. The Robot then uses it's optic beam 
power to blast Tuntar to smithereens. Good thing no one was there, huh? But 
the General makes the next order to destroy Tantar. The Robot refuses to move
however. Now is your chance, kick the Generals' butt! Enter the Giant.

Enemies: Blurb, Midget

Quickly make your way back to the brain of the Robot. If you don't remember 
how to, follow the path, going up all the stairs until you see a warp to the
left. Take it. Just take the second warp you see, and you'll find reach the
brain. Before you challenge the General again, change Bo's Helm. Now, let's 
kick this guy's butt once and for all!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Gremlin
HP: 1200
AT: 140
EX: 1400
GO: 800
Actions: Attack, Attack All
===================
Any attack Gremlin uses does 15-30 damage.
Whoo, just got a load tougher then his previous wussy form. Alright, like the
Wisp, he deals special damage, so Bo will take massive damage if you had his
WolfHT on. Nina should Atk-up Ryu as soon as possible. Ryu should be attacking
continously. Bo should be casting Fry non-stop, and Nina should be healing 
Bo's AP with Acorns and healing the party. If she has a free turn, she should
attack with any stones you may have left and the E.Key. Keep in mind that the
Gremlin is faster than all your characters, so heal ahead of time. If you mess
up, you can still restore a single person's health with Nina's magic, since 
that will always go first. Once he's on his second wind, he will ALWAYS use
attack all, so I highly recommend bringing a supply of meats.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After you win, the General refuses to give up. He'll try and control the
robot, but it still doesn't listen. The General will explode. The Robot will
then move on it's own. The party will escape as it reaches the volcano south
of where Tuntar used to be.

My god! Ryu said another word, completely consciously! Insane. Anyway, the 
robot jumps into the volcano to commit suicide. The volcano erupts, and the
lava somehow manages to only get into the river. The water cools it down very
quickly, hardening it into rock. You can now get to the other side.

This chapter has come to an end, let's get onto...

(TRIVIAL - The overworld music changed.)

Just south of the igneous rock pile, you should spot a shrine. Enter it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Dragon Shrine
Party: Ryu
Items: Melon
Enemies: None

Go into the shrine, and run forward. Talk with the man here, and he'll say
you need proper training to break the seal. He'll send Ryu in alone. There's
a healing spring to the left and a chest to the right. Receive Melon. Head 
into the middle and you'll see the Dragon Lord. Talk to him, and you'll 
trigger a battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Talon
HP: 700
AT: 70
EX: 400
GO: 190
Actions: Attack
==================
Talon does 9-15 damage. It can cause a slam.
As Ryu, you're out of options again. So, let's attack and heal when necessary.
Heal at about 30HP, and attack with the E.Key.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

The Dragon Lord will congratulate you, and send sparkles to fly into Ryu. The
screen will glow gold for a moment, and then die back down. He'll ask you to
use your powers to restore peace. You learned the Drake Spells! Heal, and 
exit the shrine.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Fairy Woods
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: None

A bit south of the Dragon Shrine, you'll find some patches of flowers. The one
in the middle of the forest will have some fairies, which you should talk to,
and there's another with the flower patches arranged in a circle. Step into 
the middle, and you can talk to a man there. Once that's done, head for Cape
Cave.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Cape Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: Fly, Shadow, Midget

South of Fairy Woods, there's an entrance to a cave. Enter.

There's no items here, so you're only goal is the exit. Follow the path until
you hit an intersection, with choices of left or down. Go down, as the left
path will eventually be blocked. You'll be out of here in no time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Auria
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: PrisnCL, Life2, Life(x3), S.Ptn, Cure(x3), W.Ant, V.Ptn, 2000GP(x2), 
Mrbl1, L.Ptn, Mrbl3, Acorn, SmartRG, Antdt, G.Tiara, 5000GP, 20000GP
Enemies: None

South of Cape Cave, you'll see a town. Enter it and be amazed at their 
all-gold city. Unfortunately, right when you walk up, you'll be arrested (What
the hell? Idiot guards).

Search the fountain thing in the top-right corner. Receive PrisnCL. Talk to 
the guy in bed. He'll ask if you want him to help you. Say yes, and he'll pick
the lock with ease. He'll return to sleep right after. Well, let's take it.
Go up stairs and exit this building. (One of the guards is running around for
no reason. They won't see you leave either, and if you didn't notice, they 
didn't disarm you. They ARE idiots.)

Because the guards are so protective (IDIOTS!), you'll need to avoid them like
you did the guards in Nanai. If you get caught, just talk to the guy in the
bed again, and he'll let you go.

First things first, save.  Now, let's check out their shops. Right beside the
police headquarters.

=====
Shops
=====
Inn: 200G

ITEMS            EQUIPMENT
Herb   -    13G  Rapier  - 1650G
Worm   -    65G  Dagger  - 2200G
Life   -   650G  LongSD  - 2750G
Vitamn -   650G  LongBW  - 2860G
Mrbl1  -  1300G  BroadSD - 5500G
Pouch  -  1300G  Tiara   - 1650G
Rod1   -  1300G  SunHT   - 2750G
G.Bar  - 65000G  SageML  - 3300G

WAH! The guards say you're trying to rob Auria. I say Auria's trying to rob 
ME! What the heck is up with that Inn Price? Whatever, get Nina a Rapier and
Tiara and Bo a SageML. The same weapons will appear later, but for a cheaper
price. Also, buy a Vitamn, Pouch. The Vitamn and Pouch you'll need soon (or 
more of, want). Head upstairs, and talk to the man at the table, who will ask 
you to bring some vitamins (you only need one though). Do so, and he'll give 
you 5000GP. That's a nice profit.

You'll also see a drawer, attempting to hide a hole behind it. Push it aside,
and walk in. You'll see a secret home here. If you talk to the man, he'll tell
you about a society of thieves will mysterious powers, who were wiped out by
the Dark Dragons. Also, if you move the pot in the room, and search the floor
there, you'll receive Life2. Nothing more here, so leave the shop.

Now to rob the residents! Behind the police headquarters contains four 
mansions. Let's start with the lower-left. Heh, the people here are actually
afraid of people entering their houses. But that's why they should get a LOCK.
In the top left corner is a chest. Receive Life. Across from there is a 
drawer. Receive S.Ptn. Head upstairs, and there will be another drawer to the
right. Receive Cure. In the bedroom lies a chest. Receive W.Ant. Exit this
mansion. Next house, the lower-right. 

There's a chest and a drawer in the same places as the other house. Receive
Life and V.Ptn. Head upstairs. Again, there's a drawer and a chest in the same
places as the last house. Receive 2000GP and Mrbl1. Next on our to-raid list,
the upper-right.

All in the same spots...HOWEVER! The chest on the first floor is rigged. So
don't touch it. Get to the drawer. Receive L.Ptn. Head upstairs. Nothing here
is rigged, so take from both the chest and drawer. Receive Mrbl3 and Cure.
Don't leave just yet, talk to the old man on the second floor with Nina in
front. After a small scene of glowing pink, you receive 20000GP! Cool!

Here we go, the upper-left house. Same spots, take from the chest and drawer.
Receive Acorn and SmartRG. Equip onto Nina. Head upstairs, and again, take
from the drawer and chest. Receive Life and Antdt. Talk to the woman on the 
first floor. If you listened to me earlier and talked to the man and fairies
at Fairy Woods, you'll progress in a little side-quest. If you didn't, you're
going to have to make one more trip then you needed to. In any case, we can't
do any more here, so let's raid the last mansion.

It's at the top of the residential area. Head up the stairs as soon as you can
and make your way to the left. Go up from here, and you'll see a bare room 
with two chests. Receive Cure and G.Tiara. Now go to the top-right of the 
floor to find a drawer. Receive 2000GP.

Well, that's all the precious items we can steal here. Let's make little 
progress with a main quest. Run to the left of the shops, and you'll see a man
with a ship. Talk to him. Run back the the biggest mansion, and talk with 
Ross. Agree to help him. (How the heck did he get his daughter locked in a 
safe?) Also, sell the G.Tiara, it's too weak to be any good, though it fetches
quite a price. Now, let's help that lady we met earlier get her son back. Get
back to Fairy Woods. You can either go through Cape Cave again, or have Nina
cast Warp to Tantar and walk from there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Fairy Woods
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: None

Talk the fairies here. Agree to convince the guy from cutting down trees. Go 
back to where the guy is running around in circles. Talk to the fairies, then
the guy. Why did they need you? The fairies convinced him fine themselves.
Anyway, get back to Auria, through Cape Cave or warp.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Auria
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: 20000GP
Enemies: None

Go back to the old lady's house. She'll give you some money. Receive 20000GP.
Hm, she said this wasn't much. Lousy rich folk, always showing off their 
stuff. But eh, might as well take it then.

You know what's REALLY crappy at this point, though? The fact that you'll need
to give up 65000GP, that's what. You'll need to buy a G.Bar, because it's 
required to complete the next part. You should have enough money after all 
that finding, but if you don't, sell some old stuff and kill some more 
monsters. When you can, buy the G.Bar. Sob, I'm sorry money.

Well, all that can be done in Auria has been done, so, let's go to the next
place.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: L & D Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: ShellHT, Cure
Enemies: Midget, Bully

To the east of Auria is a cave. Enter it, and talk to the people guarding the
entrance. They'll tell you to be on guard when you enter Bleak, because it's
full of thieves. Head down the stairs.

Like the early caves, you only have one choice to go with. So, follow the 
path. You'll see a path to the right, but don't go there, because it's 
blocked. Keep following, and skip the thin path to the left. Keep going...and
once you see it, take the wide left path. Take the two chests. Receive ShellHT
and Cure. The ShellHT rocks, but no one in your party can equip it right now,
so it's just a teaser. Lame.

Go back, and return to following path. Head south when you have a choice. The
exit is very close.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: G.Slime, Fly, Mage, G.Knight

This place is basically the opposite of Auria. Auria is always in day, and 
this is always in night. The enemies here are definitely worth spending some
time on. You'll be amazed at how fast your EXP and GP will rise as you fight
here. However, they also hurt pretty bad, so you should familiarize yourself
with the town nearby before you go off training. Just follow the strip of land
as it circles the lake. You'll see it soon enough.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Bleak
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: 5000GP, Herb(x4), Life2, Life, W.Ant, Icicle
Enemies: None (Unless you count the thieves trying to steal from you)

As always, save at the shrine before doing anything. Now, talk to some people,
who will happily admit that they are thieves. Well, at least it isn't the 
classic "I'm a TREASURE HUNTER, not a thief!" Anyway, let's heal up at the Inn
as well. The man there will say he's giving free admission. If you don't have
the Pouch item in your inventory, he'll steal 200GP from you when you sleep.
If you DID buy it, like I told you to, then a little scene will occur, where
Ryu catches him before he manages to take anything. He'll apologize, and fork
over 5000GP. Knowing him, I bet it's counterfeit, but the shops won't know the
difference. You won't be healed when that happens, so rest again. He'll give
free lodging from now on, so you can do away with your pouch.

Speaking of shops, let's see what Bleak has for sale.

=====
Shops
=====
Inn: Free (200GP if you didn't trigger cutscene)

ITEMS           EQUIPMENT
Mrbl3  -   12G  Dagger  - 2000G
Herb   -   12G  LongBW  - 2600G
Antdt  -   18G  BroadSD - 5000G
T.Drop -   24G  MetalSH - 1400G
Acron  -   36G  HuntCL  - 1500G
Charm  -  180G  IronSL  - 2000G
Life   -  600G  BronzAR - 3600G
Cure   - 2400G  WoolRB  - 5000G

High prices in the items, cheaper the Auria in the Equipment. Eh, I never 
really bought anything from items anyway. Get Bo a LongBW, Ryu a BroadSD and
MetalSH, and Nina a WoolRB.

So, these guys like to steal, huh? Well, let's give them a taste of their own
medicine. Just east of the item shop is a house with a bogus fortune teller
outside. Enter, and walk to the left. Push the barrel and search the ground 
there. Receive Life2.

In the house behind the shops, is a bogus magician. However, we're not here
for him (actually, if you want, you can see a cameo of Chun-Li). Head upstairs
and walk on the lower path, to find two chests. Receive two Herbs. Exit, and
go to the house to the right of this one. Go on the second floor, and find
two chests exactly where the last two were in the other house. Receive two 
Herbs.

Head into the top house, and go upstairs. Again, there are two chests, right 
on spot. Receive Life and W.Ant. Go back downstairs, and have a chat with the
old man. You'll fork over your precious G.Bar, but you'll obtain Icicle! A
requirement for progression. All is done in Bleak. Leave the city.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Desert Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: Midget
(There's probably more, I'll update this later)

The desert cave is just a bit west of Bleak. You'll see the cave entrance 
eventually.

There isn't much to say about the Desert Cave, actually. Just follow the path
and you'll be out. Heck, there isn't even any treasure here that will make 
your journey through any longer.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: None
Enemies: Prickle, Creeon, Scorp, SandClod, Cactus, Mage, G.Knight, G.Slime

A slew of new opponents who can cause some pretty good hurt on your 
characters if you didn't train. Also, lemme tell you, it's difficult to find 
Arad in the middle of the desert. When you don't have a guide, that is. Head 
south once you exit the cave, but stop when the mountains end. Head to the 
right, and when the range begins to retreat upward, start walking down. You'll
run into the wall of the city.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Arad
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo
Items: Fife
Enemies: Sandworm

I love the people of Arad. I love them so very much. Look at their design for 
crying out loud! There are no shops or items to be found, but you can sleep
for free (no joke) in their Inn. Rest and save, then make your way to the 
big red tent at the top of the town. Talk to the old man, and agree to help
him for the fife. It'll automatically change to night time, so walk outside 
and head into the little seperate section at the top-right of the village.
You'll see a little bit of ground going crazy, so walk to up and trigger a 
boss battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
SandWorm
HP: 1600
AT: 180
EX: 1200
GO: 1200
Actions: Attack
===================
Sandworm attacks for 15-25 special damage.
Again, if Bo has his WolfHT on, he'll take quite a bit of damage. However, 
this fight is over really quickly, so I don't think you'll need to switch it 
out. Have Ryu use ThrDr and attack non-stop, Nina Atk-Up herself and Bo, then
attack, and have Bo attack non-stop. Seriously, if Nina can do 50+ on this guy
with an Atk-Up, how tough can he be? (My Nina was kickin' butt with continuous
slam attacks, going upwards to 130+) Heck, you might even consider Atk-Up on 
Ryu and have him attack regularly. SandWorm's defense is THAT pathetic. He'll 
be down and out before you know it.
(NOTE: SNES Version, SandWorm is weak to ice, so use SnoDr and Frost, if 
you're playing that version.)
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Ryu will strike a pose at the victory, and the Chief will let you have the 
Fife. So, run to the chest and take it. Obtain Fife! With this, we can enter
Krypt! Let's go there now.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Krypt
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, +Karn
Items: IcyHT, SkullHT(x2), Cure, Antdt, HeadGear, Dagger, IronSH, Herb(x3), 
Life(x2), HuntCL
Enemies: Scorp, Mage, E.Chest, Fly, Midget, G.Slime

From Arad, head due south, and you'll see the Krypt with a bunch of whirlpools
around it, and a stone plate. Stand on the stone plate and press A to create a
bridge. Walk inside.

Since the easy way is blocked off, you gotta go the long way round to the 
stairs. Head down them.

Personally, I'd recommend skipping all the treasure here because there are 
A LOT of traps. You'll get them later, but right now, it's going to murderlize
you. Instead, head to the south-east to find another set going down. Head 
north when you can, and skip past the B.Rang in the rock and the chest. 
Eventually, you'll confront a monster.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
EyeSpy
HP: 1600
AT: 100
EX: 2800
GO: 2800
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 25)
===================
EyeSpy deals 9-15 damage.
Not hard at all, Ryu should ThrDr and attack, Bo should attack and use Fry
occasionally, and Nina should Atk-Up Bo and use the E.Key. When it's on it's
second wind, it will use nothing but T.Bolt, but at that point, you can wipe 
it out in one turn with ThrDr attack, Bo's Fry spell, and the E.Key.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Once you own it, it'll cry out that you're only human and shouldn't be this
powerful. Uhm, take another look pal. I've got a Dragon-Boy, a girl with wings
and a veteran war-wolf. And I thought more eyes let you see better. Head down
stairs, and you'll see a bunch of chests. Take 'em all but the blue one. 
Receive IcyHT, Cure, two SkullHT, and Antdt. Now open the blue chest. Trapped!
But it isn't the Boom or Fire or Sproing or whatever, this one will drown you.
Luckily, Karn saves you (hey, it's the guy from Auria) and diss you pretty 
badly. But anyway, your group will convince him to join. Follow him downstairs
and he'll join you. New member, get!

Karn is an expert thief, meaning he can disarm any traps, and open any door
that may be locked. However, right now, he sucks at fighting. Whatever, let's
head back upstairs and get those chests we missed.

Back up to where you fought EyeSpy, there's a chest across the B.Rang in the 
rock. Receive HeadGear. Head upstairs to the floor that was huge. Alright,
prepare for my bad descriptions. Let's start at the bottom right of the floor.
There's a chest around there. Receive Dagger. Head north from there and hit
the top of the floor. You'll see a chest. Receive IronSH. Head to the left 
from there, and another chest lies here. Receive Herb. Continue to the left
for another chest. Receive DreamRG. Head south from there, and one last chest
lays on the platform. Receive Life.

Now, head all the way back down to right after the flooding thing. Open up all
the gates, and proceed to following the path. Once you see a gate, skip it for
now, and head to the left to find two chests. Receive Life and Herb. Go back
to the locked door, and open it. Head down the stairs, follow the path, go up
the stairs and head south. Again, follow the path, and you'll find a chest.
Receive HuntCL. Backtrack the stairs, and take the one on the platform.

Going down all the stairs will bring you to a giant room, with caskets 
circling the stairs. Open all of them. On the last one, you'll find out that
the casket IS the book! It won't teach anything, either, because if you got 
this far, you're a master already. Karn gains confidence. Let's free the girl
in the safe now. You're going to have to walk out. Bleh.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Auria
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: None
Enemies: None

Head to rich man Ross's house and go to the basement. With Karn in the lead,
open up all the locked doors. The girl doesn't thank you, but instead tells 
you about the LtKey. Her father plans to give it to the Dark Dragons, and that
if her mother were still alive, then she would have told him to do the right
thing. Pieces of the puzzle come together, showing what you'll need to do 
next. Pah. Let's raid all the treasure we missed earlier because of locked 
doors first.
(NOTE: If you want, you can stop by Camlon to find out what the statue is.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Winlan
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: Cure, Life, Life2, FlameRP, Turban, BrokenSD
Enemies: None

If you recall, Winlan's basement that leads toward the bridge had a locked 
door with a bunch of chests behind it. There's six in total. Receive Cure, 
Life2, Life, FlameRP, Turban, and BrokenSD. Next stop, Agua! Warp to Romero.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Agua
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: LavaSH, LifeAR, IcyDR
Enemies: S.Rider, G.Knight, WarHog, Zombie

I'll assume you remember how to get to Agua from Romero. With Karn in the lead
you'll easily get up the tower much quicker then you did before. Just open the
locked doors, and the next set of stairs should be in sight. Once you get to
the floor where you fought with the Wisp, head to the left. Another locked 
door, which Karn will make quick work of. Ride the hover to the the other side
and head outside. Follow the path back inside for a chest. Receive LavaSH.
Equip onto Ryu or Karn. Head to the left, skipping the hover, to find a set of
stairs. Going up them will lead you to the true top of the fortress. You 
should see two dragon statues. Search in front of them for two godly pieces 
of equipment. Receive LifeAR and IcyDR. LifeAR is the best armour for Ryu, and
IcyDR is the second best weapon for Karn (The best one you'll only get if 
you're really lucky.) Equip on their respective persons. There isn't much else
to do here. You can look inside the shrine for a foresight on an event that is
to come much later. 

Let's get back to the L&D Cave too, whilst we're revisiting places.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: L & D Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: Dart, G.Bar
Enemies: Bully, Fly, Midget

There was a locked door here on the second floor somewhere. It only has a 
single chest behind it. Receive Dart. Would have been good if you didn't 
already get the IcyDR. There's also a locked door north of the exit to Bleak.
It also only has one chest. Receive G.Bar. Hang onto this.

Now, what was it we had to do again? Oh yeah. Get Ross to talk to his dead 
wife. If you remember, some people in Bleak said that there was a mirror which
could let you talk to the afterlife. So, let's head back to Bleak.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: L.D Tower
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: 2000G(x2), B.Stn, Life, Life2, Herb, Cure, HornHT, Turban, DkKey, 
Mirror
Enemies: Shadow, Fungus, Chopper

Strange, the people at Bleak called it L.Keep. Anyway, to get here, just go 
around the lake at Bleak, and you'll see a tower. Walk up and open the locked
door. There's a chest real close by. Receive 2000G. Go up the stairs. Follow
the lower path, and you'll see an old man. Talk to him, and he'll see if 
you're the legendary hero. He'll move back to let you pass, but he'll block 
the path to a treasure chest. Ah well. Go up the stairs. Take the left set of
stairs, to find two chests. Receive B.Stn and Life. Go back down, and take
the right set this time. Go north, and up the stairs right in front of you.
A chest lies here. Receive Life2. Go down the left set of stairs, and 3 chests
will await you. Receive Herb, Cure, and HornHT. Equip onto any of the males.
Go back up the stairs, and down the right set. Skip the stairs going down,
and go south, to the right, and north to find stairs going up. Circle around
this floor, and skip the first set of stairs, and take the second flight you
see. Go up the next set, and you'll find yourself at a chest. Receive Turban.
Follow the lower path, and you'll find one last chest. Receive 2000G.

Go down the two sets of stairs, and take the left set. Go up the next set of
stairs as well, and you'll find yourself at a pillar and a ball of light. Talk
to it, and you'll trigger a battle. Here we go again.

! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Cloud
HP: 1400
AT: 120
EX: 4800 
GO: 1200
Actions: T.Bolt(40), Burn Out(40), Devistate(All, 45)
Drops: Herb
===================
Whoo, another no-regular-attacker. Have Nina keep everyone's health above 45,
Atk-Up Bo and Karn, and use the E.Key. Have Ryu use ThrDr and attack non-stop,
Bo Fry until he's out of AP and resort to regular attacks, and Karn attack 
non-stop, since that's all he can do. Cloud will be gone soon enough.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
After that, the Cloud will give you the DkKey. He says to find the LtKey to 
complete the pair. Obtain DkKey! With this, you can turn wherever you are to
night time! Alright, that's a sucky ability, but hey, think of it this way: if
it was in real life, it would rock like crazy with your burglary-ness. The 
tower will also light up considerably. 

As you walk down, remember to talk to the old man before you leave. He'll let
you take his treasure now that you proved yourself. Obtain Mirror! With this,
we can get old man Ross to be a smart person. Let's do that now. We'll also 
need to force him to give up the LtKey to us so everywhere won't be constantly
day.

(Trivial - If you head into Bleak, the scammers will be gone or stop 
scamming.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Auria
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Karn
Items: Herb(x5), Dart, MetalSH, B.Stn, F.Stn, LtKey, GnPwdr
Enemies: None

Head to rich man Ross's house. Go to their dining room and talk to Ross. 
You'll trigger a small cutscene. Ross hardly needed any convincing. (She says
"Peace!" when she leaves. Blah.) Anyway, after that, head back into the safe 
and talk to their daughter. She'll let you pass if you agree to smack the Dark
Dragons coming for the key. Raid the chests! Receive five Herbs, Dart, 
MetalSH, and B.Stn. Head up the stairs continuously, and you'll see a room 
with a chest. Take it! Receive F.Stn. Go up the last set, and...

WOAH! MINE EYES! The place is very, very bright. Let's take the key on the 
pillar. Walk up to it, and press A. Obtain LtKey! As Bleak brightened up when 
you took the DkKey, this place will darken when you take the LtKey. With this,
you can change the time of anywhere into day.

Alright, with that taken care of, let's get that ship and sail to Scande. 
Unfortunately, the D.Dragons are there. Beat 'em up!

Easily beaten. You don't even need Ryu to use any of his Drake spells.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
Now that they were killed, they'll be pissed and blow up Ross's ship. Then 
they'll run. You'll need to use the North Peninsula to get to someplace or
another, I dunno, I wasn't paying attention. But whatever happens, you'll need
to trade your G.Bar for GnPwdr. Good thing we found one in the L&D Cave huh?
Agree. Obtain GnPwdr! Let's head back into Cape Cave and blast those rocks!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Squid
HP: 1000
AT: 155
EX: 6000
GO: 4200
Actions: Charge, GlobShot, Attack All
===================
Any of his globshot attacks does about 15-50 damage. However, Ryu will take 
considerably less damage because of the super equipment you found in Agua.
This includes damage from his Charge attack. It did 105 to my Bo, but when he
used it on Ryu, it did a measly 11. Used it on Nina, and it caused 28. So, I 
can't really pinpoint the ranges.
Being a water creature, electrical attacks should do very nice damage. Ryu 
should cast ThrDr and attack, Nina should Atk-Up herself and Karn, then resort
to regular attacks, Bo should cast Fry, and Karn should attack. Squid will 
fall before it can do any real damage.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

He'll explode. Time to raid the goodies. Go to the drawer and check it. 
Receive V.Ptn. Go downstairs. Four chests await you. Receive two Acorns and 
two Herbs. Nothing more here, so let's get back to Auria.

Talk to the Captain. You'll trigger a cutscene. By stealing the Dark D. Ship,
you can head for Scande now. The fish merchant that stole our G.Bar will 
decide to tag along. Unfortunately, three ships will intervene. The fish dude
will say to detonate the gun powder on the ship and make a run for it. Nina'll
point out that they're going to get killed if they try that. The fish merchant
whose name is Gobi, will say that going down isn't a big deal to him. The 
General will get smart and command his lackeys to fight you.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
2 Archers and a SpearMan.
Kill 'em.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

(Where did the General and Captain go?)
Gobi'll take charge and lead the party inside. Too bad that the General comes
back with more lackeys.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
3 Archers.
Oh no, what ever will we do?
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After that fight, Gobi somehow managed to teleport your party through the 
walls. He'll lead you to the floor below the chests. The General comes back
with two more idiots.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
2 Archers.
If you beat the fight before, I don't see why you need help with this one.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Right after that, the General transforms.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Octo
HP: 1000
AT: 160
EX: 6000
GO: 1500
Actions: Charge, GlobShot
===================
He's so alike with his brother, in the fact that his attacks are only a tiny
bit stronger (If at all), and he's a wuss when it comes to lightning attacks.
He will, however, use his charge attack much more often then his brother did,
so beware.
Anyway, same strategy as before. Ryu use ThrDr and attack like mad, Nina use
Atk-Up on Karn and herself and attack like mad, Bo cast Fry like a mad man, 
and Karn, well, attack like mad. He'll be dead in practically the same time
it took to kill his brother.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

The General refuses to let you live, so he explodes and sets fire to the gun
powder. Gobi and Karn will leave their first chance, and the rest will quickly
follow. Everybody makes a dive for it. Boom goes your ship. Wow goes Gobi. 
Boom goes the other ships. Smart move, mister General, blow up more then you
had to.

The resulting explosion causes a wild torrent in the water, wiping out our 
heroes. What goes on next? It's time for...

Location: World Map
Party: Gobi

(TRIVIAL - Battle Theme changes.)

The party will find themselves on an island. Gobi says you'll need to travel
underwater, so he'll sell you some gills in order to do so. However, he'll 
charge an unrealistic 1,000,000GP for it. You have no choice but to accept.
He'll notice you don't have enough cash, and he'll ask you if you want to pay
him all you have now and loan him the rest. Again, no choice but to agree, the
dirty rat. As he doesn't have the Gills with him now, he'll go out to get 
them (Smart move Ryu, the guy can run away with your money!). You'll take 
control of Gobi now. Head down the beach and into the water.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Underwater Map
Party: Gobi
Items: None
Enemies: Fishy, CreonX, CactusX, CrawlerX, DogFish

Run from all possible encounters. Gobi sucks and can barely take a single 
battle. He has terrible damage outputs, so if you still want to fight, use
the E.Key or EbbX. If you're afraid of running into a battle, use a Mrbl3 if
you have one.

It's a pretty short walk to Prima. Just head west and you'll see it in sight.

SAVE! Go to the shrine and save (How the heck did they get fire underwater,
anyway?). Now, you can wander around and talk to the residents of Prima.
Prima is a place with a ton of shops. You'll find lots and lots of shops with
various items at various prices. And of course, that means an a**load of work
for me.

Okay, OW! I hate doing Prima's stuffs because I need to give all the coverage
in the items and equipments sections. And that really, really sucks.
 
Also, with all these items, don't just buy the first thing you see. Be careful
with your moneys, because you could end up buying something and finding it 
cheaper somewhere else, or another equipment piece that's more powerful. When
you're done shopping (I personally didn't buy anything, I don't like using
Gobi) head into the the tallest building with the red manillo head on it.
Talk to the blue manillo. He'll say that they don't have any Gills right now,
and you should go to Gant to get them. Lousy...No choice. Let's go.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gant
Party: Gobi
Items: HrGlas, L.Ptn, A.Ptn, Goods
Enemies: None

Alright, to get to Gant from Prima, head south from the town until you hit
the south wall. There should be a slope upward to the right of there. Head up
there, and follow the path through the mountains. Gant will be beyond a small
forest of dead trees.

Things to raid, things to raid. The left-most house at the bottom of the town
has a drawer. Receive HrGlas. This item is pretty pointless, since we can have
the same effect by using the Light and Dark Keys. On the second level of the
town, there's a house on the right that has a drawer. Receive L.Ptn. Head into
the top most house, that also happens to be the largest. Head upstairs to find
a drawer. Receive A.Ptn.

And here are the shops.

Yay for Camlon prices in the Item Shop.

Information hunting will be much shorter since there's hardly anyone here. The
only people that are here other then the business managers is the clan leader
and an old lady. The clan leader will inform you that they got attacked and 
their men were kidnapped. Then he'll ask you to deliver goods (uhm? script 
needs work). Agree to do so. If you talk to him again, he'll tell you why the
men were taken and where they're being held. We can't worry about that yet, so
go up to the chest and take the chest. Obtain Goods. Get back to Prima.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Prima
Party: Gobi
Items: Gills
Enemies: None

Once you're back here, head to the guild leader. He'll reward you delivering
the Goods with the Gills. Obtain Gills! (WHAT A LIAR! "I don't have the Gills"
Bull****.) He'll also read a letter attached to it, saying that Gant has been
attacked. Then some noise goes on, and two manillos come in to report that 
the Dark Dragons smashed a Gant boat, and there's a survivor that needs the 
leaders help. Gobi, being curious, decides to follow.

A grim reaper stands before the survivor, ready to whisk him away into the
land of the dead. The guild leader says that the Iron Ogre Clansmen is too
important to lose. Gobi will say that he's got a warrior ready to force the
Grim Reaper away, and charge Mr. Manillo Leader. Refuse his offer twice for
more money. It won't go any higher then 6000G. 

Alright, let's go get Ryu and gang! (Wait a second...how is that Ox still
living underwater? Musta gotten a pair of gills for him.)

Party: Ryu, Nina, Gobi, Karn

I'm sure you remember how to get back to the island. If not, head east from
Prima and up the shore. Talk with Ryu, and everyone will be in your party. You
now get to choose an active party, but you can switch to your unused character
at any point in battle. Gobi does more damage then Bo if you got a HeroSP from
Gant, and he does need some levels, so I'd switch him out. Bo gains levels 
real quick anyway.

Okay then, if you want, go burn a hole in your money pouch. You can re-equip
your characters with A LOT of stuff. Also, you might or might not noticed, but
the wounds you had from the fight at the ship still remain, so heal. Also, 
save. When all is done, head into the more expensive inn and go upstairs.
Go beat up that grim reaper wannabe.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Morteo
HP: 1500
AT: 180
EX: 3200
GO: 3000
Actions: Attack
===================
He does 34-45 damage, except to Ryu if he is wearing LifeAR
Pathetic. I can't believe I decided to call this a boss fight, but I dunno,
calling him a mini-boss doesn't seem right. Anyway, this cousin of Morte and
Mortea is a wimp. You can really just AUTO the fight, and stop it if someone's
health starts to get low. Heck, Nina will do more the then E.Key when she 
isn't even powered up (though that may be because I bought an EvilRP for her).
If you want, power-up your characters with Atk-Ups to speed up the fight. 
Morteo has a weakness to fire, but you can't really exploit that if Ryu 
powered-up is doing past 172 damage.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Morteo will disappear, leaving our Iron Ogre here alive. Okay, if you can kill
off the grim reaper like that every time someone is dying, then that is super
power which deserves to be abused. Anyway, Ox will tell you that his clansmen
have been captured. Yeah, we already knew that, remember? I can't believe he
was going to die to tell us that. Peh. Our team, being the good people they 
are, decide to pitch in and help out. Gobi sees this as his opportunity to get
his license back. Ox will be happy, and join your party. Member get! (Oh shoot
he screwed up my chapter titles. Two members in one chapter can't be worked
with!)

Ox's strength will let you break a bunch of rocks and weak walls. So, let's 
backtrack and treasure hunt! BUT FIRST! We should get a spell for Karn, which
will make him very useful. Get to Gant.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gant
Party: Ryu, Nina, Gobi, Ox
Items: None
Enemies: None

Go to the clan leader's house, and to where you found the chest with goods.
There should be a moveable drawer to the right, trying to cover a hole. Push 
it aside and enter. Have Ox break the rocks, and then have Karn talk to the
man behind it. He'll teach Karn the Shin simultation spell! Awesome! Use it
to fuse together Bo, Gobi, and Karn to create Shin, who will now be your most
powerful member. Also, if you didn't burn as big of a hole as I did in your
wallet, go get Ox-ey a SpineHR and MetalAR.

Alright, let's get to those goodies we missed. To Agua! Warp to Romero, if you
didn't figure out that that's the closest you could get to there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Agua
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: SilverBR, Life2, 3000GP, Life
Enemies: The one you fought last time.

Summon the fortress, head inside, go up the stairs, take the hover, and walk
to the right. With Ox in the lead, press A against the wall that looks 
different, and he'll smash it down. Pick up the four chests. Receive SilverBR,
Life2, 3000GP, and Life. Leave Agua, and let's go to the L&D Cave at Auria.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: L&D Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: L.Ptn, A.Ptn
Enemies: The ones you fought last time.

Alright, once you enter, head down the stairs, through the used-to-be locked
gate, up the next set of stairs, and follow the path upwards to around where
Karn got us that G.Bar. Beside that room with the now-empty-chest is a room
with two chests behind a crumbly wall. You should know what to do. Receive
L.Ptn and A.Ptn. To the Krypt near Arad!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Krypt
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: B.Rang
Enemies: Gee, I dunno, what did you need to kill before?

Head down to the third level where you fought with EyeSpy. There was a rock
with a Boomerang stuck onto it. Have Ox smash the rock, and the B.Rang will be
floating oh so magically infront of you. Take it. Receive B.Rang! You can't 
use it yet, but it's less of a hassle to get it now. Alright, back to the main
quest. Get to Prima first.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Underwater
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox

Enemies: M.Scorp, R.Slime, Chimera

From the shore, head south and follow through the mountain range. Eventually,
you'll curve into a fort.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Hidden Fort
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: GiantHR, EchoHT, Herb
Enemies: Sorcerer, SpearMan, Archer

The door is blocked off, but for some reason, the Dark Dragons thought it 
would be clever if they left stairs in RIGHT BESIDE the extremely fortified
door. The idiots.

I'd recommend keeping Ox in the lead so you won't need to switch to him every
time you run across a wall. Anyway, head down, and have Ox smash the way 
clear. You can get to two chests by smashing the crumbly wall to the left of
the stairs. Receive GiantHR and EchoHT. If you didn't get a SpineHR for Ox,
equip the GiantHR, and equip Nina with the EchoHT.

Skip the crumbling wall and head to the left for a chest. Receive Herb. Now
technically, you can avoid this battle, but I like to kill everything I can,
and I'm sure you share my love. So, approach the guardsmen.

After that, follow the path, going straight up, smashing the wall to continue,
curving downward, then smash the next wall. Go up, and you'll see some stairs.
Take 'em.

Right in front of you is a dude. Who isn't a good guy. Know what that means?
Boss time!

! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Toad
HP: 2300
AT: 330
EX: 6000
GO: 1500
Actions: TongueLash, GlobShot
===================
Okay, no idea why, but he only attacked Nina, and it was for a horendous range
of 84-133. He instantly killed her one time when she was at full HP. Just 
terrible luck for me, I guess.
Anyway, Ryu should ThrDr and attack, Nina should Atk-Up Ox, Karn, and herself,
then start to attack and heal, Karn should attack in Shin form, and Ox should 
attack. And down goes Toad.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Mr. Knight then dies, and for some reason, the gate to the jail lowers. People
talk a bit, you find out you only rescued the guys and the women have been
shipped off to Nabal, along with the weapon. Ox's wife is among those
prisoners. Oddly enough, Ox stays calm and says that Nabal has good security.

You'll gain control. If Karn was fused, he will now be forced out of fusion.
So, refuse and head to the right, bash down the wall, and leave the fort.
Currently, you won't be able to rescue the other prisoners. So, you'll have to
retreat back to Gant.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gant
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: B.Rang
Enemies: None

Alright, once you're here, head into the clan leaders house. If you got the
B.Rang from the Krypt like I told you to, he'll see it and fix it for you.
You'll get a free rest, and when you wake up, he'll have finished repairing it
and Ryu can now equip it. Obtain B.Rang! It's just a tiny bit weaker then the
PowerSD right now, but it can hit all enemies. So, I'd suggest equipping it.
Apparently, there was also an Iron Ogre that said a man from the Dragon Army
is around Gant and could help devise a strategy. Let's go meet him.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: None
Enemies: Slime, Flea, G.Knight, Mage

Okay, from Gant, follow the path until you hit the shore. And skip it. Keep
going north-east, and you'll see a little house. Enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: W-Man Home
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: None
Enemies: None

Talk to the old man here, and he'll see your B.Rang. He'll then blabber a bit,
but then goes into the strategy of taking a GrimFowls' egg and having it go
beserk on the Dark Dragons. 

Alright, let's get back to the Hidden Fort and head to Nabel. If you forgot 
how to get back to the fort, go to Prima and head west. There will be a shore
line on the wall, a bit to the north. Once you're on land again, head down,
follow the path, and you'll find the Hidden Fort. You should be able to go 
through the fort without much trouble. Once you gone through there, head north
to GrimFowl Woods.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: GrimFowl Woods
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: Egg
Enemies: None

Once you're here, move up to the nests. There will be a purple spotted egg in
one of them. Try to take it, and one of the GrimFowls will attack.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

===================
GrimFowl
HP: 2000
AT: 170
EX: 4200
GO: 4800
Actions: Burn Out (75)
===================
I couldn't check to see if it had anymore abilities, I killed it in two turns.
The GrimFowl is a fire creature, so Ice magic works well. However, Ryu's
physical attack is more powerful then SnowDR if he has an Atk-Up buff.
Basically, all you need to do is have Nina Atk-Up Karn[Shin], Ryu, and Ox (If
you have enough time), and attack. Down in no time flat.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After that fight, the GrimFowls will box you in, forcing you to take the egg
(Ironic, isn't it.) Obtain Egg. After that, the birds will start to follow 
you. Sometimes they will stray off, however, keep at least ONE bird when you 
exit the woods from the north. Just walk up to the them, and they should start
to follow. 

When you exit, the GrimFowl will be behind you. Walk up to the castle (it's 
just a bit nort) with the bird right behind. When you try to enter, Ryu will
automatically throw the egg in the castle. Enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Nabal
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: SkullRG, Life2
Enemies: SpearMan, Archer, Chopper

When you enter, the guardsmen will be running in circles with GrimFowls 
chasing them. You can easily enter the castle.

Unfortunately, this does NOT mean no random battles. Sucky. Anyway, head to 
the right, walk up, and a staircase is seen. However, pass by them, continuing
to the south. Push the lower vase and search the ground it covered. Receive
SkullRG. Now push the other vase and search. Receive Life2. Head down those
stairs you saw earlier.

Head south and follow the path. You'll reach a crumbling wall. Punch it down
with Ox and proceed. You'll trigger a small cutscene, and a battle.

===================
SlimeX, fused or not, does 15-41 damage.
Pathetic. They have a weakness for fire, but why bother? Smash around the 
individual SlimeX's with physical attacks from the party, destroying them with
the B.Rang. Once it fuses, keep up the physical attacks, and you win.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Oh no! They were stalling! The General can go kill off Prima now. They'll die,
and the party goes to the jail, which, logically, is still locked. 
Unlogically and conveniently, the wall right beside it is weak, so Ox smashes
through it. Ox's Wife will tell you to stop them from using the weapon. 

The General, however, escapes. The secret weapon will be revealed as a 
torpedo. Gobi will say they should go warn Prima. Ox will also reveal here 
that his wife's pregnant (BAH! She's pregnant too? How the heck did he stay so
calm? I'd go ballistic.) and he vows to stop the war before it's born.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Prima
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: Statue
Enemies: None

Yay for convenient warp. We'll be at Prima automatically. The guild leader 
will point you to Wisdon, to get the sorceress. Then he'll say to talk to the
guy upstairs.

Again, Karn has unfused automatically, so fuse him back together. Go upstairs
and talk with the old manillo in bed. Talk to him again. Now search his bed.
Obtain Statue! With this, we can enter Wisdon! And as we head out for this 
place, we move on to...

Location: Nabal
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: MagicRG, Cure
Enemies: Same as last time.

Completionists will want to make a quick detour here. Elsewise, move onto to 
the next section.

Return to Nabal and go to where you fought SlimeX. Go inside the female prison
cell, and you'll see a weak wall. Smash it with Ox, follow the path, and 
you'll reach two chests and some stairs. Inside those chests...Receive MagicRG
and Cure. The stairs will only lead back outside. Nothing special.

With that done, we now need to get to Wisdon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Arad
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: None
Enemies: None

This is where you should warp to. Don't you LOVE the people in Prima for being
SO VERY informative? (Sarcasm.) Heck, the least they could have done is say,
"Wisdon is a strange city in the desert." OR "Have you seen a moving town? 
Use the statue if you do." Seriously, these two lines could have helped.
Lousy...Heal and save and head out.

You see the little moving shrine? It hangs around Arad. Usually a bit to the
north. Enter it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Wisdon
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: Herb(x4), ProSH(x2), Life(x2), Life2, OldSP, SilverBR, RageHR, ChainML,
OldEgg
Enemies: Chopper, M.Scorp, R.Slime

There's nothing to take in the town here. The inn and shops are in ruin. The
only standing building is (as always) the dragon shrine, so save here. You'll
also see a bunch of Wisp and Cloud like population about, which you can talk
to for some info.

When you're done loitering, head down the stairs in between the Inn and 
Shrine. Follow the path, and you'll hit an intersection of left, right, and
north. Swing west, and follow the path up to a crumbly walls. Smash 'em all 
down and reap your two treasures. Receive Herb and ProSH. I'd personally give
this to Karn.

Backtrack to the intersection and head east, following the path to find a 
mirror of how the other one looked. Smash down all the walls, and take all the
treasures. Receive Life2 and Life. Get back to the intersection and go north.
You'll see some stairs going down.

Follow the path, and circle around the platform with the stairs, since there's
a chest here. You'll need to bash some rocks, but Ox-ey can handle it. Receive
OldSP. This thing is crappier then the HeroSP, so don't equip if you bought
that. Go up the stairs on the platform.

Head down off the platform, and run to the left. There will be a weak wall 
with two chests behind. Smash and take. Receive Life and SilverBR. Go back to
the stairs, and this time, head northeast from there. Go to the little hall
made by the two rooms. There should be a wall above and below you. Smash the
upper first. There's two chests. Receive Herb and RageHR. If you got the 
SpineHR, don't equip. 

Head south and smash the wall. Go down the stairs. Follow the path, and hey,
stairs going up. Use them to find yourself in a room with four treasures.
Receive ChainML, two Herbs, and ProSH. Give the ProSH to Ox, and head back 
down the stairs. Again, follow the path, and take the stairs leading you back
to a room with no chests.

Head west from there, and go north. You'll see stairs leading upward on a 
platform. Use it. 

We're back to the no-encounter surface level of Wisdon. Enter the giant shrine
that resembles a castle. Straight in front of you is a healing spring, so use
it. Once you're all healed up, go use the stairs to the right of the spring.
You should see a sleeping woman (resembling a naga, but has more human) being
guarded by three spirits. Approaching will crash lightning in front of you.
The party will run back, and the spirits move up. 

Jeez, what is with these guys and proving yourself? Get ready for a triple
battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! RE-MATCH ! !
===================
Wisp
===================
No trouble, the Wisp will be MUCH easier this time. And that's saying quite 
alot, considering that he wasn't all too hard to begin with. Have everyone 
attack, and Wisp will be gone in one or two turns.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Cloud
===================

Myst
HP: 1100
AT: 80
EX: 4000
GO: 3600
Actions: Burn Out (30), T.Bolt (All, 40)
===================
You know, for a new enemy, I was hoping for more. But no, this is what I get.
He uses new a new Burn Out and T.Bolt animation, though they don't compensate
in power. Strategy is simple, ThrDr with Ryu and attack, attack with Ox,
attack with Karn fused as Shin, and Atk-Up everyone (minus Ryu) with Nina. 
Then she just attacks.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Not as tough as you expected, huh? Anyway, they will acknowledge your
determination, and go wake the Sorceress. But she doesn't wake up with mere
words. So they use Plan B, which you should watch and find out on your own.

When Bleu awakens, Ryu will tell her about the D.Dragons attacking Prima.
She'll pace for a bit, and then give Ryu an egg. Obtain OldEgg! She'll tell 
you to stick it in a volcano to hatch it, giving birth to a bug. And this 
thing can cause Typhoons. Bleu then returns to rest.

Oif...looks like we'll need to walk out of Wisdon. Let's get back to Prima
and find an underwater volcano, since the last volcano we found erupted.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Sea Volcano
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: SharpBW, 3000G, M.Drop, 2000G, PowerDR, Herb
Enemies: AmeblobX, DogFish, CrawlerX, Tentacle

Alright, to get here, get back to the ocean. If you recall, there was a shore
line northwest of Arad. Head west until you hit Prima, and then go north. You
should see a bunch of mountains, one of them being a volcano. Enter through 
the doorway.

New underwater enemies! An annoying AmeblobX makes the scene. And an easy to
beat Tentacle. Anyway, head up until you can't anymore, and then go all the 
way to the right for a chest. Receive SharpBW. Equip onto Bo, and head to the
left a bit. Go north as soon as you can. And now it's the easy, 
no-need-to-explain generic follow the path scenario. When you see it, skip the
option of going down, and continue to the left for a chest. Receive 3000G. 
Backtrack just a bit and go south as soon as you can. Take staircase leading 
up.

Go up the next staircase, and go to the left for a chest. Receive M.Drop. Head
back down. Go south, and go east. Treasure! Receive 2000G. Go west, and head
south when you can. Follow a bit, and yet another chest awaits. Receive 
PowerDR. Go back north and keep going west. Eventually, a set of stairs should
be in sight. Take 'em!

If you can't find the next chest, I'ma targetting my sniper on you. Receive
Herb. Follow the path, and you should find yourself at a cliffish place. Stand
on the thinnest strip of rock that's jutting out, and press A. Ryu'll drop the
OldEgg and watch as it grows.

Yay, convenient teleport to Wisdon, straight to Bleu's room! She'll kinda be
upset you made it back so quickly because she wanted some more rest. Ryu will
extend an invitation to her to join the party. She accepts. New member, get!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Prima
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bleu, Bo
Items: MystSF, Sphere
Enemies: None

Woot! More convenience! You'll be brought back to Prima automatically, PLUS 
the Guild Owner gives your party a free rest. When you make a single movement,
the Owner will come in saying that the D.Dragons are attacking. The Guild
Leader will ask Bleu to help out, and Bleu answers with a battle cry (I think.
What do you think 'Gelagelagela' means?) The owner will also tell Gobi that 
he'll get his license back if he does the right thing. Ox will make another
vow. One of the Manillo's will give you a ride. 

You'll get a little war scenario of you (a lone fish) dodging canon fire from
six ships. Mister Manillo sure knows how to move. The typhoon bug saves your
butt before it gets fried. The enemy will retreat and attempt to take you out
from below. The fishy will drop you off and go battle with the enemy.

Personally, I'd suggest you run back to town to save (because you probably 
don't want to go through the Volcano again). I'd also say "Properly equip 
Bleu," but all the shop owners are out defending. 

When you're done doing whatever, go north of Prima. You should see the 
Manillos duking it out with the Dark Dragons (How are they underwater? Dammit,
everyone always seems to have Gills). Move up, and one of the Manillos will 
tell you to take out their leader. But what challenge is he if he doesn't 
transform?

===================
Pincher
HP: 1000
AT: 190
EX: 4800
GO: 4800
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 95)
===================
His regular attack does around 38 damage.
He has a weakness for electricity. So, exploit! I recommend having Bo out 
instead of Karn's Shin fusion, so he can cast Fry. So, to put the strategy 
forward: Ryu attack as ThrDr, Nina casting Shield on low HP characters (and
healing if necessary), Bleu casting Fry, and Bo casting Fry. Your attack force
is doing 435 a round, so this sucker will be down in four turns (since Ryu
spends a round transforming). Beware, however, of his Gale spell, it'll wreak
havoc on your party if he decides to use it.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

The General is going to make a suicidal effort to take out Prima. The Manillos
don't believe him, and start poking at him. However, it wasn't a bluff, and
the screen goes shaky and fades into white.

Ooo, a view of the bad guys. Zog will compliment Jade for his work, saying 
that things are going accordingly (what the heck is going to his plan? We've
been bashing vital points for a while now...). However, the news of the 
failure in Prima worries him, thinking the Light Dragons are screwing his 
search for the keys (Haha, sucker, he didn't get his hands on one, and if he 
did, Ryu always stole it). Receiving the order to destroy the Light Dragons 
and to gain the Keys, Jade departs.

You'll also get to see his four underlings, Cerl, Goda, Cort, and Mote. And 
he'll command them to do what Zog commanded him to do (I love making confusing
sentences). They leave. Jade ponders a moment.

Back to Prima, still looking good. The Owner notes that if the suicidal bomb
general was any closer, Prima would be fried. Gobi makes a fully announced
joining of the party. Not 'cause he likes anyone in there, but because of the
debt. Lousy sneaking rat. You'll automatically leave Prima, but Gobi will 
notice he's missing something. Enter back and head to the Guild Owners' house
and talk to him. Two chests will drop down. Pick 'em both up. Receive MystSF,
and obtain Sphere! With this, Gobi can change into a big fish, allowing travel
underwater with NO random encounters! I have no idea what the MystSF does 
though. Bet it's just stylish.

Anyway, with that done, we head out into the full scope of the underwater 
world. Next on our to-do list, get Ryu his next set of super-powers!

(TRIVIAL - Overworld theme changes yet again!)

Press A with Gobi in the lead, and he'll change into a big fish. Yay. Head to
the Sea Volcano. See to the left of it? That giant pit? Cross it. From here,
follow the bottom wall (heading left), until you're at a bunch of jagged 
rocks. Keep going left, and you'll hit the bottom of an island. Circle around
to the south of it, and enter through the shore.

On land, there isn't much but a town. So, go into it.

Y'know, it boggles the mind why they would put two IDENTICAL shops in very 
close proximity to each other, and have one bashing the prices of the other.
Guess Capcom just gets a laugh out of the fact that an unsuspecting player
realizes he coulda saved quite a bit of gold...

Anyway, the flea market equipment isn't too much of an upgrade. So, do any
shopping you want in the other weapons store, and restock on items in the 
flea market's items shop.

If you haven't already noticed, you can't understand what the people say,
aside from the business managers ('cause they're Manillo). Visiting the 
insides of the houses is pretty much pointless. There's one with a foresight
on an event to come, but eh, I'd rather wait then have it spoiled.

So, let's get what we came for. Enter the top-most building, which happens to
be a castle. Walk forward, then head to the right and follow the path until 
you hit some stairs. Use them, then use the next. Walk to the left until you
hit the wall (don't bother trying to open the gate to the items, Karn can't
pick the lock for some reason). Go north, and try to take the chest, but a 
hole will open up. And one of the stone gremlins come to life. They shove you
down the hole.

You SHOULD be in a room with two people, an old man and a younger man, with a
bed. If you're just outside, you didn't listen to me when I said "walk left
until you hit the wall." Anyway, if you DID listen to what I said, move the
box just south of the bed and search the ground. Receive Rod5! Awesome, we can
now get our super dragon equipment for Ryu! Move the box to the left of that
one, and you'll fall down another hole. Two chests await. Receive Herb and 
Melon. Walk to the south and take the stairs and you'll be out of Tunlan.

There isn't anymore to do here, so there's no point in re-entering. Instead,
let's go do some fishing. If you haven't already, stop by Prima to pick up
some worms. Either the regular or the souped-up "2" version should work. I'd
say don't waste your money on the Worm2s though.

When you're done, Warp to Romero, and exit the town.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, Bo or Karn[Shin], whoever else.
Items: DragonSD
Enemies: (Romero) Things that die in one hit
        (Around the Well) Crab, Warlock, Buzzer, LancerX.

When you're here, have Bo or Shin in the lead, and walk to the northwest, 
passing by Agua. Once you hit the corner, go south along the mountain range,
then head west after you pass by the tree. You should see a well. Have Ryu,
equipped with the Rod5 and Worms, make an attempt at fishing in the well. If
you don't get anything, keep trying. Soon enough, you'll get what you were
aiming for. Receive DragonSD! Equip onto Ryu for a major boost in attack.
And now you can go get his next set of Dragon spells! (Finally)

However! Since you can, you might as well get another piece of the Dragon
equipment. (So no, not JUST yet...) Warp to Arad, and exit the town.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ryu, anyone else.

Enemies: Remember those desert dudes? They aren't nearly as tough anymore.

From Arad, walk south until you see the Krypt, then run ALL the way to the 
west. Then head southish, and soon, you'll see a well. GO FISH! Again, try try
again if at first you don't succeed. Receive DragonHT, THE strongest helmet of
the entire game! But it's all for Ryu. Hehe.

Right, with that done, we can now get those spells we've been putting off.
Fo' realz this time, yo. Get to Prima, either by taking the shore path near 
the desert, or warping to Gant and using the shore near there.

Once you're there, head off to the west, and take the shore a bit north of the
wall you just rammed into. Look familiar? It should. Follow the path south and
go through the Hidden Fort again. Once you're outta there, head west, and 
follow the paths given by the mountains. Head south when you can, and then
continue to follow. You'll see the shrine soon.

===================
Bain deals 13-21 damage, and can (but very rarely) cause slams.
I'm sure that in any other FAQ, you'll find them talking about how cool Bain
looks. I agree. Anyway, since this is a Ryu solo battle, you don't have what
we call "variety" in your abilities. Bain also does not have a weakness. Thus,
all you do is ThrDr and set it to 'AUTO' if you're playing the GBA version.
If you're using the SNES, just keep pressing the A button. Bain will do 
significantly less damage to you in Drake form, so you probably won't even 
need to heal. Heck, if you want, you can take him out without transforming, 
though do pack some form of healing items in your inventory. Bain goes down
easy.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

The Dragon Lord grants you your new spells, and disappears in a poof. With 
that done, leave the shrine, and go test your abilities near a free Inn. When
all that's done, let's make way for Gust.

We'll start from the crevasse. Head all the way west until you hit the wall,
then start going north. When you see some coral reefs, swim to the right a 
bit and you should see a shoreline. Take it to get onto land.

WorldML  - 22000G    Cure   - 2000G

WorldML and FlameSH for Ox-ey, WorldML and MoonBW for Bo, and that's pretty 
much it. Stop by the inn and give the drawer a look. Receive Sash. Equip onto
one of your strong characters (Karn, Ox). 

If you haven't already, talk to the people of the town. You'll notice some of
them are insane. The competent ones will give you light info. There's also a
flutemaker (Tunlan communication!), but he's insane as well. Apparently the
cause of this is the north wind. Better go check it out then, huh? But first!
Go pay a visit to the flutemakers house (The top-left one). See that box near
the barrels on the right side of the screen? Move it to fall down a hole.

There's a little puzzle here, which shouldn't take you too long to figure out.
You gotta move the barrels in the proper way to get inside the room. I'll tell
you here in case you're stuck (but then you're sorta an idiot for using this.)

Move the lowest one to the left or right, and walk into the middle of the
middle row. Push each barrel outward. Now, push the left and right barrels of
the top row forward. Then push the top-middle barrel to the left or right.
You started with this.
==========
() - Barrel
 | - Wall

 |      |
 |()()()|
  ()  ()

Should look like this when you're done.

 |()  ()|

      ()

Sorry if you can't understand, but hell, that's the best I can do. Go into the
room, and you'll see a mentor with the flamy torches by his side. Talk to him
with Karn in the lead, and whaddyaknow? A new fusion spell! Though, I say this
one is near useless considering you hardly ever get the chance to use it.

Leave through the stairs to the south, re-enter Gust, and exit the town from 
the north end. Head up north, and you'll reach the next area of Gust. Walk
north, and you'll see there are these flowers which are shooting out crazy
pollen. You can't do anything to it, so pass by and open the gate. Enter.

Location: Lab
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: Herb, Cure2, L.Ptn, Rod4

Head to the left and walk north. When all of a sudden, poof! A monster 
appears!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
Rogue
HP: 2000
AT: 100
EX: 2520
GO: 1200
Actions: Bite, OrbShot, Attack All
Drops: Herb
=====================
These guys LOOK menacing, but they're very, very wimpy when it comes to 
defense. Everyone (Nina included) should cause 300+ with their regular 
attacks. Heck, if Karn[Shin] scores a slam, he'll cause 999 damage. No 
strategy needed.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Walk north, and you'll see a chest. Receive Herb. Head back south, and walk
all the way east until you hit the wall. Go north to trigger another battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! FORCED BATTLE ! !
=====================
Rogue
=====================
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Take the chest behind it. Receive Cure2. Head south, and take the middle road.
You'll have three pathways going to the north. Two of them have chests. All
roads are guarded by Rogues. I say, kill all the Rogues, because they are easy
experience. Take the leftmost road and trigger the fight.

Rogue
=====================
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After you beat that one, run to the back of the room, and have Ox smash the
wall. Go all the way to the left, all the way to the north, and up the stairs.

Oh no! It's Cort, one of Jade's four! But what a crappy introduction. He 
shoulda been like "Room darken, flash, flash, Ta-daahh!" But he just walks in,
NOT being cocky-villain like (no fun whatsoever), and he throws a potion at 
you. He then leaves. The screen pinkens! And you shrink! Well, at least you 
enjoy no random encounters for a bit. From the stairs, walk north, passing by
the next set of stairs, until you hit a wall. Then run to the right, and you 
should see a little mouse hole. Enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Mouse Hole
Party: Ryu, Nina, Ox, Karn[Shin]
Items: Herb, M.Cura
Enemies: Roach

Just follow the path, and you should find alotta mice. They all say the same
thing, except two. One lets you proceed further, and the other gives you a 
free resting place. Take a break at the Mouse Inn, and talk to the mouse just
north of that one. The other one will move out of the way for you to continue.

Follow the path yet again, and when you get the option, take the right path
(Left one is a dead end). Eventually, you'll find a bunch of cheese, and some
purple roaches. Battle time!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
! ! MINI-BOSS BATTLE ! !
========================
K.Roach (times three)
HP: 2800
AT: 100
EX: 460
GO: 200
Actions: Attack
========================
Even though I gave Morte and Mortea a BOSS BATTLE heading, and just made a 
little note of them being Mini-Bosses, there's no way I'm doing that with 
these guys. THEY ARE PATHETIC. Heck, I was attempted to say "FORCED BATTLE".
Karn[Shin] should be doing 999 a hit, or dang near close to there, Ryu should
be at 700+, Ox-ey should be around 600-700+, and Nina is about 450-500+. They
each have a second wind, which is annoying, because they're faster then you.
That means, they get three hits, Shin obliterates one's health bar, sending it
to second wind, and restarting the round. They basically get 5 free hits! But
Nina should be able to compensate if they have been focusing on one member. If
not, don't stop attacking for anything.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

After that, backtrack to the mouse lair. They'll block the exit out, so you
have to accept their items. Take a break, and talk to the mouse just above 
the Inn mouse. He'll move aside. Follow him up the path, and take the two 
chests. Receive Herb and M.Cura. As soon as Ryu takes the M.Cure, he'll run
outside, so make sure you get the Herb first. You'll be back to regular size.

Take the stairs down. Let's go kicky Cort!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Lab
Party: Ryu, Nina, Ox, Karn[Shin]

Enemies: D.Knight, Buzzer, Warlock, Bain 
(Yeah, real smart Capcom, make two enemies have the same name, it's brilliant)

Take the hover, follow the path and take the next hover, take the south path 
for the next hover, follow the path for another hover, and then take the top
hover.

If you can make any sense out of that, good for you. If not, it's very, very
simple to get by, so if you need any help, you need REAL help. 

Eventually, you'll run into Cort, with his Gremlin recolour by his side. He
calls for it to attack.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
RugaX
HP: 1400
AT: 170
EX: 3200
GO: 2400
Actions: Bite, OrbShot, Attack All
===================
RugaX does somewhere around 40-60 damage with its attacks.
You know, I'm curious as to why this Ruga is X-ed up, but weaker then the 
original Ruga. In terms of HP and Attack Power, anyway. This one's worth more.
Not much to this, pound it down with physicals. If you want, you could switch
Ox out for Bleu and have her storm away with Chills or F.Balls or Blasts, or
whatever the heck she has in her bag o' tricks at this time. You could also 
have Ryu BltDgn to make him go away all the more quicker. Doesn't really 
matter.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Cort will tell you that his flower will make you go insane. Then he runs. 
RugaX here will change into a man. He says (with NO gasps in between) that the
flower made the village go crazy and him into a monster. Nina will try a shot
at healing the guy with Cura2. Doesn't work though. Nina, maybe you could use
Renew first, or Cura4, because I swear you know how to use those. Bleu will
say that her spell's too weak (try a stronger one! YOU HAVE THEM!), and get
Ryu and Ox to carry him back to town. Everyone leaves, except Nina, who makes
a little comment, before going herself.

Joy to convenient warps. We're back at Gust. Tina will come in, somehow 
knowing everything that happened, down to the details. Bleu will say she'll
heal him, but we know Bleu's arsenal, and I doubt she's going to try to bomb
him back to health. She'll say she needs frog oil and sends the party to get 
it.

You won't have Bleu in your party for a bit. But it's fine. We only need to 
last without her for one quest, and it's not like she was of much help in
random battles. Now, if we lost someone like KARN...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Frog Cave
Party: Gobi, anyone else
Items: None
Enemies: None

To get here is pretty simple. Go to the Gust shore and go underwater. Have
Gobi change into the Big Fish, and go all the way south. When you get to the 
Tunlan island, swim to the right of it. You should see some jagged rocks. Swim
on top of them, and then go south. Use the shore there.

Just south of the shore is a cave. Enter it.

The frogs here can talk. Scary. Most of them offer you some Oil, but they 
don't actually give it to you (that'd be too easy). Others will ask if you 
like frogs. However, we ALL know that the only one with good information is
surrounded by rock. Talk to him, and he'll ask for a big G.Fly to eat. THAT
ROTTEN! Gragh. Well, if you talked to everyone in Gust, you might remember a
man standing at the entrance of a cave saying how a fly stole his lunch. Let's
hunt that one down.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gust Cave
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox (Or anyone, to be honest)
Items: G.Fly
Enemies: None

When you're at Gust, walk to the left, and go up the stairs. Go past the goat,
and you'll see a man beside a cave. Enter that cave.

It's a very simple cave. There's only one path. If you cannot locate the G.Fly
may God bless you. But, of course we can't just slap the fly and bring it 
back. NOOOO...we gotta pound it into a fine mist.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! MINIBOSS BATTLE ! !
=======================
G.Fly
HP: 1000
AT: 170
EX: 5600
GO: 6400
Actions: Attack
Drops: Herb
=======================
It can cause 32-46 damage.
Destroy it with multiple physcial attacks. Or, if you're just pissed off at 
this side-quest, you can BltDgn with Ryu, and Atk-Up all your members to truly
turn this thing to dust.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After you kill it, run and pick it up. Obtain G.Fly! With this, we can shove 
it down that dang Frog's throat and hopefully he'll spew up some oil! Get back
to the Frog Cave, pronto!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Frog Cave
Party: Doesn't matter
Items: Oil
Enemies: None

Once you're here, talk to the Froggy that asked for the G.Fly. He'll exchange
Oil for it. Obtain Oil! With this, we can heal what's-his-name. Now we have
to go back to Gust. Don't you just LOVE running in circles?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gust
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Shin], Ox
Items: Maestro
Enemies: None

Go to Tina's house, and talk to Bleu. Bleu will take it and sprinkle it onto
Nicolie. First thing he says when he wakes up is a very logical thought. If 
the Flower gets the chance to spread it's seeds, billions of it will grow and
the world will go insane. Eh, I'd say we're all insane already. Bleu will stay
back. She tries to glimpse into the future, but the ball explodes. Bleu isn't
worried though (WHAT?! I'd be freaked if my ball went haywire). Alright, let's
go kill that plant. Head to the north.

My my, if it isn't our good pal Cort. And checkit that flower! It's been 
X-ified!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
FlowerX
HP: 2900
AT: 250
EX: 3200
GO: 3000
Actions: Attack, Poison
===================
It only got one regular attack in (it used Poison on two of the three turns it
was alive), and it did 92 damage to Shin. However, Shin seems to take more
damage then everyone else, and if I killed it in three turns and forgot to 
heal ever since coming back from the Lab, I doubt you need to worry.
You know, being a flower, you'd think it'd be weak to fire, what with RPG 
physics and all. But no, it still takes 210 from FirDgn. So, BltDgn attacks 
with Ryu, regular attacks from Ox, regular attacks from Karn fused as Shin, 
and Nina powering up everyone and healing poison wherever.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After that plant's death, the little flowers will also explode off. Cort will
stay calm, and then proceed to running away like a little girl. Nina'll make
a small comment, and you can return to the town.

Well, everyone certainly looks more sane. Talk to some of them, and they'll be
won't recall what they were doing last. Go to Nicolie's House, and Bleu will
congratulate you for destroying the flower (I think. She says it as more of a
statement). Nina and Gobi will pick up some noise, and if you didn't see from
the top of the screen, RugaX is back. Tina will then apologize, and say that
if they can't change him back, then it's best to put him out. Looks like we'll
be forced to do that right now.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
! ! RE-MATCH ! !
================
RugaX
================
Same as before. Funny thing is, I STILL didn't remember to heal, so I only had
enough AP on Ryu for IceDgn. Oh well, it'll still kill him quick. Anyway,
Nina boosts everybody, everybody else attacks. Or, set it to AUTO. You'll win.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Tina will ask Bleu for another shot at changing him back. Bleu will go up to
him, freak out, and shoot a nice shock of lightning at him. And it looks like
she charred him so badly that he's actually ash-grey now. But wait! Somehow,
the grey changes back to regular colour, and he's alright! My god! He only 
needed to suffer two MASSIVE beatings, and a hyper-bolt! To thank you, he'll
go off to repair the bridge. Yeah, because you OBVIOUSLY don't need to rest
after going through all that. You however, get a free rest at the house. Yay.

Alright, with the bridge completed, we can go to Scande! Do talk to the people
before you leave, now that they're competent again. Also, go get your flute
from Mr. Flutemaker. Talk to him twice, and then search his bed. Obtain 
Maestro! With this, we can communicate with the people of Tunlan (can't 
understand them though).

So, let's check out that bridge, because we all know that Nicolie is inhuman
and can finish building the bridge in a single night. You'll see him lying on
the bridge. Approach him, but oh no! It's Cort! Cort's really angry now 
because Nicolie isn't under his control, and he transforms to fight you. 

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
HornToad
HP: 4000
AT: 195
EX: 6800
GO: 7000
Actions: Squash, Earthquake(All)
===================
He can attack one party member with Squash or use an Earthquake attack (which
isn't a Devistate), each doing 21-52 damage. He'll get an attack increase on
his second wind.
Well, well. I think you should have an idea on how to fight by now. Ryu cast
BltDgn and attack non-stop, Karn attack non-stop fused as Shin, Nina cast 
Atk-Up on herself and Karn, then go on to attacking and healing (She actually
does pretty nice damage to Cort), and Bleu blasting out her Blast Spells, or
whatever her strongest magick is.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Oo, looks like Cort over-estimated himself. Nicolie, completely not caring 
that Cort came back, happily informs you that the bridge is complete and ready
for crossing.

So let's cross that bridge and get to Scande! Turn the page to...

From the bridge, head south, and turn west as soon as you can. Keep going west
and you'll reach a battered land. You should see a little mole girl over a 
hole around. Follow her, and she'll retreat downward. Enter the hole.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gramor
Party: Doesn't matter
Items: Cowl
Enemies: None

You'll see her again, blocking the entrance to a room, but she'll go inside.
Follow her, and you'll find yourself in a room with a bunch of mole people. 
Talk to all of them, and then talk to the one beside the sleeping mole. She'll
(Least, I think it's a she) will say that in order to enter his dream, an item
from Tunlan must be retrieved. She'll ask you to help. Agree, and she'll give
you an item. Obtain Cowl! With this, we can understand the people of Tunlan.
With both the Cowl and Maestro, we can establish full communication. Hopefully
you head there when I asked you to, so make a quick warp. Elsewise, you'll 
need to go by sea. There are directions higher up, which I don't feel like
re-explaining. 
...Fine! Head into the sea from a shore (any shore), and make your way to the
chasm just west of the Sea Volcano. From there, follow the south wall until 
you reach some spikety-spikes, in which you should skip and continue west.
You'll ram into the side of the island.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Tunlan
Party: Doesn't matter
Items: M.Drop, Melon(x2), Bolster
Enemies: None

Well, I'm not going to retell where each itme is. Go scroll up, lazy. Anyway,
you can now understand the people here, so talk. You know, it's strange that
there isn't a single man in the group of people. The only one is that guy from
Gust hanging at the Inn...oh, and the Manillo business managers. I think. I 
never knew how to tell a boy Manillo from a girl Manillo...

Where was I? Oh yeah. Talk to everyone, enter people's houses and talk to 
them. They give quite a bit of information. One'll say the Bolster will allow
people to enter dreams. Sounds like what we're looking for. Another will 
mention the TmKey. Well, can't let any keys skip our hands, can we? After all,
we only need two more. Eventually, enter the castle, right at the top of the
town. (Psst...Nina lookalike, ohmigodwhere!?)

Go up, and talk to the green robed lady. She'll ask for your help, and give 
you the Bolster in return. Agree, and she'll tell you that the princess is
going to marry Zog and give him the TmKey. Why? Because she wants eternal 
youth for everlasting beauty. Oh freakin' hell, one of THESE kinds of girls.

Well, let's give it a shot. Go up the stairs and talk to her. Figures. She's a
dimwit. Head back downstairs, and chat with the old lady. She'll then suggest
taking the Key without her noticing. The lady will then proceed to walk so...
very...slowly. 

Once she goes up the stairs, you'll have control. Make sure it's night time 
before you do the next step. Just go outside and use your DkKey if it isn't 
(hey, there was a time to actually use it). Anyway, when it is night, use the 
stairs you saw the old lady take. Go down the next set right after, but head 
back up the same set. Walk left, through the wall, and you'll be in the 
Princess's bath area. Woo, porno. Walk to the foremost tree-in-a-pot and press
A. Ryu'll examine the markings on her back. After that pinkish glow, walk down
the stairs again to the treasure room. Talk to the old lady, and she'll note 
the order of unlocking.

She'll ask you to press the left door, and then the right. The door, however,
does not unlock. The elder will realize you saw the code in a reflection, 
therefore, you entered it backwards. She'll cry for you to reverse it, but 
it's too late. The stone gremlins will make their move, locking you up. The 
Princess and the guards arrive. The gremlins then go commit suicide (WHY!?).
Anyway, watch the next scene. It is, by FAR, the most character developing 
you'll see in this game, not including the ending. And you get to see a cat
war. Coulda done with some more sprites though...

Well, after all that, the TmKey is lost. However, that wasn't our initial goal
to do here in Tunlan. That was just a lucky coincidence. We're here for the 
Bolster. With the Gremlins having commited suicide (Why...) and the gates 
blown to ash, we can access all the goodies. Remember to open the far left and
far right chests from the SIDE, because that hole is still in front of it. 
Receive M.Drop, two Melons, and obtain Bolster! With this, we can enter Mogu's
dream and fight off his demons FOR him. Pah, I thought the whole point to 
inner demons was to fight for yourself, and emerge a stronger person. But not
here! It's time we head back to Gramor. Overall, I loved this side-quest, 
since it didn't involve monsters, and characters actually got more
PERSONALITY. Some anyway. The ones I liked, and I guess that's all that 
matters. Gramor, Gramor, let's go before I forget again.

Well, let's enter Mogu's dream world then. Talk to the old lady who gave you
the Cowl, and she'll ask if you're ready. When you say yes, you'll be thrust
into Mogu's head.

You know, the closer I get to this scenario, the more I remember about my
first-playthrough in the dream world, and how I utterly detested it. I can't
seem to remember why though...

Well, here we are, a dream. And I gotta say, it's VERY stable considering what
real dreams are like. But that's a good thing. The last thing I want to do is
battle midget-eating hammers that wear baseball caps backwards, and are pissed
off at you because you didn't call them by their name, "Johnny McJohn-John."
Which they then proceed to shoot flower petals that are faster then arrows, 
but hard as a stone, etc. etc.

Anyway, once you enter two people, assumingly Mogu's sister and his father or
grandfather, will greet you, dropping off tid-bits of info. Exit the house.
Dream Town is nice. No one occupies the houses, but DreamTown is nice...Hm,
Mogu runs an Item Shop / Inn. Why the heck he needs money in his dream is 
beyond me, but here's what we have.

There's also a Dragon Shrine, which you should save at. You'll also see the
different sides of Mogu. Each has scarcely any info to share. When all is 
done, head out into the twisted world.

What a small world. But that's a good thing. Head to the right, and follow the
path as it curves upward. You'll reach the tower very soon.

Location: Devil Tower
Party: Ryu, Karn[Shin], anyone else

Enemies: Chopper, Zoom, D.Knight, Warlock

Oh. Now I remember. Because it's weirded! Once you step on the grey ball, all
signs of walls will be gone. Tch. Walk up, and you'll be forced to step on a
grey. You should see two pinks, one on each side of you. Stepping on these
make the walls come back.

Now, there are multiple paths to get you where you want to go. I will tell you
the one I thought was easiest. Walk to the right, and follow the path. Turn 
left as soon as you can, and follow again, until you hit a north/south choice.
Go north, and again, follow. Go south when you get the option. Stick to the 
lower paths. When you can, turn east, and follow the path. You'll be lead into
a young boy.

Talk to him. He'll be sure in the knowledge that he's undefeatable if Mogu's
senses are scattered. He'll give you the option to fight. Either answer is 
fine. If you choose to fight, run immediately. All magic will result in a 
'Miss' and all attacks will result in a 'Fail' (Heck, I was getting non-stop
slams too. Lousy...) You'll have to take the insult for now. Leave Devil Tower
through the way you came in.

...You don't remember, do you? Gah, what I do for you people. Head south, and
follow the path. Go north, follow, skip the first path leading up and keep 
going. Head to the right, follow, go right as soon as you can. Head south, and
follow the path. You'll be homefree.

Make your way back to dream town. The mole girl will be on the world map. 
She'll tell you she found where Mogu's courage is. Go inside the town.

Well, heal and save, and go in the house you came from. Talk to the girl, and
she'll say a wise old man fixed the bridge to the south, which is wear courage

Head to the west. There should be a rope bridge going south. Use it, and head
east. You should see a cave and a bunch of jagged rocks. Enter through the 
only opening the rocks create.

Ahh...the Wilderness. Here's a little trick Capcom made: The skeleton bodies
on the floor are actually harmful walls. So, you still have 'paths' and 
'roads', meaning I can be lazy and say follow the path.

So, do so. They'll make you go zig-zag all over the map. Eventually, they will
give you an option of north or west. Go north, to immediately receive two more
options, east or north. Go east, and follow the skeleton lined road. A chest
will await you at the end. Receive LightSH. Equip onto Nina or Bleu, if you 
didn't already get them this in Prima.

Backtrack, and head north this time. You should notice that gaps between the
skeletons are slowly becoming wider, however, you can't walk between them. 
You need to use the cracks on the floor as a rough guideline. Walk to the 
east, and follow the cracks along the floor. You'll reach a chest. Receive
Life. Keep going, and you'll reach the end of the path, with an another chest.
Receive HeadGear. Backtrack all the way to the giant cracked field, with a 
lower or higher path choices. Take the higher path.

This parts a little tricky to explain, because a lot of the steam jets are 
invisible. Walk left until you hit the crack, then walk straight up, stopping
right behind the pile of bones. From here, walk to the right, stopping when 
you're infront of the bone line. Walk north, stopping behind the skeleton, and
then take a single step to the right. Walk north, and turn when you're behind
the line of bones. Take a step to the left, and go north, left when you hit
the line of bones, and then north when you can walk inbetween the two blue
rocks.

YES! We're out of there! Walk into the cave.

Walk straight up, and talk to the Mogu on the chair. Cutscene occurs, everyone
from DreamTown comes in (How did they cross the Wilderness?) and, in the end,
Mogu joins your party!

And I need to say, he downright sucks right now. Lookit that HP! To think, he
challenged Mote! Well, anyway, you're going to need to go through the 
Wilderness again. This is why I loved packing some Mrbl3s. Not sure if you 
did, but yeah. It shouldn't be hard, either way.

Make your way back to town, heal and save (How come the inn and shop keepers
are still there? Shouldn't they be fused with Mogu, since they're GREED?)
And head out for Devil Tower again.

Location: Devil Tower

constantly heal him)

I'll assume you remember how to get to Mothro. Talk to him, and he'll retreat
to the top of the tower. FREAKING! Argh. It was too good to be true, to face
him on the first floor and be done with it. Well, at least there isn't any
treasure that you'll need to go out-of-reach to get.

Hoo, alright, let's get this started. Walk down and pass the pink ball. Circle
around upward, and you'll hit a grey ball. Walk all the way up, and walk all
the way right. Go all the way south, and go all the way west. See that pink
ball just north of you? Press it. Now head up a bit, and go west as soon as 
you can. Follow the path, and go up the stairs.

Follow the path, and you'll hit a grey ball. Nuts. Head east all you can,
south all you can, east all you can, and south till you get into the middle
of the grey balls, and head east, until you hit a wall. North until you hit
a wall, and west until you hit a wall. Now, walk five steps north, and turn
east. Walk until you hit a wall, north until you hit a pink ball, in which you
just follow the path and not ram into anymore walls. Up the stairs!

You don't need help here. Eventually, you'll run into the boy again. Battle!

===================
Mothro
HP: 3500
AT: 210
EX: 6000
GO: 8000
Actions: Poison, Time Out, Shock!
===================
Well, a boss with no physicals. And his other attacks suck pretty bad. Poison
and Paralysis? Get real. However, he'll can also use Shock! the instant kill 
spell that has 50% chance of working. There's really not much you can do 
against that, so just don't let up with attacks. This is the reason I'd 
recommend Ox instead of Nina. Have Ox and Karn[Shin] attacking, Ryu attacking
as Bolt Dragon, and Bleu shooting Chars and Novas and such and such. Ox should
use Heal if someone gets poisoned, but since the super forms aren't affected 
by status ailments, it's only him and Bleu that are at risk. Mothro goes down
without much trouble.

Well, there goes that scenario. Mogu'll join you in real life. And with Mogu
we can dig into those dragon-marked dirt patches. JOYFUL! Warpeth to Camlon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Hidden Rooms
Party: Mogu, anyone
Items: Clog, L.Ptn, A.Ptn, V.Ptn, Slab
Enemies: Loads of different kinds

Hidden Room 1:
Well, this will be the section for digging. Exit Camlon, and head north of
the ashes of Nanai. Straight north of there, should be a patch. With Mogu in
front, dig down. Hey! It's a mentor man! Have Karn talk to him, and you'll 
gain a new fusion, Doof (Doof? Feh, the original name was Rankuru, they 
coulda called him Rank. Anything but the stereo-typical super-strong idiot 
name). Exit through the warp.

Hidden Room 2:
Warp to Tantar, and exit. Head north and cross the stone bridge, keep going
north and up the ramp. Follow the dirt road until it reaches the large ramp.
Go east a bit, then up north, and you'll see the dig patch. Enter in! You'll 
be in the hidden room, with four chests at each corner. Receive Clog (Boom
trap, insta-kill to lead member), L.Ptn, A.Ptn, and V.Ptn (Sproing trap, heals
lead member to full). Open the top-left before the top-right. Or, just have 
Karn open them. 

While you're close, you may want to go and find a vital item (That really
only serves as a clue to another event). Head back to Tantar, and travel 
west. Follow the coastline north for a well. With the Rod5 and some bait,
try fishing in it, and you'll pull it out. Obtain Slab! With this...we don't
get anything spectacular. It's just a hint.

That's all we can access for now. There's more, but you can't reach them yet.
However...let's go juice-up Karn to his maximum potential. Warp to Gust!

Location: Gust, Bleak
Party: Karn, anyone
Items: EarthRB, ClearCL
Enemies: None

At Gust, take a swing by the Flute maker's house. You should see one a heavy
crate near the kitchen area, which even Ox can't push aside. Double his
power! Have Karn merge to Doof and push the crate in any direction. Then,
examine the ground. Receive EarthRB. Immensely powerful. Equip onto someone
you like. Next stop is Bleak.

Enter the house behind the Dragon Shrine. A giant crate and a pot are in the
way of a hole entrance. Have Karn fuse into Doof, and have him push the crate
north. Push the pot to the side, and drop down. You should see two barrels. 
Push the left one north, and the right one to the right, and walk up to the 
crate. Push it aside, and search the ground. Receive ClearCL! This is an 
amazing piece of armor for the females, so equip onto one of them.

Next, go back up the stairs, and head into the room in the north-west corner.
Push aside the big crate, and you'll drop down a hole. Hey, a mentor man! Talk
to him with Karn (Revert to regular form first) and you'll receive THE most
powerful fusion of all, Puka (Jeydo in the original, but shortening it to 
Jade wouldn't have worked. I like Puka anyway). With Puka, we trigger another
treasure hunt.

Location: Hidden Rooms

Hidden Room 1:
Warp to Auria, and exit the town. Just north of the town, you should see a 
gate with a dragon mark on it. Press A against it with Puka in the lead, and
it will move aside. Enter, and take the chest. Receive DarkBR.

Hidden Room 2:
Warp to Gust, and exit the town from the south. Head southwest, and go to the
shore. Just north of the shore is another wall. Puka screeches, and the door
opens. Enter, and take the chest. Receive LoveBR.

And that's that, let's go to the place we were suppposed to go to. Do you have
any idea where that is? Heh. Warp to Gramor, and exit. Head south, and you'll
see the entrance to a cave. Enter.

Ah...a simplistic, one-option cave. No need for explaining, just follow what

very easy. You'll be outside very soon.

West of the exit is a town. Enter!

Enemies: None

Well, here we are, the town of Spring. And, I hope you realized that something
isn't right. But before we start questioning the people, let's see what's 
they have for taking.

Take a stop at the inn for a drawer. Receive Clog. The house to the left of
the inn also has a drawer. Receive Herb. And, the shops.

=====
Shops

Inn: 100G

EQUIPMENT             ITEMS
PowerDR  -  5500G     Mrbl3  - 10G
RustCW   -  7000G     Herb   - 10G

SpineCL  -  8000G     Charm  - 150G
GaiaMask -  8000G     Cure   - 2000G
QuartzAR - 10000G

Nothing here is worth buying except the QuartzAR for Karn (My god, poor Karn
has to cope with such limited equipment...In terms of Armour, anyway). Now's 
the time to question the people.

You'll find out that the Spyre to the south of the lake controls the weather,
and only a mole person can dig through. Luckily, we got Mogu for that. It's
like, practically the only thing he's good at. Because it's winter, the lake
is frozen, so you can use the stairs beside the item shop or the other set
south of the town to get onto the lake. Travel south, and you'll end up closer
to the Spyre. Go south and have Mogu dig onto the patch, and you'll be inside.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Spyre
Party: Ryu, Nina, Bleu, Karn[Puka]
Items: Cure2, A.Ptn, Shell, FlameAR, WorldAR
Enemies: BlazeX, Golem, Wraith, WraithX, D.Flea, Flower, Warlock, D.Knight, 
Zoom, Buzzer, Slime, Flea, Zombie, Ameblob, Zard, Blurb, Prickle, Cactus, 
Sandclod, Scorp, Phoenix

(Enemies list was a frickin' killer to do)

Once you enter, run forward, and take the stairs. Be careful, BlazeX will
most likely kill one of your members with it's 400 damage T.Bolt.

After heading downstairs, go south and take the left path. It'll take you to
a chest. Receive Cure2. Now, backtrack to the stairs, and take the right
path this time. Go up the stairs, and head right. Follow the path, and you'll
reach a rockish area. There should be a ramp, and two chests around. Take 
them. Receive A.Ptn and Shell. Go back up the ramp, and use the narrow 
man-made bridge. You'll reach a pillar filled area, however, skip the stairs,
and keep going to the left. Across the bridge are two chests. Receive FlameAR
and WorldAR. Go back to the pillars, onto the platform, and go up those 
stairs.

After going up the next set, you'll be in a giant grass covered area. Feel
free to slaughter the slimes. From the platform, head to the right until you
see the wall, and head north. You'll see the platform with stairs. Go up!

Oo, rainy. The monsters here are a bit tougher then the ones on the last floor
but one-hit kills are still do-able. From the stairs, head south until you see
the wall, then head west. Here are the next set of stairs on a platform.

Desert. Again, tougher slightly, but everything is insta-killed. Head south
until you see the wall, and go east. Eventually, the next platform will be
in sight.

Winter. The enemies are now back at your level. Aw..it was nice to just breeze
through all the random encounters. Ah well, the next staircase is just north
of where you came out of.

Awesome! The Sky! And you get to meet the oh so cool looking Phoenix! Head 
west until you see the wall, then go south. Next set of stairs is here.

Whoa...Space. Just love that cosmic feel. Head north from the stairs, until 
you see the wall, then head east. You'll see the platform that you need to
get onto. There's a Goddess Key machine here, and a pillar with a blue light
on top of it. Most likely the SkyKey. Let's take it, and start controlling
the weather! You know what SUCKS, though? The fact that Mote, another of 
Jade's four was lying in ambush for you. So far, that's expected, how could 
you have possibly thought you could take the key without a fight? But he sends
you away! Argh! You're thrust into the Dream World AGAIN.

Here's the World of Nightmare. You'd expect some undead and twisted out 
enemies, but strangely, there aren't any.

Head down the ramp, and walk to the west. Go south, and turn east. Go onto the
ramp and follow the path. Eventually, you'll be brought to a cave. Enter it.

Location: Mare Tower

Items: JadeBW, Trident, Cure, L.Ptn, Smoke, CursedHT, FaceMask
Enemies: Nautulis, Buzzer, D.Flea, M.Flea, Warlock, D.Knight, Bain, Blaze

Go north and down the stairs. Again, go north (skipping the east path) and 
down the stairs. Follow the path, and go down when you can. You should be in
a room with four chests and a hole. Receive Cure, JadeBW, Trident and L.Ptn.
When you take the L.Ptn, the gate will lock, forcing you to go down the hole.

Go up the stairs, and follow the path, then go up the next set. Run to the 
left, and head north. Take the stairs. Follow the path and skip the south
path. Go up the stairs.

Take the three chests to your right. Receive Smoke, CursedHT and FaceMask. The
CursedHT is pretty powerful in terms of defense, but it's incredibly heavy.
Your choice if you want to equip someone. I'd say give it to Ox, since his 
active is always 0 anyway. Once you get them all, head north, go west, head
north again, and you'll reach Mote's Conscience. He'll crush the wall ahead,
allowing you to pass. He'll ask you to beat Mote up whilst he still has 
energy. Go north and up the staircase.

There's two healing springs and a pot. Heal up, and press A against the pot
to summon the Dragon Lord. Save, and head north.

This part is very, very annoying. Without me, I'm sure you'd spend some time
walking the wrong direction. Head straight north, and you'll hit a panel.
Stepping on it will cause the screen to rotate wildly, and screw up your 
direction. Supposedly. Head west. When you hit the next panel, head south and
follow the path. Another panel! Head north when it stops. In front of you
again, is another rotater. Head east, and south when you get the chance. It'll
lead you to a north/south intersection. Take the south, and hit another 
spinner. Go west from here, skipping the south path, and hit the next rotater.
Take the west, and skip the first north path you see. Use the second one, and
follow it until you hit one last rotater. Head west and follow the path, and
finally, you'll be out of here.

There are different methods then the one described here. I'll see if I can 
find a quicker one. Next century...

Alright, from here, you'll reach a west/east intersection, take the east. Go
up the stairs, and head south. The panels take 1HP off a step, but with
LifeAR and LoveBR, it doesn't really matter too much. Anyway...You see the 
torches on the wall beside the yellow tiles? Walk in front of the right one,
and walk south to fall into a trap. Head north and up the stairs, then up the
next set. Head walk around the top of the floor to the next staircase (there 
are some traps taking the lower path, you can just have Karn in the lead to 
avoid). There will be alotta sets of stairs here. Take the lower-right. 

Walk up, and let's take care of Mote!

Mote
HP: 3500
AT: 210
EX: 5400
GP: 6000
Actions: Attack, Inferno(150), Burn Out(All, 90)
===================
His attack does 25-47 damage.
Now, at first sight, you'll be, "What the **** is that thing?" And I'm here to
tell you, "Nine Pixels." No damage will be done in the beginning, but the 
battle will stop for a moment, and restart. At this point you can hurt him, 
but DO NOT use any attack magic, including Dragon spells. Instead, Nina should
Atk-Up everyone, and everyone attacks. As you attack him, more and more pixels
will appear. As he grows more clear, magic attacks will begin to work. Every 
shot of magic will pixelate him slightly. So, just attack and heal until he's 
on his second wind, and then Bleu should cast FireX, or if you have it, BoltX.

Yay! Now that it's spring in Spring, the waterfall's running. If you didn't

the waterfall, and that was the reason we needed to go up the Spyre. Take the
stairs beside the item shop into the water, and walk into the waterfall. One
area will be darker. Go through it.
And so, as we proceed further to our goal, and with only one key left to take,
we go onto...

Well, here we are, Carmen, the second last city of the game. And, the people
here ignore you! OMG, whuzgoinon? They won't move either, and the store owners
won't sell you things! There IS one guy that can move and talk. He'll say that
this is Carmen (since you shouldn't know), and he'll say he left and came back
to find that time stopped here. Then he'll point you to Tock in the east. Wow,
he's probably the most informative guy in the game. Most people only give you
a scrap and you have to piece it together. Anyway, let's take some stuffs 
before we go.

In the inn is a drawer, open it up. Receive RubyRG. Next, go to the windmill
house behind the weapons shop. Upstairs is a barrel. Move it and search the 
ground. Receive W.Ant. DO NOT THROW THIS AWAY. If you do, you are going to 
have to make one of the next quests MUCH LONGER than it needs to be, SO DO NOT
THROW THIS AWAY. Unless, you already have some more W.Ants in your inv or 
bank. If this is the case KEEP ONE AND DON'T DROP IT.

Hopefully, that's enough caps for you. Leave the town, and let's go to Tock.

Items: Life, EvilCN, IcyAR, Cure, G.Tiara, Life2, GuardSH, AgileHT, WolfSkin
Enemies: Buzzer, Wraith, WraithX, Firehead, Widow, DogFishX, D.Rider

From Carmen, head south, and east, past the forest. Keep heading east, 
skipping the ramp going south, and taking the next ramp going up. From there,
head west, then south, and west again. Go up the ramp and through the forests
via Bo or Bo fusion. Then enter the tower.

Here we are, Tock, the brother tower of Tick. You woulda thought the TimeKey
would start here, but no, Tunlan had it for some reason. Head north, and 
you'll this dungeons' quirk: movement panels. Stepping on one results in the
party being moved two spaces of the direction the panel's arrow. Beyond the
sqaure of panels is a healing spring. From there, head south-west and use the
left arrow. You'll phase through the wall. Head north, and follow the path
for a chest. Receive Life. Keep going north and following the road for another
chest. Receive EvilCN. Equip onto Bleu and head back south, until you reach
the left arrow. Take it. From here, go north and ignore the arrows. Eventually
you'll hit a chest. Receive IcyAR. Use the right arrow, and follow the path,
then use the left arrow. Use the next left arrow, and head up the stairs.

Go west from the stairs, and north into a room with a chest. Receive Cure. 
Now go north from the stairs and use the right arrow, and the next right 
arrow. Head to the right, and use the right arrow. Then use the north arrow.
Head all the way to the west, then all the way south, then all the way east.
Go north, and use the left arrow. Go up the stairs.

Right infront of you is a chest. Receive G.Tiara. Use the down arrow, and head
west. Skip the stairs that lead up the platform, and go north when you can.
You should see an accessible left arrow and a chest behind it. Receive Life2.
Use the left arrow now, and you'll be infront of another chest. Receive 
GuardSH. Use the right arrow to get down, head east and onto the platform. Go
up the stairs.

Whoo, arrow mania. I'll guide you best I can. Head to the top of the room, and
walk east. Use the left arrow on the SECOND row. Then use the left arrow 
on the bottom side of the square. Again, use the left arrow below you. Use the
left arrow on the left side, then use the down arrow of the bottom side. 
You'll be at a chest. Receive AgileHT. Take the north arrow on the left side,
and take the next north arrow in front of you. Again circle 'round the top and
take the left arrow on the second row. Take the left arrow on the bottom side,
then take the left below you. Use the right arrow on the bottom side, use the 
right below you, and use the down arrow on the right side. Use the right on 
the right, and left on the north, and you'll be at a chest. Receive WolfSkin.
Use the left on the top side, then use the right on your right. Use the up 
above you, and you'll be at the stairs.

Could you understand that? I'm not really sure. You'll probably get it after
reading the entire thing more then once. Better yet, you can solve it 
yourself. In any case, when you make it up the stairs, walk to the north, and
you'll encounter Cerl again. If you remember, she stole the TimeKey, and now
she can control space and time, which is why Carmen has stopped. However, 
she'll recognize the very informative man. Time and space will screw you over,
and everyone will be thrown out of Tock.

Ryu's been lost! You gain control of him, and now you must battle alone with
him. Ah well, at least he's survivable. Head east, and up the ramp, then go
west, past the forest, and head north, to reach Carmen again.

If you're having trouble surviving, don't hesitate to use your Dragon magic.
I doubt you'll drain all your AP before you reach Carmen. Unless you've been
casting Gold Dragon, or have been running around aimlessly.

When you get back, you'll find that everyone beat you to there. Small cutscene
occurs, and again, we're Tock-bound. Pah, I'd love a convenient warp there.
But nope, gotta walk.

Back again, however, now you don't have items straying you from the path. I'll
assume you know how to get to the top on your own. If not, go up and look and
skip the paths leading to chests.
Cutscene occurs, and the result is a battle. Here we go.

Cerl causes 25-40 damage, a bit more to a fused Karn.
She's a real pushover. Have Ryu attack as Bolt Dragon, Karn attack as Puka,
Nina Atk-Up Karn and herself and attack, and Bleu casting BoltX. The battle
will end automatically when Cerl takes 2000 or more damage.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Being the smart person she is, she'll see she can't win, and use the TimeKey
to age the people of Carmen. This being a powerful threat, the party stops
attacking. And again, you get sucked into the vortex.

This time, you'll have Nina with Ryu. Simply use Nina's Warp spell to get 
back to Carmen, or walk there if you want to build some levels, since this is
a great opportunity with Nina's healing magic. I don't think you need it 
though.

to exist. Scary. Go inside the house above the fountain for a cutscene, and
you'll have to return to the castle Nina and Ryu were thrust at. However, 
you'll need to bring an item with you.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map
Party: Ox, anyone
Items: Fruit
Enemies: The usual

Do you recall where Ryu was thrown the first time space and time ate the 
party? There was a big tree there. If not, go south, east past the forest,
and down the first ramp. Then head west, and you'll see it. With Ox in the 
lead, press A, and he'll punch it, dropping an apple. Take it. Obtain Fruit! 
With this, Cerl will hopefully regain her senses. Now, head to the South 
Castle. Follow the dirt road, and it'll lead you into a bunch of mountains 
with the castle on the path.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: South Castle, Tock, Tunlan (Why bother to separate them?)
Party: Anyone
Items: TmKey
Enemies: None

Go up to the gates, and Cerl will open up the door. Apparently, the castle
reflects her feelings. Anyway, once inside, go up the stairs. Small talking
goes on, and when you get control, take the blue chest. Obtain TmKey! We have
completed our collection! But all is not gnarly! Goda comes, and calls Cerl a
traitor, and ensues a battle. Hey, shouldn't we like, fight him? Peh. The 
party runs, and after a cutscene, you'll conveniently be warped to Tock.

Sweet. Head up the stairs for more cutscenes, and when all is done, you'll be
at Tunlan. You know that Nina clone we saw earlier? You don't? Didn't I tell
you to talk to everyone before? Pah. You all suck. Well, anyway, Nina is here,
but now she's at adulthood like everyone else. Unfortunately, she has amnesia.
If you didn't notice when you entered Tunlan, there's an orange man who points
you to Carmen. Get to Carmen via Warp.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Carmen
Party: Anyone
Items: None
Enemies: None

Well, since everyone here is back to normal, that means the shops are open.

=====
Shops
=====
Inn: 80G

EQUIPMENT
Tri-BW  - 12000G
IcyCW   - 15000G
FlameSD - 20000G
LoyalRP - 25000G
WorldAR - 12000G
PowerHT - 20000G
MystSH  - 20000G
LightCL - 30000G

My god. Look at those prices. The weaponry is pretty good though. Buy whatever
that's better then what you have on now. Don't get the Tri-BW, since Bo's 
gonna get a new weapon soon or an IcyCW either. Do get Ryu a FlameSD, dunno 
why Capcom made the DragonSD so weak. When all is done, visit the house behind
the weaponry.

The old man here is a doctor and has a cure for amnesia. He'll need P.Fish,
Root, C.Nut, and W.Ant. Now, hopefully you still have a W.Ant. If not, WHY THE
HECK DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?! Sigh...The next section is going to add some
more hidden rooms, and it'll tell you where to get the items for the tonic.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: World Map and Hidden Rooms
Party: Ryu, Mogu, Ox, Bleu
Items: P.Fish, C.Nut, Root, HeroBW, WindBR (Possibly the W.Ant, if you were
stupid)
Enemies: Variable

Get Ryu his Rod and bait, and head to where the south castle was. From there,
follow the dirt road, and you'll reach a broken bridge. Have Ryu fish on that
spot, and he'll catch a P.Fish. Don't use this on any of your members, they'll
be poisoned. 

Warp to Tunlan and exit. Have Ox in the lead, and press A against any of 
trees. If you don't get it at first, try again on another tree. A nut will 
fall out eventually. Receive C.Nut

Warp to Gramor and exit. Head to the south, and you should see these weird
plants. One is detached from the group. Go infront of that one, and have Mogu
dig. Receive Root. That should be all the ingredients.

Now, if you were an idiot and somehow managed to throw away three, count 'em,
the THREE W.Ants the game GIVES you, then prepare for a very chancy round.
Have Karn fuse into Shin, and have him at the lead of your party. Go anywhere
(I find Carmen to be the best), and wander and battle. Very rarely, a White
Deer will appear on the world map. Have Shin hunt it down (have a Mrbl3 handy
so it won't disappear because of a random battle), and take it's antler.
Alright, let's go check out another dig spot and anoter gate.

Hidden Room 3:
Get to Carmen. Head south and east past the trees. Ignore all the ramps. Just
keep going east. Eventually, you'll reach a wasteland. Head northwest, and
you should see a dig-spot. DIG! The room will have a warp and a chest(Toxin
trapped). Receive HeroBW. Equip onto Bo.

Hidden Room 3:
Still around Carmen, this time it's a Dragon Gate, so get Karn to use Puka
fusion. Most likely, you'll be at the digspot, so head south from there, and
down the ramp going south. East of there is the gate. Puka call! It opens. 
Enter, and take the chest. Receive WindBR. Now return to Carmen.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Carmen, Tunlan
Party: Anyone
Items: Tonic
Enemies: None

Right, head back to the doctor's house and show him all the ingredients. He'll
take them and create the amnesia remover. Obtain Tonic! With this, Nina will
remember who she is. Yay. Head to Tunlan, pronto! Once you're there, find the
house Nina was in, and after a little cutscene, you have Nina again! The time
warp aged her slightly, so now she has a new status portrait, and she can FLY.
Well, let's go use that ability.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Spring, World Map
Party: Nina, Ryu, anyone
Items: Tri-Rang, DragonAR, DragonSH.
Enemies: Variable

First stop, Agua. Head due north, and you should see a tower. I can't recall
if you can enter it, but if you can, don't. Land and search behind it. Receive
Tri-Rang, a rockin' weapon for Ryu. 

Whoops, hehe, my bad, I forgot to tell you earlier that you could have gotten
the DragonAR. Well, it's not like you needed it, the LifeAR is so much better.
Anyway, warp to Spring, and walk into the river from the stairs beside the 
Item shop. Go northish, and you should see a duck pond. Fish there for the 
DragonAR.

Get to Gramor. From there, head due east, and you'll see a well in the middle
of some mountains. Have Ryu fish there. Receive DragonSH. Yay, our collection
is complete. Now, let's get a Dragon Spell! Have Nina fly north from the well
until the land ends, then head east. You should see a temple on an island in
the middle of a lake. Land, and enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Dragon Temple
Party: Ryu
Items: Melon
Enemies: None

Wow. The other two were shrines, but this is a temple. Which means bigger. And
more threatening. Enter and talk the man there. Heal up if you need using the
healing spring on your left and take the chest on your right. Receive Melon.
Go into the center and talk to the Dragon Lord to begin your training.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Avian
HP: 3000
AT: 270
EX: 1400
GP: 1600
===================
Avian deals 36-55 damage. Can cause slams.
Well, this bird maybe ugly, but god, is he difficult without some 
restoratives. And I'm not talking about Herbs, I'm talking about REAL
restoratives. Things that heal 150+. Better yet, go out and get 5 Mrbl1s and
1-3 cures. Now, to fight him, change into Bolt Dragon and attack with Mrbl1s,
or regular attacks if you didn't want to buy them. Heal when HP gets to 60. He
may cause a slam, so you might want to heal at 90.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

After that battle, you gain the powerful Rudra (Kaiser in the original) 
transformation! Hooray! Now, you CAN go get the most powerful transformation
right now, but first, let's finish up raiding treasures through dirt patches.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Hidden Rooms
Party: Nina, Mogu, Ox, Karn
Items: V.Ptn, S.Ptn, Sash, LoveHT, AgileHT, Life2, L.Ptn, A.Ptn, S.Ptn, 
MystCW, StarSH
Enemies: Variable

Hidden Room 4:
Get to Winlan. From here, fly north, and you should come across an island 
(You'll only see the edge) Land on it, and dig on the dirtpatch. There's a 
chest north of where you land. Receive V.Ptn(Curse trap). There are two weak
walls guarding a chest each, one on each side. Ox smashes the wall and takes
the items. Receive S.Ptn(Fire Trap) and Sash(Boom trap). Heal up at the spring
or just open the chests with Karn.

Hidden Room 5:
The last dig patch. Head to Carmen, and fly east until you hit water. Then
go south for awhile until you see the digspot. It's at the tip of the land.
Dig down, and eight chests are in front of you. Receive: LoveHT, AgileHT, 
Life2, L.Ptn, A.Ptn, S.Ptn, MystCW, and StarSH.

Now then! Let's go get the ultimate power. Do you remember Ease Cave? Waaay
back in Romero? Head there. Now that you have the Gills, you can actually
ENTER the cleansing water. Go down all the way and inside the room. The Dragon
Lord will be waiting for you. Speak to him with Ryu, and gain Agni (Infinity
in the original)! This is, by far, the most cheapest spell in the game. Go 
lookee in the magic section to learn why. With all these side-quests finished,
let's get back to the main quest. Get back to Carmen.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Carmen
Party: Anyone
Items: Pass
Enemies: None

In the north-east corner of town is an orangey-dude that always gives you a 
good tip. Talk to him, and he'll disappear. Search the area he was on. Obtain
Pass! With this, we can enter Scande! Alright, to get to Scande, have Nina
fly east until you reach Tock then go south. You'll see a giant fortress like
place. Land, and enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Scande
Party: Anyone
Items: Herb
Enemies: None

Talk to one of three guards, and then you can pass. Wow, that actually worked.
Moving along, you'll see the base of Scande Tower. To get up, you'll need to
go on the elevator (elevator? Isn't this medieval period?), but when you 
examine the control panel, you'll see the parts are missing. So, for now,
go down the stairs to the residences of Scande. To your left is the Dragon 
Shrine, to your right is the inn. The inn has a drawer. Search it! Receive 
Herb. This far in the game, and we're still getting those, huh? The inn is 
also very expensive (400G). Talk to everyone. The D.Dragon henchmen won't give
you any juicy tidbits, so you'll need to go inside and talk to the commoners.
Eventually, get to the bottom of Scande, and talk to one of the D.Dragons. 
He'll say he let the Mole people go. Enter the room in the far right. The guy 
in here will also drop a nice bit of info. Anyway, that's all we can do for 
now. Be sure to have examined the panel and talked to the guy next to the
tower. Head back to Spring.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Spring, Gant
Party: Anyone
Items: B.Parts, Parts
Enemies: None

Why are we here? Well, if you talked to the man beside the Scande elevator,
he said that someone who liked to climb towers climbed the one in Scande. 
Sounds like a fella we know in Spring, so we best pay him a visit. Enter the
house infront of the Inn, and talk to the man. He'll give you the missing
parts of the Scande elevator, but as of now, they're broken. Obtain B.Parts!
Well, let's get them fixed. I'm sure you all know of some very good people
at that. Warp to Gant.

Go to the Guild leaders house, and up the stairs. Talk to the old lady, and 
she'll wake him up. Talk to the guild leader, and he'll give you a free rest
as he fixs the parts. Obtain Parts! With this, we can use the Scande elevator.
Warp back to Carmen and fly to Scande.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Scande
Party: Anyone
Items: None
Enemies: None

Alright, head to the tower, and press A against the control panel. Then walk
inside and wait. Once it stops, walk inside the next one and wait. Once that
stops, head up into the gates. There will be a man blocking the way. He'll 
tell you to get the D.Hrt, a weapon that can destroy any dragon. Find it in
Tunlan. Dammit, lemme at Zog already! Oif. Head back down, and teleport to
Tunlan.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Tunlan
Party: Anyone
Items: D.Hrt
Enemies: None

From the Dragon Shrine, walk north and into the home between the stairs. Talk
to the girl here. She'll play a Dragon song for you, which nearly destroys 
Ryu. She'll bottle it(how handy) and give it to you. Obtain D.Hrt, the dragon
killer! Since Ryu is hurt, go up the left stairs and into the far left home.
Talk to the girl here, and she'll play a healing song for you. Now, head back
to Scande.
(NOTE - Go out and buy some packs of Cures and packs of Mrbl1s. You should 
have more then enough money to do so)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Scande Tower
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Puka], Bleu
Items: IcyCN, Mrbl1, Glove, PowerHT, Cure
Enemies: Entity, Claw, BowManX, LancerX, Soldier

Well get back up the tower. The man won't be here anymore, so we can pass. 
You're immediately thrown into a crossroads. Take the east path for a healing
spring and head up the stairs. Go to the west for two chests. Receive IcyCN
and Mrbl1. Go back east and head down the stairs. Now head west and south when
you see gold tiles. Don't press it though, it'll lock the gate to the south.
Go west when you hit an intersection, and follow the path north. Skip the
platform and go around from the left. You should see a staircase. Head up 
them.

Immediately head south, ignoring the gold buttons, and go right a bit. Take
the passage north, and you should see two chests in a room. Receive Glove and
PowerHT. From there, head back to the stairs you came from, and go all the
way south. Walk past the table and stools, and you should see a staircase. Go
up.

Simply follow the path north to a staircase, then follow again around the 
floor for another one. The path to the next set of stairs has a chest. Receive
Cure. Again, go up the next set, head straight south and up the last set. 
There's a healing spring here, so use it, and head north, and into the black
door. The next area will have pink tiles. Head north, to encounter none other
then the Dark Emperor Zog himself. As usual, he won't give up easily, and 
transforms for battle.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Zog
HP: 16000
AT: 240
EX: 7000
GO: 7000
Actions: Attack, DragonBreath, Char(All, 180), Gale(All, 130)
===================
You know, Zog made me lose COMPLETE understanding of a fused Karns' defense.
His regular attack does 50ish damage, but when he hit Puka, it did something
among the lines of 750. I have no idea why. DragonBreath is basically an 
attack all technique at half-strength, but it hits a fused Karn for 100ish.
Well, there are two ways to go about this, the boring and slow way, or the
dangerous, fun and fast way. The boring and slow way is to have Ryu use Agni
(Unfuse Karn beforehand) and set it to AUTO then stop to heal if Agni's health
gets low. BOOOORIINNNGG. The second way is much better IMO. Have Ryu change
to Rudra and attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Mrbl1s as Puka, Bleu casting BoltX,
and Nina Atk-Up Karn and herself and keep the party's health above 140. If she
has a free turn, have her attack. You'll be doing beyond two times Agni's 
damage in a single turn (Ryu is hitting 960, Karn is hitting 870-999, Bleu is
hitting 600), so it's faster, but your party is more vulnerable if Nina can't
keep up. I find it odd Capcom made Zog have weakness to EVERY elemental, but 
eh.
(NOTE - You don't necessarily need to use the D.Hrt to win. If you are 
planning to, take note that Ryu will be dropped to 1HP.)
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Hooray, the big baddy is dead. We win! The tiles of the floor begin to detach.
Oh noes! Run! But no, the party stands there, waiting for the tile they're
on to fall. The group'll fall, and you'll see a cutscene. Well, doesn't look
like our job's done. They stole our keys! Though, weren't their only six? How
did she get another from that treasure chest? Hm...Oh, right, you should be
trapped after all that's done. Run straight south into the wall, and a mole
person will pop up to save ya. 

Fall down the hole. When you land, go around north, and head east and south.
Talk to the mole here. You'll trigger another cutscene. Fall down the new hole
and you'll end up back in Scande. Exit through the doorway in the south, and
leave Scande altogether.

Well, Jade said he was going to Agua, so let's go there now. To Agua, 
post-haste!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Agua
Party: Anyone
Items: None
Enemy: Easy guys.

Make your way to the top of the fortress. It should be very fast because of
shortcuts Karn made through the doorways. Eventually, you'll reach the place
where we found our LifeAR and IcyDR. Walk inside the Shrine, and Sara will
have a few words to say. Follow her up, and find Jade. He'll say you're too
late, and that she's already been unleashed. He'll leave via transport. Follow
him!

Well, we're nearing the end of our journey. Let's stop that vile goddess! Here
we go, it's...

Items: PowerAR, Domino, AgileAR, TrapGrd, FlameDR, StoneHT
Enemy: Entity, Ghoul, Zombie, PincherX, Buzzer, Widow, ICU, Nautulis

Alright, from where the warp is, head to left, then north between the two 
platforms. Step on that button, and you'll reveal a set of stairs that lead
onto the platform. Use them, then use the staircase. Head north and follow the
path for a chest. Receive PowerAR. Backtrack to the stairs, and push the 
button close by. The gates will fall down. Head through them and go the west.
Follow the path for another chest. Receive Domino. Backtrack to where the 
gates once were, and head to the east. Use the stairs.

You'll return very closeby where you started. Now, head to the right, and go
north between the two platforms. Press the button for some stairs, and head
onto the platform. Follow the path, and you'll hit a staircase. Go up. From
here, head due east. Take the north road when you hit an intersection. There
lies a chest. Receive AgileAR. Go back to the intersection and head south.
Follow the path. Use the stairs leading down.

Punch the button to the left of you. Use the right path, follow it, and use
the right path again. Go north, and press the button. Keep going for a chest.
Receive TrapGrd. Go back and press the button, then head south. Once you hit
the wall, go west, and head north as soon as you can. Follow the path, press
the button, and go north. Keep going north, and you'll see a chest. Receive
FlameDR. A staircase is closeby. Use it.

Follow the path here, and head up the stairs. Head onto to the platform, and
you'll get a small cutscene of poor dialogue. Heal after you ram into the 
shield. Try to head down the stairs, but Sara'll stop you. Talk to her. Oh no.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Sara
HP: 11250
AT: 320
EX: 8000
GP: 8000
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 55)
===================
Sara will do 56-90 damage.
Well, as with Zog, two strategies are there. Number One: Ryu use Agni, attack
and heal as necessary. Number Two: Ryu use Rudra and Mrbl1s, Nina Atk-Up Karn
and heal and attack, Karn use Mrbl1s, and Bleu use BoltX. However, if you 
still have your D.Hrt song, you can use it here. Instead of only hitting for
the thousands, the D.Hrt will drop Sara's health immediately down to one! One
attack will kill her after the D.Hrt. As with Zog, Sara has a weakness to 
every single element. She has no second wind.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

I swear to god, the next cutscene should have been more touching. WHY IS NOT 
AS TOUCHING AS IT SHOULD BE!? Gragh, I tempted to write a new script and patch
it into the game...Though hell no am I doing THAT anytime soon.

Alright, head down the stairs and straight to the left. Healy spring! Drink,
drink, drink! After that, continue to the west, and follow the path. You'll
hit stairs going down. Right in front of you is a chest. Receive StoneHT. 
Take the staircase to the right. Head south and east, passing by the hole.
Follow the path, and you'll hit a staircase, leading to a new area.

Oif. Two ways to go, I recommend the way where you can see the path. Head 
south, and follow the drunkenly made path, leading you to a hover. Use it, and
go south. Follow the path again, and skip the next hover. You'll be at the 
stairs. Use them. Take the hover, and run north. Cutscene!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Drogen
Party: Nina, anyone
Items: None
Enemies: The very weak ones

(TRIVIAL - Overworld Theme changes back to the first one)
After that, you'll get another cutscene. Jade has resurrected the Obelisk, and
it's up to us to take it down. Currently, you won't be able to enter it, so we
probably shouldn't waste time going there, just yet. Head to Camlon. From 
there, fly due east. You should come across an island with a house on it. The
entry from the beach should also be clogged with jagged rocks. Land, and 
enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: I-Woman Home, W-Man Home
Party: Nina, anyone
Items: List, Herb x2, Wtzit, Note1, Note2, I.Claw
Enemies: None

Prepare for an annoying fetch quest. Talk to the lady here. Exit the house,
and fly due south. You should see the W-Man's Home (Remember the guy who 
tipped you off with the GrimFowl Egg?). Land and enter. Talk to him, and enter
his house. Push the pots aside and take the left-most chest. Receive List. 
There's two chests too. Walk through the bed to pick 'em up. Receive Herb x2.
(Thanks to everyone who sent me a message about that) Exit, and fly back to 
the I-Woman's home. Talk to her, and enter her house. Again, push the urns 
aside and take the chest. Receive Wtzit. Fly back to the W-Man's house, talk 
to him. Receive Note1. Fly back to the I-Womans' home, talk to her. Receive 
Note2. Fly back to the W-Mans' house and talk to him. Obtain I.Claw! With 
this, we can dig through the surface of the Obelisk! Oif, stupid quest. But 
wait! If Mogu couldn't tell what it was, he probably won't know how to use it.
Head to Gramor.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Gramor
Party: Mogu, Anyone
Items: None
Enemies: None

This place is now more alive, as the mole people have been freed. Go to the
eastern most home, and talk with the old mole there. Talk to him with Mogu in 
the lead. Mogu learned how to dig effeciently!

Now. We can go and destroy Jade and his Obelisk. However, I highly recommend
buying packs of Cures and Mrbl1s. And I'm talking about ALOT of packs. 
Say...8-10 packs for each? Well, that's only if you want the final battles to 
be fun and exciting. If you want them to be sucky and easy, only get alot of 
Cures. Also, I highly recommend that Nina should have learned CuraX (Level 37)
because you need it. Go refill your WaterJar as well, if you dried itof it's 
Cleansing Water. If you have the patience, run Gobi's shop at the flea market 
for cheaper supplies, and possibly wait for the best equipment (These come in 
very rarely). Oh yeah, take out all those Life2s in your bank too, because 
they'll come in very handy. When all training and supply buying is done, head
for Scande. You'll see the Obelisk in it's place. Nina must fly into it in 
order to enter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Location: Obelisk
Party: Ryu, Nina, Karn[Puka], Bleu
Items: FlameHR, StarHR, EmporSD
Enemies: BlazeX, Gargoyle, PincherX, Warlock, D.Knight, Golem, Claw, Ruga

This is it. The final dungeon of the game. Prepare for evil bosses. Unless, 
you're planning to blast your way through them with Agni. Nevertheless, change
your lead member to Mogu and open the door. See that crack? Have Mogu stand on
it and press A for him to use his Drill technique. The party'll fall through
the floor, right onto a warp. Won't teleport you though.

From where you land, head east, south (skipping the north path), east, and
follow the path to a hover. Head north, then west all the way, and you'll see
another hover. Use it. You'll be at the stairs. Head down them.

On this level, go north. Take the hover. From here, you can either go for the
path with the FlameHR, or go for the path which leads to the next area. I'll
start with the FlameHR path. Take all the paths that lead up, and when you're
at the top most line, head east for a hover. Use it. From here, it's pretty
straight forward, follow the paths to the next hover, and eventually, you'll
see a chest in the middle of the path. Receive FlameHR. It's pretty useless at
this point of time. Head west, take the hover, and keep going west to be back
at where you started. Go north and take the hover again. Follow the path to
the intersection, and head south-east. You'll see the hover. Again, straight
forward, follow the path, take the next hover, follow the path, and you'll run
into Goda. Follow him for the next hover, and you'll reach a staircase. Head
down them.

Take the hover north of you. And head north again. Goda stops you. Battle!

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Goda
HP: 11000
AT: 235
EX: 6000
GP: 6000
Actions: Attack
===================
Goda hits for 50-90 damage. Hits a fused Karn for ALOT higher.
The first of the final three bosses. And also incredibly easy. Again, it's the
same options: Agni, or no. And again, it's more fun not to use Agni. Ryu use
Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Nina buffing, healing and attacking, Karn use Puka,
attack with Mrbl1s, and Bleu destroying him with BoltX. Do be wary of your HP,
make sure you don't have Nina slacking off. You'll be fine. Goda has no 
variety in abilities, so you'll only see that physical attack. Goda has no 
weakness.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Goda's dead, and that's the end of Jade's Four. It did take longer to kill 
them all then I expected, but whatever, Goda was an idiot anyway. If you don't
want to continue with wounds, or you realize you don't have enough items to
last you, or whatever, go ahead and use Exit. But anyway, after that, walk
through the hole in the wall Goda made. Use the staircase in front of you.

This part, I hated. It was so annoying the first playthrough 'cause I didn't
understand it. Use any hover. Anyone at all. Head down the stairs. It'll all
lead you to the same area. From here, it's pretty straightforward, but I'll
baby you through anyway. Take the hover south-east of where you are. Head 
south past the heart and down the stairs, then go right. Go up the next set
of stairs, and follow the path north for another hover. Ride it west, and then
go south a-ways, down the stairs, and right to the next set of stairs. Go up
and take the hover south. Head south past the heart, down the stairs, and head
to the left. Then north. Go up the stairs, follow the path going south,
and you'll hit another hover. Follow the path, and go down the stairs, head
south, and up the stairs leading to a heart. Head west to the next heart, then
north to the stairs. Go down them.

Take the only hover you see. Head down the stairs. Go north, and you'll see
Jade, whom will chat a bit. Refuse his offer, and prepare for a battle.

! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Jade
HP: 25000
AT: 280
EX: 8000
GP: 8000
Actions: Attack, Attack All, Blizzard(All, 100), Shock!
===================
Jade hits for 70-97 damage. Attack All hits for approximately half-strength.
Jade...what can I say? The same two options lie in front of you. I'm sure you
know them, but just in case you have utter crap of a memory (relax, I do too),
then here they are. Ryu use Agni, attack until below 100HP, then use Cure. OR.
Ryu use Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Puka, attack with Mrbl1s, Bleu
casting BoltX, Nina buffing and healing. Not tough, though he has massive
health, so it'll take awhile. Do be wary, however. According to a reader (I 
have people using this guide, amazing), he can cast Shock!, which has that 
coin toss chance of instantly killing a member of yours. His second wind is 
pretty measly.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Yay! He's dead. But he knows that he wouldn't have beaten you anyway. He knows
it's supposed to be the Goddess's victory. Peh. Idiot. Don't waste my time, 
then. Once he's dead, search the left spot of his throne. Receive EmporSD! The
strongest sword for Ryu. Also, search the back of the right pillar. Receive
StarHR, the second strongest weapon for Ox. Do not equip this, as it will 
serve you much better as an item then a weapon. Now, if you're playing on an 
emulator, save state. If not, you might consider transporting out and save at
a Statue. When all's done, step onto the grey circle on the orange floor. A
hover will zoom by. Step onto it. Now head north, and talk to the girl.

She'll ask if you want a wish. Say yes to be completely healed. Talk to her
again, and say no. You'll engage a battle. Set it to AUTO, and your teammates
will go on to do some massive damage. It'll end after two rounds or so. Talk
to her again. You can't refuse, so say yes. Small cutscene, and battle 
re-engages. Here we go.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
! ! BOSS BATTLE ! !
===================
Goddess
HP: 50000
AT: 350
EX: 10
GO: 12
Actions: Attack, Blizzard(All, 100)
===================
She hits for 66-250 damage, depending on who she hits.
To get the Good Ending: Use Agni, attack once, and battle ends.
To get the Okay Ending: Ryu use Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Mrbl1s as
Puka fusion, Nina buffing and healing, Bleu casting BoltX. Do NOT slack off
with Nina. Make sure that everyone is healthy as can be, because the Goddess
can hurt your characters very badly. If anyone is killed, RenewX or Life2
immediately. It'll be long, but you'll eventually take her down.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

If you didn't use Agni, the ending you see isn't all too great, but it's worth
it for the scene after the credits. Though, I say they should have used art 
instead of a sprite. Gives more mood that way.
If you DID use Agni, then the battle will momentarily stop for Myria to change
into her true form.

                      !  ! F I N A L  B A T T L E  !  !
==============================================================================
                                   GODDESS
                                Health: 50000
                                Attack: 350
                                EXP   : 10
                                Gold  : 12
                  Actions: Breath, SnakeBite, BigCrash(All, 70)
==============================================================================
Breath and SnakeBite will hit for 157-278 damage. She can, and most likely 
will, instantly kill Karn in a fused form.
Did I need to use the new formatting? Nah, but might as well, since the 
Goddess is one frickin' hard boss. If you actually fight her. If you want to
be a n00b and just use Agni, you don't need any help with strategy. Now, for 
the people who actually want to WIN the battle, Ryu should change to Rudra and
attack with Mrbl1s, Nina should be buffing and HEALING (Cannot stress that 
enough), Karn should be using Mrbl1s as Puka, and Bleu should be casting 
BoltX. Simple enough, right? Wrong. Goddess will hit your characters for high 
damage, meaning Nina must be ready to counter the damage with a Cura3, Cura4 
or CuraX IMMEDIATELY. In some cases, a RenewX. If you want her AP to last out,
have her use a Cure instead, though keep in mind she's most likely slower then
the Goddess. You may consider not using Karn, as he will be hit for fatal 
damage most of the time and might not be able to afford refusing time and 
time again. However, the other members will hit for pitful damage. Her 
defenses are THAT high. If Nina is ever struck out, Life2 her at once. When 
Nina or Bleu runs out of AP, that's about midway in the battle. Use the WtrJar
at this point. That oughta freshen' your troops. Continue with the offensive
tactics, and you'll win. You won't realize when you win because by that point,
you'll start thinking the Goddess is invincible, and thus the last attack will
be a pleasant suprise.
(D'oh. I forgot. If you listened to me when I said not to equip the StarHR,
have someone survivable use the StarHR instead of having Karn fusion use 
Mrbl1s. You'll do better damage then you would if you got criticals with Puka)
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=**=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=**=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=**=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

YAY! You WIN! Enjoy the REAL ending. Oh yeah, do you remember when I said that
this would be character developing? I lied. >_>

This part sucks, but will remain for completion's sake.
For GOOD monster info, go look in Novalia Spirit's AWESOME guide instead.
http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/file/563529/51306

Format:
Name - The name of the monster. Duh.
HP: Health of target. How much damage it can take before dying.
AT: Attack Power. Factors in with how much damage it does to you.
EX: Experience. How much EXP points it'll give your party.
GO: Gold. How much money it will drop.
Actions: Abilities of the target. Spells will have the damage in brackets.
Location: Where the monster is found
Drops: What the monster drops.
(NOTE - EXP and GP will vary, no idea why, but the game fluctuates a lot with
them.)
(NOTE - I can only give ONE location, the first time you find it, after that, 
they start to appear in a lot of places, and it makes it very difficult to 
write them all down.)

******************************************************************************
==============================================================================
                                First Chapter
==============================================================================

Frog
HP : 180
AT : 20
EX : 500
GO : 350
Actions : Glob Shot, Tongue Lash, Lunge (All regular attacks, just different
animations). Recover (10HP).
Location: Camlon Castle
============================
GlobShot and TongueLash does 5-8 damage.
Lunge does 8-11 damage.
He's not too tough. At level 5, I got him down to his second wind before even 
healing once. At this point of time, you have no variety in options, so do the
only thing you can do: Attack. If you're slower then he is, heal with an herb
when you're at about 15HP, if you're quicker, heal right before you're going
to die. These are approximations, you never know when he might hit for a high 
damage lunge. Still, he's easy to take down.


Knight
HP : 390
AT : 45
EX : 700
GO : 500
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(20), Recover(40)
Location: Gaia Temple
============================
His physical attack does 8-9 damage (Funny, I thought it was set at 8, until
he struck a 9)
Not that hard, but he gets pretty annoying when he's low on HP because he 
starts to recover. Since it's all you can do, attack non-stop until he drops
your HP to 20 or below. You should heal with an herb when that happens. Also
you can use that F.Stn and B.Stn you picked up early and let them loose for
a pretty hefty blow. He'll fall eventually.

==============================================================================
                                  Second Chapter
==============================================================================

Morte
HP: 120
AT: 65
EX: 280
GO: 200
Actions: Attack
Drops: M.Drop
============================
He does 15-25 damage.
(Technically, a mini-boss, but eh)
Do you hear that? The Grim Reaper's calling! But man, what a wuss. His regular
attacks do hyped up damage to anyone on the front row, but he can barely take
a hit himself. Nina should use the E.Key every turn while the soldiers attack.
5 turns, and this guy is done. If someone gets low HP, have Nina heal and one
of the soldiers use the key.

Mortea
HP: 230
AT: 90
EX: 336
GO: 240
Actions: Attack
Drops: Herb
============================
She does 19-36 damage.
(Technically, a mini-boss, but eh)
Mortea's not happy that you owned her brother, and she'll take her shot at
taking you out. But of course, it's futile. She does have a better AT score 
then Morte by alot, but it doesn't matter much with the E.Key. Do watch your
characters health, though, and be careful to not have anyone die.

Wizard
HP: 180
AT: 40
EX: 1000
GO: 700
Actions: Freeze(15), T.Bolt(10), Petrify
============================
Wow, this is new, an opponent with no physical attacks. Anyway, strike the 
hell out of him with your sword until he uses Petrify. Once he does that,
start using your reliable E.Key. Heal if your HP gets to 30 or below (he's
faster then you are, so best to heal early).

==============================================================================
                                  Third Chapter
==============================================================================

Pog
HP: 280
AT: 80
EX: 1400
GO: 800
Actions: Attack, Double Attack, Flame Breath, Ice Breath
===================
Any attack Pog uses does 8-11 damage.
Pog's not hard. You might need to recover at the start of the battle because
you just came from legions and legions of battles in a Forest of Despair and
against undead guys, but overall, it isn't that bad. He can attack both Nina
and Ryu in the same turn with his Double Attack, but that probably would have
been more vicious if it hit the same member. Anyway, have Ryu attack, Nina use
the E.Key, and you'll win in no time flat.

General
HP: 250
AT: 110
EX: 1120
GO: 300
Actions: Attack
===================
He does 16-24 damage.
I wasn't able to see if he had any other abilities, because I owned him in 
two turns. If you forgot to use them, toss your stones at him and watch as his
health bar magically disappear. Chances are that you have used them, so 
resort to physical attacks with Ryu and Bo, and using the E.Key with Nina. You
can alternatively have Bo blast him with his magic, and have someone restore 
his AP afterwards. It really doesn't matter, the General can cause some heavy 
damage, but he dies too dang fast for it to matter.

Wisp
HP: 730
AT: 90
EX: 1200
GO: 300
Actions: Attack, Attack All
Drops: Herb
===================
Any attack Wisp uses does 10-19 special damage (meaning Bo wearing the WolfHT
will take double damage).
Here we go, an actual boss fight where we have more then just attack as an 
option (well there was Pog and General, but those weren't fun). Have Nina use
Atk-Up on Ryu and Bo, then healing and using the E.Key. Fort will be useless
since all of Wisps' attacks deal special damage. Bo cast Fry until he's
out of AP, then start attacking, and Ryu attacking non-stop. Like Pog, Wisp 
can attack all your members, but it won't matter all too much.

Gremlin
HP: 1200
AT: 140
EX: 1400
GO: 800
Actions: Attack, Attack All
===================
Any attack Gremlin uses does 15-30 damage.
Whoo, just got a load tougher then his previous wussy form. Alright, like the
Wisp, he deals special damage, so Bo will take massive damage if you had his
WolfHT on. Nina should Atk-up Ryu as soon as possible. Ryu should be attacking
continously. Bo should be casting Fry non-stop, and Nina should be healing 
Bo's AP with Acorns and healing the party. If she has a free turn, she should
attack with any stones you may have left and the E.Key. Keep in mind that the
Gremlin is faster than all your characters, so heal ahead of time. If you mess
up, you can still restore a single person's health with Nina's magic, since 
that will always go first. Once he's on his second wind, he will ALWAYS use
attack all, so I highly recommend bringing a supply of meats.

                                The Fourth Chapter
==============================================================================

Talon
HP: 700
AT: 70
EX: 400
GO: 190
Actions: Attack
==================
Talon does 9-15 damage. It can cause a slam for double damage.
As Ryu, you're out of options again. So, let's attack and heal when necessary.
Heal at about 30HP, and attack with the E.Key.

SandWorm
HP: 1600
AT: 180
EX: 1200
GO: 1200
Actions: Attack
===================
Sandworm attacks for 15-25 special damage.
Again, if Bo has his WolfHT on, he'll take quite a bit of damage. However, 
this fight is over really quickly, so I don't think you'll need to switch it 
out. Have Ryu use ThrDr and attack non-stop, Nina Atk-Up herself and Bo, then
attack, and have Bo attack non-stop. Seriously, if Nina can do 50+ on this guy
with an Atk-Up, how tough can he be? (My Nina was kickin' butt with continuous
slam attacks, going upwards to 130+) Heck, you might even consider Atk-Up on 
Ryu and have him attack regularly. SandWorm's defense is THAT pathetic. He'll 
be down and out before you know it.
(NOTE: SNES Version, SandWorm is weak to ice, so use SnoDr and Frost, if 
you're playing that version.)

EyeSpy
HP: 1600
AT: 100
EX: 2800
GO: 2800
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 25)
===================
EyeSpy deals 9-15 damage.
Not hard at all, Ryu should ThrDr and attack, Bo should attack and use Fry
occasionally, and Nina should Atk-Up Bo and use the E.Key. When it's on it's
second wind, it will use nothing but T.Bolt, but at that point, you can wipe 
it out in one turn with ThrDr attack, Bo's Fry spell, and the E.Key.

Cloud
HP: 1400
AT: 120
EX: 4800 
GO: 1200
Actions: T.Bolt(40), Burn Out(40), Devistate(All, 45)
Drops: Herb
===================
Whoo, another no-regular-attacker. Have Nina keep everyone's health above 45,
Atk-Up Bo and Karn, and use the E.Key. Have Ryu use ThrDr and attack non-stop,
Bo Fry until he's out of AP and resort to regular attacks, and Karn attack 
non-stop, since that's all he can do. Cloud will be gone soon enough.

Squid
HP: 1000
AT: 155
EX: 6000
GO: 4200
Actions: Charge, GlobShot, Attack All
===================
Any of his globshot attacks does about 15-50 damage. However, Ryu will take 
considerably less damage because of the super equipment you found in Agua.
This includes damage from his Charge attack. It did 105 to my Bo, but when he
used it on Ryu, it did a measly 11. Used it on Nina, and it caused 28. So, I 
can't really pinpoint the ranges.
Being a water creature, electrical attacks should do very nice damage. Ryu 
should cast ThrDr and attack, Nina should Atk-Up herself and Karn, then resort
to regular attacks, Bo should cast Fry, and Karn should attack. Squid will 
fall before it can do any real damage.

Octo
HP: 1000
AT: 160
EX: 6000
GO: 1500
Actions: Charge, GlobShot
===================
He's so alike with his brother, in the fact that his attacks are only a tiny
bit stronger (If at all), and he's a wuss when it comes to lightning attacks.
He will, however, use his charge attack much more often then his brother did,
so beware.
Anyway, same strategy as before. Ryu use ThrDr and attack like mad, Nina use
Atk-Up on Karn and herself and attack like mad, Bo cast Fry like a mad man, 
and Karn, well, attack like mad. He'll be dead in practically the same time
it took to kill his brother.

==============================================================================
                               The Fifth Chapter
==============================================================================

Morteo
HP: 1500
AT: 180
EX: 3200
GO: 3000
Actions: Attack
===================
He does 34-45 damage, except to Ryu if he is wearing LifeAR
Pathetic. I can't believe I decided to call this a boss fight, but I dunno,
calling him a mini-boss doesn't seem right. Anyway, this cousin of Morte and
Mortea is a wimp. You can really just AUTO the fight, and stop it if someone's
health starts to get low. Heck, Nina will do more the then E.Key when she 
isn't even powered up (though that may be because I bought an EvilRP for her).
If you want, power-up your characters with Atk-Ups to speed up the fight. 
Morteo has a weakness to fire, but you can't really exploit that if Ryu 
powered-up is doing past 172 damage.

Toad
HP: 2300
AT: 330
EX: 6000
GO: 1500
Actions: TongueLash, GlobShot
===================
Okay, no idea why, but he only attacked Nina, and it was for a horendous range
of 84-133. He instantly killed her one time when she was at full HP. Just 
terrible luck for me, I guess.
Anyway, Ryu should ThrDr and attack, Nina should Atk-Up Ox, Karn, and herself,
then start to attack and heal, Karn should attack in Shin form, and Ox should 
attack. And down goes Toad.

GrimFowl
HP: 2000
AT: 170
EX: 4200
GO: 4800
Actions: Burn Out (75)
===================
I couldn't check to see if it had anymore abilities, I killed it in two turns.
The GrimFowl is a fire creature, so Ice magic works well. However, Ryu's
physical attack is more powerful then SnowDR if he has an Atk-Up buff.
Basically, all you need to do is have Nina Atk-Up Karn[Shin], Ryu, and Ox (If
you have enough time), and attack. Down in no time flat.

SlimeX          ->  SlimeX (Fused)
HP: 600             HP: 1200
AT: 20              AT: ??
EX: -               EX: 5400
GO: -               GO: 6000
Actions: Attack     Actions: Attack
===================
SlimeX, fused or not, does 15-41 damage.
Pathetic. They have a weakness for fire, but why bother? Smash around the 
individual SlimeX's with physical attacks from the party, destroying them with
the B.Rang. Once it fuses, keep up the physical attacks, and you win.

==============================================================================
                                The Sixth Chapter
==============================================================================

Myst
HP: 1100
AT: 80
EX: 4000
GO: 3600
Actions: Burn Out (30), T.Bolt (All, 40)
===================
You know, for a new enemy, I was hoping for more. But no, this is what I get.
He uses new a new Burn Out and T.Bolt animation, though they don't compensate
in power. Strategy is simple, ThrDr with Ryu and attack, attack with Ox,
attack with Karn fused as Shin, and Atk-Up everyone (minus Ryu) with Nina. 
Then she just attacks.

Pincher
HP: 1000
AT: 190
EX: 4800
GO: 4800
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 95)
===================
His regular attack does around 38 damage.
He has a weakness for electricity. So, exploit! I recommend having Bo out 
instead of Karn's Shin fusion, so he can cast Fry. So, to put the strategy 
forward: Ryu attack as ThrDr, Nina casting Shield on low HP characters (and
healing if necessary), Bleu casting Fry, and Bo casting Fry. Your attack force
is doing 435 a round, so this sucker will be down in four turns (since Ryu
spends a round transforming). Beware, however, of his Gale spell, it'll wreak
havoc on your party if he decides to use it.

Bain
HP: 1800
AT: 100
EX: 1020
GO: 360
Actions: Attack
===================
Bain deals 13-21 damage, and can (but very rarely) cause slams.
I'm sure that in any other FAQ, you'll find them talking about how cool Bain
looks. I agree. Anyway, since this is a Ryu solo battle, you don't have what
we call "variety" in your abilities. Bain also does not have a weakness. Thus,
all you do is ThrDr and set it to 'AUTO' if you're playing the GBA version.
If you're using the SNES, just keep pressing the A button. Bain will do 
significantly less damage to you in Drake form, so you probably won't even 
need to heal. Heck, if you want, you can take him out without transforming, 
though do pack some form of healing items in your inventory. Bain goes down
easy.

K.Roach
HP: 2800
AT: 100
EX: 460
GO: 200
Actions: Attack
========================
Even though I gave Morte and Mortea a BOSS BATTLE heading, and just made a 
little note of them being Mini-Bosses, there's no way I'm doing that with 
these guys. THEY ARE PATHETIC. Heck, I was attempted to say "FORCED BATTLE".
Karn[Shin] should be doing 999 a hit, or dang near close to there, Ryu should
be at 700+, Ox-ey should be around 600-700+, and Nina is about 450-500. They
each have a second wind, which is annoying, because they're faster then you.
That means, they get three hits, Shin obliterates one's health bar, sending it
to second wind, and restarting the round. They basically get 5 free hits! But
Nina should be able to compensate if they have been focusing on one member. If
not, don't stop attacking for anything.

RugaX
HP: 1400
AT: 170
EX: 3200
GO: 2400
Actions: Bite, OrbShot, Attack All
===================
RugaX does somewhere around 40-60 damage with its attacks.
You know, I'm curious as to why this Ruga is X-ed up, but weaker then the 
original Ruga. In terms of HP and Attack Power, anyway. This one's worth more.
Not much to this, pound it down with physicals. If you want, you could switch
Ox out for Bleu and have her storm away with Chills or F.Balls or Blasts, or
whatever the heck she has in her bag o' tricks at this time. You could also 
have Ryu BltDgn to make him go away all the more quicker. Doesn't really 
matter.

G.Fly
HP: 1000
AT: 170
EX: 5600
GO: 6400
Actions: Attack
Drops: Herb
=======================
It can cause 32-46 damage.
Destroy it with multiple physcial attacks. Or, if you're just pissed off at 
this side-quest, you can BltDgn with Ryu, and Atk-Up all your members to truly
turn this thing to dust.

FlowerX
HP: 2900
AT: 250
EX: 3200
GO: 3000
Actions: Attack, Poison
===================
It only got one regular attack in (it used Poison on two of the three turns it
was alive), and it did 92 damage to Shin. However, Shin seems to take more
damage then everyone else, and if I killed it in three turns and forgot to 
heal ever since coming back from the Lab, I doubt you need to worry.
You know, being a flower, you'd think it'd be weak to fire, what with RPG 
physics and all. But no, it still takes 210 from FirDgn. So, BltDgn attacks 
with Ryu, regular attacks from Ox, regular attacks from Karn fused as Shin, 
and Nina powering up everyone and healing poison wherever.

HornToad
HP: 4000
AT: 195
EX: 6800
GO: 7000
Actions: Squash, Earthquake(All)
===================
He can attack one party member with Squash or use an Earthquake attack (which
isn't a Devistate), each doing 21-52 damage. He'll get an attack increase on
his second wind.
Well, well. I think you should have an idea on how to fight by now. Ryu cast
BltDgn and attack non-stop, Karn attack non-stop fused as Shin, Nina cast 
Atk-Up on herself and Karn, then go on to attacking and healing (She actually
does pretty nice damage to Cort), and Bleu blasting out her Blast Spells, or
whatever her strongest magick is.

==============================================================================
                              The Seventh Chapter
==============================================================================

Mothro
HP: 3500
AT: 210
EX: 6000
GO: 8000
Actions: Poison, Time Out, Shock!
===================
Well, a boss with no physicals. And his other attacks suck pretty bad. Poison
and Paralysis? Get real. However, he'll can also use Shock! the instant kill 
spell that has 50% chance of working. There's really not much you can do 
against that, so just don't let up with attacks. This is the reason I'd 
recommend Ox instead of Nina. Have Ox and Karn[Shin] attacking, Ryu attacking
as Bolt Dragon, and Bleu shooting Chars and Novas and such and such. Ox should
use Heal if someone gets poisoned, but since the super forms aren't affected 
by status ailments, it's only him and Bleu that are at risk. Mothro goes down
without much trouble.

Mote
HP: 3500
AT: 210
EX: 5400
GP: 6000
Actions: Attack, Inferno(150), Burn Out(All, 90)
===================
His attack does 25-47 damage.
Now, at first sight, you'll be, "What the **** is that thing?" And I'm here to
tell you, "Nine Pixels." No damage will be done in the beginning, but the 
battle will stop for a moment, and restart. At this point you can hurt him, 
but DO NOT use any attack magic, including Dragon spells. Instead, Nina should
Atk-Up everyone, and everyone attacks. As you attack him, more and more pixels
will appear. As he grows more clear, magic attacks will begin to work. Every 
shot of magic will pixelate him slightly. So, just attack and heal until he's 
on his second wind, and then Bleu should cast FireX, or if you have it, BoltX.

==============================================================================
                               The Eighth Chapter
==============================================================================

Cerl
HP: 3500
AT: 225
EX: --
GO: --
Actions: Attack, Attack All, Time Out
===================
Cerl causes 25-40 damage, a bit more to a fused Karn.
She's a real pushover. Have Ryu attack as Bolt Dragon, Karn attack as Puka,
Nina Atk-Up Karn and herself and attack, and Bleu casting BoltX. The battle
will end automatically when Cerl takes 2000 or more damage.

Avian
HP: 3000
AT: 270
EX: 1400
GP: 1600
===================
Avian deals 36-55 damage. Can cause slams.
Well, this bird maybe ugly, but god, is he difficult without some 
restoratives. And I'm not talking about Herbs, I'm talking about REAL
restoratives. Things that heal 150+. Better yet, go out and get 5 Mrbl1s and
1-3 cures. Now, to fight him, change into Bolt Dragon and attack with Mrbl1s,
or regular attacks if you didn't want to buy them. Heal when HP gets to 60. He
may cause a slam, so you might want to heal at 90.

Zog
HP: 16000
AT: 240
EX: 7000
GO: 7000
Actions: Attack, DragonBreath, Char(All, 135), Gale(All, 130)
===================
You know, Zog made me lose COMPLETE understanding of a fused Karns' defense.
His regular attack does 50ish damage, but when he hit Puka, it did something
among the lines of 750. I have no idea why. DragonBreath is basically an 
attack all technique at half-strength, but it hits a fused Karn for 100ish.
Well, there are two ways to go about this, the boring and slow way, or the
dangerous, fun and fast way. The boring and slow way is to have Ryu use Agni
(Unfuse Karn beforehand) and set it to AUTO then stop to heal if Agni's health
gets low. BOOOORIINNNGG. The second way is much better IMO. Have Ryu change
to Rudra and attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Mrbl1s as Puka, Bleu casting BoltX,
and Nina Atk-Up Karn and herself and keep the party's health above 140. If she
has a free turn, have her attack. You'll be doing beyond two times Agni's 
damage in a single turn (Ryu is hitting 960, Karn is hitting 870-999, Bleu is
hitting 600), so it's faster, but your party is more vulnerable if Nina can't
keep up. I find it odd Capcom made Zog have weakness to EVERY elemental, but 
eh.
(NOTE - You don't necessarily need to use the D.Hrt to win. If you are 
planning to, take note that Ryu will be dropped to 1HP.)

==============================================================================
                             The Final Chapter
==============================================================================

Sara
HP: 11250
AT: 320
EX: 8000
GP: 8000
Actions: Attack, T.Bolt(All, 55)
===================
Sara will do 56-90 damage.
Well, as with Zog, two strategies are there. Number One: Ryu use Agni, attack
and heal as necessary. Number Two: Ryu use Rudra and Mrbl1s, Nina Atk-Up Karn
and heal and attack, Karn use Mrbl1s, and Bleu use BoltX. However, if you 
still have your D.Hrt song, you can use it here. Instead of only hitting for
the thousands, the D.Hrt will drop Sara's health immediately down to one! One
attack will kill her after the D.Hrt. As with Zog, Sara has a weakness to 
every single element. She has no second wind.

Goda
HP: 11000
AT: 235
EX: 6000
GP: 6000
Actions: Attack
===================
Goda hits for 50-90 damage. Hits a fused Karn for ALOT higher.
The first of the final three bosses. And also incredibly easy. Again, it's the
same options: Agni, or no. And again, it's more fun not to use Agni. Ryu use
Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Nina buffing, healing and attacking, Karn use Puka,
attack with Mrbl1s, and Bleu destroying him with BoltX. Do be wary of your HP,
make sure you don't have Nina slacking off. You'll be fine. Goda has no 
variety in abilities, so you'll only see that physical attack. Goda has no 
weakness.

Jade
HP: 25000
AT: 280
EX: 8000
GP: 8000
Actions: Attack, Attack All, Blizzard(All, 100), Shock!
===================
Jade hits for 70-97 damage. Attack All hits for approximately half-strength.
Jade...what can I say? The same two options lie in front of you. I'm sure you
know them, but just in case you have utter crap of a memory (relax, I do too),
then here they are. Ryu use Agni, attack until below 100HP, then use Cure. OR.
Ryu use Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Puka, attack with Mrbl1s, Bleu
casting BoltX, Nina buffing and healing. Not tough, though he has massive
health, so it'll take awhile. Do be wary, however. According to a reader (I 
have people using this guide, amazing), he can cast Shock!, which has that 
coin toss chance of instantly killing a member of yours. His second wind is 
pretty measly.

Goddess
HP: 50000
AT: 350
EX: 10
GO: 12
Actions: Attack, Blizzard(All, 100)
===================
She hits for 66-250 damage, depending on who she hits.
To get the Good Ending: Use Agni, attack once, and battle ends.
To get the Okay Ending: Ryu use Rudra, attack with Mrbl1s, Karn use Mrbl1s as
Puka fusion, Nina buffing and healing, Bleu casting BoltX. Do NOT slack off
with Nina. Make sure that everyone is healthy as can be, because the Goddess
can hurt your characters very badly. If anyone is killed, RenewX or Life2
immediately. It'll be long, but you'll eventually take her down.

                                   GODDESS
                                Health: 50000
                                Attack: 350
                                EXP   : 10
                                Gold  : 12
                  Actions: Breath, SnakeBite, BigCrash(All, 70)
==============================================================================
Breath and SnakeBite will hit for 157-278 damage. She can, and most likely 
will, instantly kill Karn in a fused form.
Did I need to use the new formatting? Nah, but might as well, since the 
Goddess is one frickin' hard boss. If you actually fight her. If you want to
be a n00b and just use Agni, you don't need any help with strategy. Now, for 
the people who actually want to WIN the battle, Ryu should change to Rudra and
attack with Mrbl1s, Nina should be buffing and HEALING (Cannot stress that 
enough), Karn should be using Mrbl1s as Puka, and Bleu should be casting 
BoltX. Simple enough, right? Wrong. Goddess will hit your characters for high 
damage, meaning Nina must be ready to counter the damage with a Cura3, Cura4 
or CuraX IMMEDIATELY. In some cases, a RenewX. If you want her AP to last out,
have her use a Cure instead, though keep in mind she's most likely slower then
the Goddess. You may consider not using Karn, as he will be hit for fatal 
damage most of the time and might not be able to afford refusing time and 
time again. However, the other members will hit for pitful damage. Her 
defenses are THAT high. If Nina is ever struck out, Life2 her at once. When 
Nina or Bleu runs out of AP, that's about midway in the battle. Use the WtrJar
at this point. That oughta freshen' your troops. Continue with the offensive
tactics, and you'll win. You won't realize when you win because by that point,
you'll start thinking the Goddess is invincible, and thus the last attack will
be a pleasant suprise.
(D'oh. I forgot. If you listened to me when I said not to equip the StarHR,
have someone survivable use the StarHR instead of having Karn fusion use 
Mrbl1s. You'll do better damage then you would if you got criticals with Puka)

******************************************************************************

(The listing of characters is done in no paticular order. The order of spells
is acquisition)

============================
Ryu's Dragon Transformations
============================
Ryu, being from the Dragon Clan, has the ability to change into many different
Dragon forms. However, the Clan had sealed their power, so in order to break 
it, Ryu must pass the tests. Changing will give him a breath attack unique to
each dragon, and heightened defensive ability. Dragon transformation will only
last for the battle's duration. The Dragons are impervious to status ailments,
however, if Ryu is not in good condition, he will be unable to transform. 
Also, the entire party must be healthy and Karn must not be fused in order for
Agni to work.
(NOTE - Dragons also have an individual attack score, but I have no idea what
this is for. Just a pointless stat?)
(NOTE - Rudra IS bolt elemental, I've done thorough testing)

Nina's Restorative Powers
============================
The Wing Clan hates fighting, so it's only natural that they train in 
abilities that heal rather then hurt. Nina had to practice this when she was 
even younger then when you met her. She learns more abilities as she gains 
experience.

============================
Karn's Fusions
============================
Karn is part of an ancient bloodline. The clan was scattered in the Goddess 
War by the Dark Dragons, so any person from this family is a rare find. They
mastered the ability of merging, allowing the fusion of them with other
people. This will create a whole new person with abilities that may even rival
the strength of the dragons. It may give heightened skills out of battle as 
well. Karn, however, cannot learn this on his own, and must be taught by a 
mentor.  This magic, unlike Dragon transformation, will last until Karn 
chooses to revert (Or a storyline event cancels it). 

Revert
Cost: 0AP
Description:
Karn unfuses with the other party members, turning them back into seperate 
people.
Learned: When first fusion is acquired

Shin
Cost: 10AP
Description:
Karn does fusion with Bo and Gobi, creating the master archer, Shin (Shaian
in Japanese). The archer is basically an enhanced Bo, having the skills to 
forest walk and hunt. Shin, however, can hunt much more easily then Bo.
Taught by: Mentor in Gant

Debo
Cost: 15AP
Description:
Karn does fusion with Ox and Gobi, creating the mermaid fighter, Debo. The
fighter has no special field abilities, but battle ability is strengthened
considerably. Debo has a giant drawback of only being available underwater 
(Don't bother transforming underwater and trying to surface, it won't work).
Taught by: Mentor in Gust

Doof
Cost: 25AP
Description:
Karn does fusion with Bo and Ox, creating the ultimate warrior, Doof (Rankuru
in Japanese). Like Bo, he can walk through forests, but will be unable to hunt
and smash walls. However, he is very, very powerful, so heavy objects can be 
pushed aside by him. Doof cannot be used underwater.
Taught by: Mentor in Dig-Patch NE of Camlon.

Puka
Cost: 40AP
Description:
Karn does fusion with Bo, Ox, and Gobi, creating the, uhm, killing machine in
a cute disguise (Hey, you try figuring out what he is), Puka (Jeydo in the
original)! Puka will be unable to do any of the skills his parts had, except 
Karn's thieving (can't hunt or forestwalk, can't smash rocks or walls, can't 
become a big fish), however, he is nearly undefeatable in battle. He has 
massive health and can cause great amounts of damage. Also, sealed gates on 
the world map can be opened by his legendary cry.
Taught by: Mentor in Bleak

============================
Gobi's Summons
============================
Gobi can call upon his fish friends if he is underwater. All spells are able
to attack all opponents, however, he can only use them underwater.

Ebb
Cost: 3AP
Description:
A small school of small green fish attack all enemies.
Damage: 30
Learned: Initially

EbbX
Cost: 5AP
Description:
A large school of small green fish attack all enemies.
Damage: 50
Learned: Initially

Eco
Cost: 8AP
Description:
A small group of dolphins attack all enemies.
Damage: 70
Learned: Level 16

EcoX
Cost: 10AP
Description:
A large group of dolphins attack all enemies.
Damage: 100
Leaned: Level 17

============================
Bo's Side Knowledge
============================
Bo hasn't had complete training in magic, so he can't heal or attack to the
full extent that Bleu and Nina can reach. Heck, he can barely heal altogether.
However, at the time you get him, his attack spells can come pretty handy.

Flare
Cost: 3AP
Description:
Fire LV1. A pillar of flame rises from the ground, burning a single enemy.
Damage: 20 / 30

Spark
Cost: 4AP
Description:
Bolt LV1. A lightning bolt strikes a single target.
Damage: 25 / 37

Cold  
Cost: 5AP
Description:
Ice LV1. A ball of cold freezes one enemy.
Damage: 30 / 45

Flame
Cost: 6AP
Description:
Fire LV2. Three pillars of flame rises from the ground, burning a single 
enemy.
Damage: 40 / 60

Frost
Cost: 9AP
Description:
Ice LV2. A chain of cold freezes one enemy.
Damage: 60 / 90 

Fry
Cost: 10AP
Description:
Thunder LV2. A thick bolt of lightning strikes a single target.
Damage: 80 / 120

Cura
Cost: 3AP
Description:
Recovers 50HP for one ally.

============================
Ox's Emergency Care
============================
Ox has two healing spells that can help Nina out some with the restoring jobs.
I find it to be a useless add-on to Ox, but at least he it shows he isn't a
generic 'big and stupid.' He starts with these spells and learns no more.

Cura3
Cost: 15AP
Description:
Recovers 250HP for one ally.

Heal
Cost: 5AP
Description:
Restores any status ailment but 'stun.'

============================
Mogu's Ability
============================
For completions' sake, Mogu has a single spell, being related to his Mole
peoples.

Dig
Cost: 5AP
Description:
100% chance escaping from battle. Unusable in dungeons. (Well, it's cheaper
then Bleu's Flee)

Section 11 - M I S C - The not-very-important aspects of the game.
******************************************************************************

11a.
~ Gobi's Flea Market ~
The greedy merchant can create his own shop! In both Prima and Tunlan exist a
flea market, which is a noticeably wider building than regular shops. They
both have several shops in them, but one counter is empty. And has torches.

That's the one you go for. Because we all know, torches bring the customers
in (Especially in Prima, since, you know, you're underwater). Stand behind the 
counter in between the torches, and, with Gobi in the lead, press A. Random
people will come in, either to buy inventory items or to try and sell you some
goods. Truth be told, it's crap most of the time, but this is the only way to
get some of the most powerful weapons in the game.

Here's how it works. You set up shop, a guy will come in. He'll either try to
buy something in your inventory (never a story item), or try to sell you 
something. He'll put up a price, and you agree or refuse. If you refuse, the
customer may leave, or compromise on the price (lower if he's selling, higher
if he's buying). Customers will do this twice at maximum. If you don't agree
to the third price, the customer WILL leave. Take note, for rare buys, you
may just want to agree on the first price, as the customer can leave at any
time.

Take note, the items people try to sell you will change at specific points in
the game. Here is a list of what you can get at what times, with a mostly
accurate price range. Generally speaking, the most expensive will show up the
least amount of times.

*This is actually a Life x9. Can't believe they didn't bother fixing it when
they ported it to the GBA...

11b.
~ Hunting with Bo ~
The beastly hunter can kill things! I'm sure you've noticed while travelling
the over world, wild animals will show up randomly. With Bo in the lead, you
can hunt them down and take the spoils for yourselves. They can appear any
time you're on the world map.

Here's how it works. With Bo in the lead, press A. He'll notch up an arrow and
fire it. If it so happens to hit some game, they'll burst and leave an item on
the ground. You need to go pick it up. I highly recommend you carry Mrbl3s
while hunting, as the animals (or worse, the dropped items) will disappear
when a battle is initiated. You can also hold the A button to wait before
firing. Time the release juuuust before the instant they get into the line of
fire.

Take note, Karn's fusion, Shin, is an amped-up Bo. It's much easier to hunt
with him because he notches the arrow quicker and it moves faster to boot. 
There's really no reason to use Bo any more when Shin becomes available.

There's another, highly inefficient way of hunting in which you force the 
animal into a corner. You can do this with any character. Animals run when you
enter their 'flight distance', so to speak. If you position yourself correctly,
you can have one backed into the corner with no place to run, while staying
inside it's flight distance. It'll move franctically, freak out, then die, 
leaving behind its precious goodies. This will NOT work with birds, as they
can fly over things and can't get stuck anywhere. I recommend you stick with 
Bo or Shin, though.

Here's what you can hunt, what they drop, and the effects of their drop for
quick reference.

Boar      : Drops Meat. Restores 70 HP to entire party.
Deer      : Drops Antler. Cures poison.
Bird      : Drops WMeat. Restores 100 HP to entire party.
White Deer: Drops WAnt. Restores 100 AP. <-----RARE

11c.
~ Fishing with Ryu ~
The fated hero loves to fish! But this minigame is not nearly as intricate
as its later incarnations.

Anyway, you have access to Rod#s and bait. The bigger the # in the rod name,
the easier it is to get fish. The bait...I'm not sure about.

Here's how it works. Have Ryu equip a Rod and some bait in his ETC. slots.
With him in the lead, press A facing a fishing spot. Ryu will automatically
begin fishing. The chance of success depends on your Rod and (possibly) your
bait. What fish you catch is determined by chance (again, possibly bait as
well). Every time you try to fish, bait is randomly used up. It does not
matter if the catch got away. This means you can potentially catch dozens
of fish with only use of one bait.

You can also get the Dragon equipment by fishing in specific wells with the 
Rod5. That's probably the only important thing to fish for. The locations
are covered in the walkthrough.

Fishing Spots
---
You'll notice these places because a jagged rock sticks out of the water,
and there are the shadows of fish in the water. The same fish show up in
every area, barring Scande. All fish can be caught, except for the following:
Mackrl, P.Fsh (except at Scande), Puffer

South of Drogen - It's right there. >_>

South of Camlon - From Nanai, head south and stick to the west edge.

East of Camlon - From Nanai, head east past the crescent lake and you'll see
the peninsula with the spot.

East of Tantar - From Tuntar, follow the dirt road. Go down the second ramp
you see, and you'll be at the fishing spot.

North of Gramor - Going north and heading east at the mountain range, you'll
see a lake with a peninsula toward the center. The fishing spot is in the 
middle of the lake.

North of Scande (Only gives P.Fsh) - There's a half finished bridge just
north of Scande. Fish on that.

Section 12 - F A Q - The neglected section
******************************************************************************

Q) WHOA! Why is this guide so huge?
A) I like to be in-depth, however, doing the information for equipment and 
spells vertically increases the file size more then doing it sideways. But 
since I suck at chart making without formatting options, this is what we get.

Q) Is that way the scroll block is non-existant?
A) Yes, I believe so. Apologies to any 56k'ers, if it took long to load.

Q) This part of the guide is confusing.
A) "Tough break," I'd say. Or, I'd LIKE to say. But since I'm too nice, I'll
rewrite whatever over there just for you (and to stop any potential e-mails 
about that certain section). Though, I'm not going to give you credits for 
that.

Q) Hey, can you give me the ROM?
A) No, screw you. (Psst...It's not that hard to find >.>)

Q) Why does it feel like this thing is written by five different people?
A) I tend to write differently as according to how I feel. So really, it 
varies alot with the slang and crummy jokes. 

Q) I've got a set of information / there's an error in your guide, can I send
it in?
A) YES! By all means, help me out with anything! I'd certainly love to see a
Gobi's Flea Market guide in here, and I really don't want to mislead anybody.

Q) What the hell is the purpose of that M.Def stat, if all magic damage is 
preset?
A) I wondered about this myself for a while. The thing about M.Def is that it
ONLY kicks in when your character selected 'DEFEND' on their turn. Lame, isn't
it?

Q) I've noticed that the enemies magic attacks don't do the damage you said
they did in your monster list, did you make a mistake?
A) No, my scores should be accurate. The reason your damage is different is 
because of the armour your characters are equipped with. They'll give 
elemental protection, that doesn't require the person to use 'DEFEND' on their
turn to activate. However, I still might have made an error because I wear
protective gears as well. Notify me if it really is a mistake.

Q) What's the difference between GBA and SNES?
A) Difficulty was toned down in GBA, GBA also uses a brighter colour
scheme and a different layout for menus. Artwork was also changed and added.
The script is 100% identical, though (Capcom had a chance to do everything 
right...and they didn't. >_>).

Q) <Insert Flame/Spam/Idiot comment>
A) <Insert cleverly hidden insult>

Flamefury, me, the writer of this guide.  Therefore, the one to blame for this
mess. If you need any RELEVANT assistance, contact me at 
some_guy_unknown2u(at)hotmail(dot)com (yes, this is my real e-mail).

Scott Clemmons, for the monster information I was unable to find.

Capcom, for creating this RPG series. Think of what you might have done when
you were playing this game.  Think!

Dragon-Tear.net, for the statistics of the characters.
The admin there, for telling me about the herbs in W-Man Home.

Pauline Lebaron, for also telling me about the herbs, and the Tri-Rang at 
Pagoda.

Greer Forrester, for ALSO telling me about the herbs, and knocking my 
formatting (which I haven't actually changed properly yet).

Ray Zhao, for telling me about possible weapons obtainable in Gobi's Shop.
Very, very helpful man.

Eliza Hill, for telling me that Jade can use Rub. Very strange that he didn't
cast it once on me, but shot her with it four times.

Owl, for telling me about the SteelBW in Agua.

Justin Wong, for ALSO telling me about the SteelBW in Agua, as well as the 
hidden items in Nabal.

Frodo Squall, for telling me about the L.Ptn in Romero.

Dave, for telling me about the EarthRB in Gust and the Slab I forgot about.

Jesse Theiss, because without him, this guide would be left un-updated for
more years.

And that's all, folks.  Thank you for reading, as I would not write this if it
were not for the people who do not want to think as they play.
