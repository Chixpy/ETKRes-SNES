Breath of Fire Walkthrough V 1.0

Written by: David Callander

Now that I can say that I've fully completed my Final Fantasy 2
walkthrough I've decided to write this walkthrough for another of my
favorite Snes RPGs Breath of Fire. While this game lacks the graphics
of such RPGs of the time like Final Fantasy 3 or Secret of Mana, and
even Final Fantasy 2, its a nice change from the traditional RPG that
was set with the Snes and FF2. While Square didn't originally make
Breath of Fire (Capcom did that), they did do the English translation
of it over here in the US. After playing Breath of Fire II, I'm glad 
that Capcom didn't do the BOF translation. In BOF there are only a few
minor typos in the translation which is good compared to the many done
in BOF2. Now I don't mean any disrespect to Capcom, while they did
make a totally original RPG system with the use of icon menus, this
does make the game easier to learn and play unlike the Final Fantasy
games, I do believe that they should stick to their main strength
which would be the fighting games, or perhaps the MegaMan games which
they have done well with. Their experience with RPGs was non-existent,
and that's why I believe the translations were so rough and hard to
keep up with. None the less, I enjoy playing both Breath of Fire and
Breath of Fire II, and my thanks go out to Capcom for making these two
games. Another thing I found rather weak about the first BOF game
anyway, was that a lot of the monsters didn't look so tough and mean,
and some look like they couldn't even hurt a fly. I don't know if that
was done on purpose, but the game turned out OK.

One a side note about this walkthrough, since you can have up to eight
party members at any given time, you can only have four in your group
at once. This can make for some rather radically changes in the way
that the game can be done in. While the game is linear (can only be
completed by doing things in order), having a different party set-up
makes for more options, more notable while in a battle with the
bosses. I'll try to do the walkthrough with every member in the party
at a different time, and hopefully it won't take me that long to do it.
Like my Final Fantasy 2 walkthrough, I'll be playing through the
game with a trusty notebook full of paper and a pen close at hand to
write it all down. If you notice that this looks similar to the format
of the FF2 walkthrough, it is because I used the same layout, because
its  easier to go with one I can use for reference, rather than
creating a whole new one for another game.

Just a curious note, while finishing up this Walkthrough I was in
Obelisk getting ready to fight Jade and Tyr. For some reason or
another I was fighting a PincherX, and Nina was hit with Zombie. Now
that usually lowers your Attack and Defense, but for some reason
before Zombie her Attack was 141 and Defense was 317. After Zombie,
her Attack was 282, and her Defense was 10. Has anyone else out there
ever seen that happen or is it just a bug in the game? Oh BTW if you
ever had a strange happening in the game and don't know the cause of
it, please send me an E-Mail, because I'd like to see if I can't get a
section going someday in this walkthrough about strange bugs or
something like that.

As usual if you have questions or comments feel free to email me at
Cal_96@hotmail.com. My access to the net has been rather short the
past few months, so please allow me a little longer in getting back to
you about your questions or what not. I can also be reached online at
AIM SN: Caldor2k2 so if you can catch me there, I can answer your
questions faster.

Now its time for the good old copyright notice again. You are free to
use this walkthrough for help on the game, and please feel free to
post it on a web site, as long as the walkthrough remains in tact and
is unaltered. I would hate to see my hard work go to a waste by
someone trying to reword it and change the format and call it their
own. If you do use this on a web site, please send me an Email letting
me know that you want to use it.

Revision History:

Version 1.0 Updated (9-29-07)

This version is pretty much the same as the one I updated back in '05.
I fixed a couple stupid spelling errors, and hopefully fixed that ascii
map of Prima. Not mentioned that I started in the last update was
Gobi's shop items, along with adding into the Monster list where each
monster could be found, along with elemental weaknesses. There is also
a start to the Weapon list, indicating what spell if any it uses. The
updating process stalled because of the Flea Market stuff and trying
to level to 99 to create an EXP chart, but you can still use this
walkthrough to play the game start to finish.

Version 1.0 (11-09-05)

I redid the format a bit to make it look cleaner and with any luck not
harder to read through. I also added in some cheesy ascii art showing
off the menus sort of and gave a brief rundown on what they all mean
to help those who never played the game before. The fact that I am
even working on this anymore I can't even explain after someone took
it upon themselves to add some stuff to this walkthrough and then
managed to get it uploaded at GameFaqs.com. Well anyway that is all in
the past and a dead issue as far as I'm concerned but I filtered out
this bogus stuff and got the guide back to only what I added to it. I
am also adding in some stuff which I happened to have forgotten the
first time around.

Version .10 (5-16-01)

This is the initial release of the walkthrough, and it was a completed
walkthrough when first uploaded so there is nothing special to talk
about here.

I'll try to divide this walkthrough into sections which will hopefully
look like this once I'm finished:

Section I:    Basic Functions
Section II:   Characters
Section III:  Walkthrough
Section IV:   Item List
Section V:    Weapon List*
Section VI:   Armor List
Section VII:  Ect. List*
Section VIII: Magic List
Section IX:   Monster List**
Section X:    Quick Level Points
Section XI:   Gobi's Shop List***
Section XII:  Credits

*: I am trying to update the affects that these give should they have
any that can be easily determined. Like the two notes below this one,
this section is a work in progress and will take time to get it
completely finished.

**: Just a small note on this. While the walkthrough is 100% finished
so you can use it to go from through the game. I am in the process of
playing through the game again right now to try to finish getting the
information on the monsters so I can have a complete list when
finished.

***: Just like the monster list, I am trying to make this section as
complete as possible. However this part remains the same until certain
points are reached in the game. Thus spending an hour after every event
in the story to ensure that I get the earliest and latest you can get
items here is a bit time consuming and may take longer to update.

Once I'm done with the better portion of the walkthrough, I'll see if I
can't find anything else that I might have missed and will need to put
in.

Section I: Basic Functions

Breath of Fire offers you the chance to configure the controls to which
your controls to which you would find easier to use. The default
setting is A used for confirm, and B used for cancel. This leaves you
able to set Y, X, L, and R for whatever you want, which includes
shortcuts to the menu, magic screen, equipment, etc. The other two
preset buttons is start, which brings up the menu, which will show
your current party and their stats, along with how much gold you have
earned. The select button will bring up the map (once you have the map
item) and it only shows which the world where you have explored. Well I
think that just about covers the configuration of the game. Next comes
menu explanation. Breath of Fire unlike most other RPGs of the time,
uses icons for the menus instead of text. Most of these are pretty self
explanatory, but I'll see what I can do about it. First up comes the
menu while on the world. You'll see several boxes at the top which
looks something like this:

 =====================================================================
|                                                                     |
|  ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----       |
| | #1 |  | #2 |  | #3 |  | #4 |  | #5 |  | #6 |  | #7 |  | #8 |      |  
| |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |      |
|  ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----       |
|                                                                     |
 =====================================================================

Now since the text wouldn't all fit, I'll just break down what each one
stands for.

#1-This icon looks like a bag and it is where you can use your items,
and you can also rearrange them.

#2-This icon looks like a helmet, and this is where you go to equip
your weapons and armors which you have bought or found through your
adventure. Only the items highlighted can be used, and there are no
other menus for you to mess with here.

#3-This icon looks like a magic staff, and it is where you go to cast
magics. The only types of magics which work outside of battle are
curative spells and Karn's morph spells, and will appear in a bright
white color if they can be used.

#4-This icon has the letters ST on it. This is where you can go to view
the status of your characters, as well as what he or she is currently
equipped with. Hitting confirm (I shall call this A from now on), will
bring up a listing of that characters spells.

#5-This icon has two arrows pointing up and down. This will allow you
to move your characters to either the front or the back row. When
going here, if the picture of the character is at the top of the
screen, they are in the front row, and if they are at the bottom of
the screen, they are in the back row.

#6-This icon has two arrows pointing left and right. This is the switch
command, and it will allow you to change the order of your characters,
or replace them all together with someone else. Hit A on the character
you wish to change, and then select the character you wish to replace
them with, and hit A again to make the switch.

#7-This icon has the letters OP on it. This is the options menu, where
you can reconfigure your controls among a couple other things if you
didn't do so at the start of the game.

#8-This icon has the word End on it. If you select this one, it will
kick you out of the main menu completely. Hitting start at any time
will also kick you out of the menu as well.

Now lets get to the couple of the sub menus. The first one up is the
item menu. When you go to your item menu, you'll see a screen like
this one:

=========================================
|  ----   |  ----   ----   ----   ----   |
| | #1 |  | | #2 | | #3 | | #4 | | #5 |  |
| |    |  | |    | |    | |    | |    |  |
|  ----   |  ----   ----   ----   ----   |
==========================================

Now this is what each of these new icons stand for.

#1-This is just the bag icon from the main menu, to show you that you
are currently in the item menu.

#2-This icon looks like a hand above a little red dot. This is the use
item icon, and when you confirm on it, you will be brought down below
to your list of items. Select the item which you want to use, and if
its a curative item, the party screen will come up. Simply select the
character you wish to use it on and hit A, and the item will be used.
If the item is grayed out, it cannot be used.

#3-This icon looks like a question mark. This is what I like to call
the help option. Simply choose it, then find which item you want more
information about, and hit A on it, and a detailed screen will come up
and tell something about the item.

#4-This icon has two arrows on it pointing left and right. This is the
rearrange option for items. Much like changing party members, find the
first item which you want to move, and hit A on it, then highlight the
next item you wish to replace it with, and then hit A again to confirm
the move. Useful for keeping items that you can use in battle such as
the E.Key in an easy to reach place, and other items such as the Icicle
which you can never use but need to have at all times down at the
bottom of the list.

#5-This icon looks like a trashcan. As you have probably guessed, this
is the discard item icon. If you are running out of space and don't
want to run back to town to sell some stuff, simply throw it out.
Select the item you wish to discard and hit A, and you will be asked
whether you want to throw the item away or not. If you change your
mind select no, otherwise select yes to confirm the discard.

Now that is all to do with menus and the sub menus which have icons to
deal with on the map, so next I'll explain what you can find in the
shops. When you enter a shop this is what you'll see:

=======================================================================

|  ----   ----   ----   ----    ----                                  |

|                                                      ------------   |
|  -------------                                                      |

|                                                                     |
=======================================================================

Now just a quick break down of what these mean. First I'll start with
the regular ones. The amount of gold your party currently has is in
the upper right corner marked as xxxxxxG or if you have 100, it would
show as 100G there. Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3 just shows the current
goods the shop has to sell, as well as how much they cost. The party
members face pics are shown to the right of the screen. If you are
dealing with weapons and armor, if their icon is dark, then he or she
cannot equip the selected item. Ok now on the explanation of what
the icons stand for.

#1-This icon has the word Buy on it. This is where you buy the selected
item, weapon, or armor. It will place it in your inventory, so you must
go there to use it, and if its a weapon or armor, go to the equip menu
to equip it. Remember buying new weapons and armor is pointless if you
don't equip them after.

#2-This icon looks like I don't know a pair of weights or something.
This is the switch equipment or trade in menu (weapon and armor only),
where you can sell what you currently have equipped and to buy and
automatically equip the selected piece of equipment. The main part
you want to pay attention to is this XX(current stats)->XX(new stats).
This is how your stats will change after you trade in your equipment.
Say you had a BronzSD, and wanted to trade in for a Sabre, then it
could look something like (well mine does as I write this), 44->40.
This means that after the trade in my attack power will be less than it
is now.

#3-This icon looks like a dollar sign. This is the sell menu where you
can sell off all the old items which you don't need anymore, or if you
have too many which are taking up your inventory room. Be sure that
what you are selling isn't needed anymore as some items you cannot buy
again once you sell them. Do note that some items which are important
to the game cannot be sold.

#4-This icon looks like a question mark. It works just like the help
menu in the main menu. Simply select the item you want more information
about, and it will bring it up, and tell what it does, or give its
stats if its a piece of equipment. This could provide what you are
looking for when trying to decide what to buy when upgrading your
weapons and armor.

#5-This icon has the word End wrote on it. When you are done buying
what you need to buy, simple go here to get out of the shop.

Another place where you can run into some menus is the bank. Now there
are only two of them and they are nearly identical, so I'll not waste
more space drawing up what you'll see but when you first talk to the
person at the bank, you'll see two icons, one with the item bag icon,
the other with GP on it. The bag icon will let you store items, and the
GP will allow you to store GP. The max amount of GP you can carry, and
store at the bank is 999999. Now if you are wiped out in battle, you
will lose half your GP. So it may be a wise idea to keep it stored in
the bank if you travel around a lot to test the water so to speak. If
you are wiped out, then you have lost nothing and can simply take the
gold out when you need to upgrade. Both icons are the same in the sub
menu. The one with the treasure box closed and a down arrow is where
you go to deposit items or gold, and the treasure box open with the up
arrow is where you go to withdraw items or gold. That about covers all
there is on banks.

Next up comes the group of menus that appear while fighting. When you
get attacked you'll find a menu that looks something like this:

========================================================
|         |                                            |
|  ----   |  ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   |
| | #1 |  | | #2 | | #3 | | #4 | | #5 | | #6 | | #7 |  |
| |    |  | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    |  |
|  ----   |  ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   |
========================================================

And now just a quick breakdown on the icons.

#1-This is just the stats of the character who you are currently
selecting an action for. Since Breath of Fire is turned based, you can
take as much time as needed to select a course of action for each
character to take.

#2-This icon looks like a sword. This is the main attack menu, and it
has a couple sub menus within it. I will explain them in a moment after
going through all the other menu icons first.

#3-This icon has the letters AB on it. This stands for Auto Battle, in
which case the battles will run automatically. Great for killing off
groups of enemies which you know you can win against. A word of
caution about AB. The AI which controls auto battle isn't what I would
call smart, and thus the entire fight will be fought with weapons
only. Your party will not heal at any time, so be sure you know what
you are facing before engaging in auto battle. If you need to stop the
battle, simple press B at any time, and it will end after all party
members and monsters have made their attacks.

#4-This icon has the word Run on it. This is what you would use if the
battle is going badly and you want to try to flee before things get too
bad. You can only flee from the start, and if your one attempt fails,
you will have to wait until your next turn to try again. For 100%
success with flee, use the flee magic spell, Mogu's dig spell, or the
smoke items. You cannot flee from bosses so don't even waste a turn
trying.

#5-This icon has the letters ST on it. All this does is shows the
current status of the selected character much as it would in the main
menu area.

#6-This is the row change menu, as indicated by the two arrows pointing
up and down. Here you can change whether or not your character will be
fighting in the front or back row. I'm not sure on this, but I believe
that front row is maximum damage to the enemy, while taking full damage
from physical attacks as well. Back row means less damage to the enemy
from your physical attacks, while taking less damage in return.

#7-This is the character switch icon. You can only use this if you have
more than 4 characters in your party. To use it simply select which
character you want taken out of your party, and choose the one you
wish to put in their place. Do try to use caution when switching, as
once you have confirmed the switch, you will not be able to make
another switch until the next turn of the battle starts, and sometimes
this can make all the difference.

Next up comes a couple of quick explanations on the sub menus. When you
choose fight, you will have a couple new icons to use. The first one
is the standard attack, and it looks like a sword in a sheath. Select
this and then chose which enemy to target, or in the case of the rang
weapons, all enemies will be targeted. Next to that comes defend, which
is indicated by a shield. This will place you in the back row of the
battle for the turn. You will lose your attack for that turn, but the
damage you take will be reduced. The next icon on the list is magic.
Here you can cast spells to harm your enemies or heal your allies.
This will not be available to all characters until certain conditions
are met. Some spells cannot be cast in battle, and they will be grayed
out if they cannot be used. Finally comes the item icon. Here you can
use items to heal, or in some cases attack the enemy. You can also sort
them out, or throw them away if needed. Please look above for the
explanation on how the item menu works if you need more help.

Now I believe that is all there is on how the basics of the game work,
so lets get onto more important details of the game.

Section II: Characters

In Breath of Fire, there are eight main characters you can use once you
proceed far enough into the game. Each character has their own
strengths and weaknesses, which makes it important to use each
character enough to learn what they can or can't do. You will need to
use every character at least one time, well at least on the map
leading the party for them to use their special abilities, eg Karn
picking a lock, or Ox hitting the trees on the map etc. Here is a
basic rundown on each character.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hero: The hero like most other RPGs has the highest offense and
defensive abilities in the game. He can equip the best weapons and
armor in the game, while his strength and vigor are what makes him so
strong. There are other characters that gain more HP per level than
the Hero, but his high HP means he can withstand most of the physical
attacks from the front. Later in the game when he gains the dragon
spells, this is when the hero can really do his damage. The first
three spells only hit one monster at a time, and would best be used
against bosses. The later dragons hit all monsters, and do more
damage, but again should only be used on bosses unless your party is
being routed badly. The Hero's disadvantage is that he often gains his
levels the slowest, thus hampering his abilities from growing later in
the game when it starts taking him forever to level. The Hero is best
suited to be first or second in the party, and should be there at all
times.

Starting Stats:
Level: 1 HP: 20 AP: 0 Strength: 10 Vigor: 10 Agility: 8 Wisdom: 12
Luck: 12
Weapon: Dirk
Shield: WoodSH
Armor: Robe
Helmet: StrawHT
Spells: None

Map Ability: Fishing
Here the Hero can fish for Fish, you can see them swimming in small
pools on the map, sometimes it takes a good eye to see them. This is a
vital ability, for you have to fish for all the Dragon equipment later
in the game, but you need the Rod5 for that. Fishing for fish can also
be semi-beneficial, because some of the fish can sell for good gold.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nina: Is it just me or are the magic users in all RPGs weak?? To call
Nina weak is an understatement. Nina's physical attacks are next to
nothing, so it would be best to find someone else to replace her with,
when the battles require a lot of physical combat. Nina is best suited
using items in combat like F. Stones or C. Stones, or the E. Key while
you have it at the start of the game. Nina's strength lies in her wide
selection of spells. She has all the healing magics in the game, and
it would take quite a few items to equal what she can do for you. Nina
has a few attack magics, Zom1 and Zom2, but these only affect zombies.
She also has enhancement magics like ATK-UP which can help early on.
While you have to keep Nina in your party until you get enough members
to switch with, she can prove to be extremely useful, despite her weak
physical attacks. She is best suited to be at the back of the party at
all times.

Starting Stats:
Level: 5 HP: 36 AP: 45 Strength: 10 Vigor: 24 Agility: 35 Wisdom: 38
Luck: 30
Weapon: ShortRP
Shield: None
Armor: Dress
Helmet: None
Spells: Cura, Fort, Heal

Map Ability: Flying
Nina can't use this ability until the very end of the game, but then
again the end of the game is in areas not accessible by walking.
Flying also enables you to get the rest of the Dragon equipment, and
saves time going from one place to the next.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bo: Bo is an all round character that usually has a place in any party
formation. His attacks aren't quite as good as the Hero's but the long
range bows allow him to attack from behind the front lines but not
take the damage. This is a good advantage, since Bo's defense isn't
quite the best, due to the fact that all but two of his bows require
two hands to use, eliminating the use of a shield. Bow has a few minor
spells at his disposal, the most powerful of which is Fry, capable of
doing 80 points of damage to a single monster, (probably 120 or so to
a monster weak to a lightning attack) but his low AP will keep him
from using it very often unless you stuff him full of acorns. This
will help out in boss fights where physical attacks cause very little
damage. Bo is a good member to have around, and while he leads in the
field, he can shoot arrows at animals plus he is also able to walk
through woods on the map, allowing for access to areas that weren't
reachable before.

Starting Stats:
Level: 9 HP: 68 AP: 21 Strength: 40 Vigor: 40 Agility: 42 Wisdom: 33
Luck: 9
Weapon: BronzBW
Shield: None
Armor: Armpad
Helmet: SuedeHT
Spells: Flare, Spark, Cold, Fry, Flame, Frost, Cura

Map Ability: Hunting
Bo can hunt creatures that you see walking around the map after
battles. All of them leave items such as Meats, that heal your party.
Hunting can be a good way to earn money if you can kill a white deer
and sell its antler for 1500 GP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Karn: Karn is the typical thief type character, with a medium attack
rating, high agility and a bad defense rating. Karn will gain the
Fusion spells later in the game, which allows him to join with two or
three other party members, changing his appearance, and greatly
increasing his HP, Attack and Defense. This ability makes Karn a must
have in your party once he gains these spells, but if you need to have
a party member for a field ability, you'll have to unmorph Karn, then
use the specific party members abilities, and then remorph, costing
valuable AP in the process. Unmorphed Karn is of little use, except
for the ability to pick locks and disarm traps on chests. All and all
Karn isn't a bad character to have, just keep him back in the line
until he learns how to Morph.

Starting Stats:

Luck: 51
Weapon: ThrowDR
Shield: None
Armor: SuedeGN
Helmet: NiceHT
Spells: None

Map Ability: Lock Picking/Hunting/Howling
Karn can pick locks on doors while he leads the party, and if you come
across a hole in the floor he will stop your party from falling in,
(but you can still fall in if you walk to it again) and he can disarm
traps on chests, some of which can be nasty later on. When he is
morphed into Shin, he can hunt much like Bo, only the arrows travel
much faster. Doof can move large dresser like objects around, and Puka
can how can I say this other than howling, which will open the stone
walls that look like there is a dragon symbol on it. I don't use Debo
much so I don't know what it does if anything.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gobi: Gobi isn't personally one of my favorite characters, but you have
to use him after your ship sinks from Auria. All of his stats are
medium at best, with a slightly better attack. His spells can only be
used underwater, but they pack a punch for a cheap amount of AP as
compared to some of the other high AP using spells. Gobi isn't much
use on land, so its probably best to use him while you are underwater
to get the most out of him. His slamming attacks can be nasty, but he
only gets them rarely, unless you use a Mrbl1 to induce a critical
hit, so you can use him later if you get them. In Prima and Tunlan,
there is an empty shop that Gobi can use, to sell items and buy rare
items from the people who visit his shop. It can take a long time to
get anything good, but the wait can be worth it.

Starting Stats:
Level: 15 HP: 90 AP: 48 Strength: 35 Vigor: 40 Agility: 32 Wisdom: 49
Luck: 69
Weapon: Pole
Shield: None
Armor: BronzAR
Helmet: BronzHT
Spells: Ebb, EbbX

Map Ability: Big Fish
After you save Prima from the Dark Dragons, Gobi will get the sphere,
which allows a member of the Fish clan to turn into a big fish. You
need the sphere to advance any further into the game. It can't be
missed, unless you walk out of the building without getting it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ox: Ox is another typical RPG character, a big mean character with a
high attack and good defense but slower than a snail. **This just
might be my imagination, but while Ox has good weapons to use and a
high STR rating, his attacks don't do as much damage as the numbers
would indicate.** Ox has no agility at all, (he'll have some only if
you want to spend the time getting him to level 50 or so) making him
the last to attack all the time. His attacks are quite strong, and he
gets the highest HP of all the characters. He only has the use of two
spells Cura3 and heal, but I guess its better than nothing, after all a
little self preservation spells never hurt anyone. Ox is strong enough
to be placed first or second in the formation, but this is something I
have only heard, I don't know if its true or not, but if Ox is in the
lead, his slow speed can make monsters attack you more often than not.
Can anyone verify this for me or know if its even true or not??

Starting Stats:
Level: 16 HP: 168 AP: 30 Strength: 73 Vigor: 71 Agility: 14 Wisdom: 40
Luck: 21
Weapon: Club
Shield: SuedeSH
Armor: BronzAR
Helmet: None
Spells: Cura3, Heal

Map Ability: Punching
With this ability, Ox can break down walls in dungeons and punch items
like Coconuts down from certain trees. You will need to use this
ability often, and while not all that useful, it can get you items
like the B. Rang and save you time through certain dungeons.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bleu: Bleu is the well I guess I could say wizard of the group. She has
all the attack spells, and most of them can make short work of a group
of enemies in no time at all. Later in the game she gains levels like
wildfire, being at about level 40 before anyone else ever hits the
30s. This allows for her to gain all her spells, and an large amount
of AP with which to use her deadly spells. Bleu's attack power is very
low, and her defense isn't much better, along with her HP. She should
be placed last in your party, or third if you have Nina with you.
Bleu's agility is high, meaning that she can get her spells of very
fast in battle.

Starting Stats:
Level: 19 HP: 119 AP: 159 Strength: 28 Vigor: 38 Agility: 59 Wisdom: 75

Helmet: None
Spells: Exit, Flare, Spark, Cold, 3.5, Para, Bomb, Sap, Warp, Rub,
Flame, Fry, Frost, 5.5, Boom

Map Ability: None
As far as I know or have tried, Bleu doesn't have any abilities that
can be used on the map or in dungeons.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mogu: Mogu is a small character, after all he is a mole, and that could
explain his lack of HP, attack and defense. After a few levels his HP
can jump to incredible amounts, yet his defense and attack remain low.
He levels up rather quickly, and that will jump up his attack and
defense more than a weapon and armor changes will. His only spell is
Dig with which he digs a hole in the ground and allows your party to
flee without any problem. Will not work with bosses or when the party
is indoors.

Starting Stats:
Level: 22 HP: 91 AP: 54 Strength: 80 Vigor: 52 Agility: 76 Wisdom: 45
Luck: 22
Weapon: DigCW
Shield: None
Armor: BronzAR
Helmet: None
Spells: Dig

Map Ability: Dig
Mogu will attempt to dig up items from the ground. Only works in sandy
areas, and the chances of finding an item is random. Items he digs up
aren't very good, but this is required to dig up the Root a key item
for advancing in the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Section III: Walkthrough

Ok here's a complete walkthrough for Breath of Fire, and hopefully I
can make it as accurate as possible. (I intentionally didn't include
step by step directions as to which way leads to the next location in
the game. I feel that if I list the exact way to head through the
game, it would take away the fun for those of you who read this, of
exploring the game which is about 80% of the fun. I did the same with
my FF2 walkthrough and so far haven't received any complaints about it
as of yet.)

Here is a list of events that I listed in numbered order in which they
should or have to be done in. Some events like the extras can be done
at any time after you have the required party member to access it.

[WoodSH     300GP]
[Hairband  1000GP]
[SilkGN    2800GP]

Monsters: Slime, Flea, Bulla

The game starts out in a rather strange fashion, but I think its cool.
The Hero wakes up to find that his village is engulfed in flames. An
old woman from his village wakes him up and urges him to follow. Make
sure you get the V. Potion out of the dresser because you won't have
another chance to do so. After you are finished, follow the old woman
to the left and go downstairs. Once you are downstairs, talk to
everyone to get some info on what is happening. You will need to talk
to the woman blocking the door to proceed, and two more characters
enter the room. It seems that the Dark Dragons are causing the
problems, opposite of the Hero's group the Light Dragons. Everyone
wants to fight the Dark Dragons, but Sara refuses to let them do
so, and changes everyone to stone. She then proceeds out to face them
alone. All you can do now is just sit back and watch the fighting that
happens. Sara is captured, and then it returns to the villagers and
the stone wears off them. They all flee the scene, and the old man and
woman tell you about the Legend of the Dragon and give you a chest
with 300 GP in it. You are now free to explore what's left of the
village. There are two shops, and item shop and weapon shop, and the
dragon shrine. You have 300 GP to use, and I would recommend buying
the ArmPad before heading out. Once outside, I usually stay near the
town until about level 3. Once obtaining level 3, you should return to
Drogen, buy as many herbs and antidotes you can afford, and you might
as well rest at the inn since its free. Once you are finished, follow
the path to Camlon.

2. Camlon

Items: 70 GPx2, Herbx5, BronzSD, Gauntlet, SuedeCP, Visor, Antdtx2, 150
GP (There are more items to be found after the town is rebuilt.)
Inn: Must return later
Shops: Must return later

Monsters: Creep, P.Bug, Beak, Gloom, Frog

Upon first entering Camlon, you'll find that the town is in ruins. It
appears that the Dark Dragons have already been here, and left nothing
behind. There are a few town people remaining, but most have already
left. The only building that can be entered is the dragon shrine. It
might be a wise idea to save you game now. When you are ready, head to
the castle and enter it. The castle isn't that hard to explore, but it
does require a lot of side trips due to large stones blocking the
straight forward path. There are two healing springs in the castle, so
now it might be a good time to build up to level 5 or 6 while these
free healing springs are available. The only monster that might prove
to be more annoying than harmful is the P.Bug. They often attack in
groups of two or three, and the only attack they use is a poison
attack, which always hits. If you're near the springs, poison
shouldn't be too hard to deal with, but if you're far away, you'll
need to use an antidote to continue. The Glooms thunder spell can be
painful with such low HP, and the Beaks do quite a bit of damage at
times. When you feel you are a high enough level, follow the path
through the castle, obtaining and equipping the BronzSD, Gauntlet, and
Visor as soon as you find them. Right near the boss, there are two
treasure chests, one to the left and the other to the right. The left
chest is trapped with "DarkMist" which drains all of you AP, and
inside the chest is an antidote. The right chest has a Sporing trap
(*wonders if that was meant to be Spring*) which fully heals your
HP/AP and it too contains an antidote. You should use the Sporing trap
last, so you'll be at full strength without having to use herbs to
heal before you fight the frog.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Frog

The Frog isn't too hard to kill if you're at least level 5. If you have
your newly found items equipped the Frog shouldn't cause over 15
points of damage. He gets the first attack, so you'll need to watch
your HP and heal before you get too low. Just keep hitting him with
your weapon, and once his hp runs out, he'll get his 'second wind'.
Most monsters get this, but it usually doesn't take that many hits
after to defeat them. It should only take one or two more hits to
finish off the Frog. Once he's defeated, make sure you get the two
chests behind him, and walk out. Now that the clear air has came into
the castle, there are no more monsters to fight so you are free to
walk out.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After walking out, the King will acknowledge you as a true Hero, and
then the ground suddenly begins shaking. The villagers mention that
the earthquake machine in Nanai must be under control from the Dark
Dragons. They also mention that it must be retaken but only at night.
Follow the small path to the west of Camlon, and you'll come to a beach
(nothing can be done at beaches at this time) and continue following
the path left. You'll come to a bridge to the north, and cross that,
and start heading east. There will be trees to the north, but again
nothing can be done yet. There will be a large sandy area to the south,
and follow that path. If done correctly, you should arrive at Nanai at
night. If not just walk around until night comes, then enter Nanai.

3. Nanai

Items: S. Potion, 150 GPx2, Herbx2

The item shop in Nanai cannot be entered because of the guard near it.

The Inn cannot be used in Nanai either.

Weapon Shop:
[IronRP    1800GP]
[LongSD    2250GP]
[Cloth        9GP]
[SuedeSH    135GP]
[SuedeCP    216GP]
[WoodSH     270GP]
[Hairband   900GP]
[SilkGN    2520GP]

Monsters: Gloom, P.Bug, Beak, Creep, Knight

There isn't a lot to do in Nanai except navigate through the town while
avoiding the guards. They won't bother you unless you get within two
or three steps away from them. The Inn is empty but the dresser there
has the S.Potion. In the row of houses in the upper portion of town,
there is one with two chests in it, each containing 150 GP. In the
weapon shop, there are good items but it is doubtful that you will be
able to afford it yet. You can find these items later in the game, but
if you want them, head down below and kill off some monsters for GP.
In the houses above the weapon shop, there is one that contains 2
herbs in it. Head down below the town when are you finished.

4. Below Nanai

Items: 650 GP, B. Stn, Antdt, F. Stn, Cure, 70 GP, Armpad, E. Key

This is a pretty small area to explore, with a few combat stones to be
found within. Save these stones for the boss, you'll need them. It
might be a good idea to spend a little bit of time down here to level,
I'd say to about level 9 or so, that way you'll have a chance to buy
some of the weapons above. After working your way through two
different floors you'll come to a large room with a Knight in it. Upon
entering the room, he will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Knight

This boss isn't hard to defeat. Your character should be faster than he
is, allowing for the first hit, and you can use your Herbs before he
can hit you. Start off the battle by using your B. Stone and F. Stone
to inflict 120 points of damage on him. Then just work on him with
your weapon. When he starts to get low on HP, he'll constantly use
Recover, and it can restore his HP more than you can damage him. This
can really make the battle annoying, as you get him almost dead, and
then he ends up healing his HP for two or three more hits to get back
to where you were. All you really need to do, is keep your HP above 20
since his Spark spell can inflict an even 20 points damage to you.
After he gets his second wind, he hits harder, so you'll need to be
careful here as well. After he dies, pick up the E. Key from the
machine, and then enter the portal. Nanai will be destroyed, and you
will end up at Camlon again. You will now have access to Windia, but
you'll need to walk back to Nanai, and walk through the destroyed
ruins, and follow the path to Windia.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Windia

Items: V. Potion

Inn-80 GP

Item Shop:
[Mrbl3     10GP]
[Herb      10GP]
[Antdt     15GP]
[T.Drop    20GP]
[Acorn     30GP]
[Charm    150GP]
[Life     500GP]
[Cure    2000GP]

Weapon Shop:
[Sabre     400GP]
[BronzSD   700GP]
[BronzRP   800GP]
[SuedeHT   200GP]
[WoodSH    300GP]
[SuedeGN   500GP]
[Visor     800GP]
[ChainML  2000GP]

This town is pretty dull, and there is only one item to be found in it.
The V. Potion is in the red colored house near the broken bridge. The
main goal here in Windia at this time, is to head to the Castle. There
you'll find that the King is ill, so it is decided that your character
will spend some time till the King returns, yes everyone is hiding the
fact that the King is ill. You will now take control of Nina for a
short time while you search for the Remedy.

6. Windia Castle

Items: Herbx4, SuedeSH, SuedeHT, Antdtx2

You must now take Nina to the cave that can be seen to the left of
Windia. You should first buy Nina some new equipment. If you didn't
buy the Silk Gown in Nanai, buy the Suede Gown in Windia. Both offer
better defense, and they weigh a lot less (A dress that weighs 25, I
just can't see that happening) allowing for Nina to use the E. Key
faster in battle. When you are set, head to the Aura Cave, to the left
of Windia.

7. Aura Cave

Items: Cure, SuedeGN, 150 GP, I.Ore, 70 GP, Herbx2, B.Stone, C.Stone

Monsters: Beak, Gloom, Creep

This is a short cave which leads to Romero. There are a few good items
in here, but make sure you don't forget the I.Ore which is a story
item, and you won't be able to advance unless you pick it up. It might
be a wise idea to earn some levels here, or at least some gold. After
you work your way through the cave, you'll be outside of Romero. There
is also some stones to pick up and some money, so make sure you don't
leave them behind.

8. Romero

Items: L. Potion, ProtnB, Map

Inn-60 GP

Item Shop:

[Herb x9    90GP]

[ShortRP   400GP]
[BronzRP   800GP]
[BronzSH   500GP]
[BronzHT  1200GP]
[Gown     2000GP]
[ChainML  2000GP]
[SilkGN   2800GP]

Monsters (Outside): Flea, Slime, Creep

There isn't a lot happening in Romero yet. Most of the problems here at
the moment, is that the evil wizard has taken all the girls of the
village away for his experiments. This might be a good time to upgrade
your equipment, and buy some more herbs if you start running low.
There are a few items in town, so should look around, and learn some
background info if you'd like to. You should also grab the map while
you're in Romero. There is a building with a hole in the floor. Fall
through the hole and you'll come to a place with four jars in a
pattern, where you have to push them in a certain order to advance.
The four jars look like this:

Legend:

|: Wall
1-4: Jars

 1 2|
|3  |
|  4

First push jar 4 to the right, and the jars should look like this now:

 1 2|
|3  |
|   4

Next push jar 2 up, and the jars will look like this:

|  2|
 1  |
|3  |
|   4

Finally push jar 1 to the left and behind the wall and it will look
like this:

|  2|
1   |
|3  |
|   4

You can push the barrel at the top of the room in any direction, and
then search it to find the map. (With the map you can push start while
on the overworld to view the map. Note it only shows what you have
discovered by walking around.)

On the left side of town there is an exit out of town, and it leads you
to the forest area outside Romero.

9. Karma Forest

Items: Herbx2, 150 GP, Bandage

Monsters: P.Bug, Spider, Creep

This is a small maze with a few annoying enemies in it. The P.Bugs and
Spiders can poison in here, so take some Antidotes with you so you
won't have to use all of Nina's AP on healing the poison. If you start
to run low on HP and don't want to use herbs or Nina's Cura magic,
look in the forest for the red mushrooms. The red ones will heal
whoever is in the front of you party, so if the soldiers need healed,
be sure to change them to the front to eat them. Don't eat the yellow
mushrooms, they are poison and cause HP damage. You might want to
spend a little time here and gain two or three levels until Nina
learns ATK-UP. After learning that spell, head out of the forest and
head toward Karma Tower.

10. Karma Tower

Items: Herbx3, M.Dropx2, Charmx2, Life2, Curex2

Monsters: Spider, P.Bug, Beak, Gloom, Creep, Morte, Mortea, Zard,
Wizard

This tower is large, with a lot of treasures to find. There is a pool
right near the entrance, so you can spend almost a limitless time in
here if needed. Downstairs you'll find two herbs, and the first boss
of the tower, Morte is guarding the passage farther into the tower.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Morte

Morte isn't too hard to handle. Just have Nina, use the E.Key and
everyone else attack. After a few rounds Morte should die, if not just
keep your party healed up and follow the same pattern till he goes
down. Return to the pool and drink after defeating him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Morte, head upstairs and finish collecting the
treasures. After getting all the treasure, you'll have to walk around
a little bit to find Mortea. Since most bosses won't attack you until
you actually go up and talk to them, you should heal before going up
to Mortea.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Mortea

Mortea is quite a bit harder than Morte was. You might want to have
Nina use Fort on everyone, while having one of the Soldiers use the
E.Key and the other using any stones you might have. If you start
getting low on HP, just have Nina heal. After using Fort, have Nina
start using the E.Key and the Soldiers attack. Mortea should go down
quickly after his second wind, but he's fast, so you need to keep an
eye on your HP and heal before its too late.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Mortea, head upstairs and step on the switch to form a
bridge to the opposite tower. There you'll find the girls that the
wizard has captured. Open the door, and step on the switch inside it
and a bridge leading back east will be formed, and the girls will go
across it allowing for passage below. It would be a good idea to drink
from the pool, and take advantage of the save point here.

10. The Wizard's Tower

Items: Rang, Remedy

Upon entering this tower with Nina's Party, you'll encounter the Wizard
right off. He uses Xeon gas to disable Nina and the others, and then
he attacks them. *You cannot win this battle, so don't waste all your
items trying to fight back.* After a few rounds, one of the soldiers
decides to leave and go get some help. The battle resumes, but this
time around, the wizard will attack, but don't use any items. After he
defeats you, the remaining soldier will fly back to Windia, and they
enlist the Hero to help them because the gas will not work on him. You
may want to upgrade his armor here if you haven't done so already. You
might want to buy some more herbs if you need them. After you are
finished, head outside, and talk to the soldier and he will fly you to
the tower, and then join you shortly. After heading back down to where
the Wizard is, make sure you pick up the Rang. While its weaker than a
sword, make sure you keep it handy since it will attack all the
enemies at once in battle. Make you're way through this small area and
confront the Wizard.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Wizard

The Wizard isn't too tough to handle, but he does get the first attack.
Just keep using the E.Key for an easy 30 points damage per round. If
you're lucky, he'll keep using Fort, and thus not get any attacks for
that round. He can use Thunder which hits you for 10, and Freeze which
hits for 15. Just keep your HP above this and you can't go wrong.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the Wizard, Nina will collapse from the gas, and the
Hero will take her upstairs and you'll get a free ride back to Windia.
Nina gives the remedy to the king who recovers and allows you passage
through the basement of Windia, which leads to the next towns, Tantar
and Tuntar. Nina also joins your party for good now.

[Visor     800GP]

Weapon Shop (Tuntar): None

Monsters (Outside): Blurb, Creep, Gloom, Zombie, Stool, WarHog

After crossing the bridge from Windia, and following the road, you'll
come across some woods which you cannot enter. Keep this location in
mind, you'll be back there soon enough. Now would be a good time to
equip the Rang that you found earlier. The combination of the multi-
hitting Rang plus the damage from the E.Key is more than enough to wipe
out the small monsters here, and can earn you some quick exp and gold.
Head south from the woods, and you'll come to a town on the western
side of what looks like a dry riverbed. That town is Tantar, and sure
enough, the Dark Dragons are behind the water shortage. They demand
the Ring of the village, and will not restore the water until they get
the Ring. Tantar doesn't want to give in, but the problem is hurting
the neighboring village as well. You might want to upgrade your
equipment here, and head over to Tuntar and see what is happening over
there. Before leaving Tantar, visit the blacksmith, and he'll turn
your useless I.Ore into a Saw that you can use to get into that
forest. It seems that over in Tuntar, the chief has been seen near the
northern woods, and now he's back in the village and is acting
strange. You might want to buy some acorns here, so you can give them
to Bo to restore 20 of his AP, so he can use his semi-decent attack
spells on the future bosses till you become stronger. Head back up to
where that forest was, and use the saw to cut the trees down and
enter.

12. Forest of Despair

Items: Herb, T.Dropx2, Life, Wrist

Monsters: Stool, Zombie, S.Rider, G.Knight

The forest here isn't too bad, but there are a few tougher monsters in
here. Make sure you bring some T.Drops with you to cancel the Zombie
affect that some of the monsters can put on you. The place you are
looking for is in the upper-right-hand corner of the forest. Be sure to
pick up the items in the forest, and it might be a good idea to try to
gain a level or two while here.

13. Fortress

Items: T.Dropx3, Lifex2, LongSD, WolfHT, Life2, Acorn, Herbx5

Monsters: Bowman, Lancer, Midget, WarHog, S.Rider, Zard, Pog*, General

This area while short, takes quite a bit of walking around to avoid the
various traps in the floor that are set. You can only get some items
by doing this, so it might be a good idea to fall through the holes at
least once to get them. There are various guards here, and yet while
the boss battle music plays, I don't consider them bosses and I won't
count them as such. On the first floor, head to the upper left part of
the screen, while avoiding the holes, I'll leave the location up to
you to find, but I do believe there is only 3 places where you can
fall through. Head down the stairs when you find them. On the second
floor, head downstairs and pick up the treasures. Beware of the
treasure box that has the WolfHT, it s a fire trap and will cause 50
points damage to whom ever opens it. Your goal in this room, is to
head to the upper part of the screen, and defeat the 3 guards, holding
the chief hostage. After they are defeated, the chief suggests that
you go and take their weapons. You have to answer 'Yes' to proceed. At
the end of the hallway, the chief locks you in a cell, and you'll have
to fight Pog. You can also choose 'No' a couple of times and you'll
learn that the chief is an imposter. Bo will come out with the real
chief and the imposter will reveal himself, and you'll bypass fighting
Pog.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Pog*
*: Only if you answered 'Yes' to the fake chief.

Pog isn't too hard to defeat. Since Pog is but one enemy, be sure to
equip the LongSD you found down here, before fighting those 3 guards.
The LongSD is stronger than the Rang and hits harder versus one
monster. At the start of the fight, have Nina use Fort on the Hero and
herself, then ATK-UP on the Hero. The Hero should attack or use the
E.Key while Nina is performing the spell ups. After she's finished,
have the Hero go back to attacking, and Nina should start using the
E.Key. Just keep your HP above 20 and you should be fine. I didn't
notice this at first, but after Pog gets his second wind, he can
attack with both heads. I don't know if he can do this before the
second wind, so make sure you keep your HP up if he decides to attack
the same member with both heads.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After Pog is defeated, Bo will come in and open the cell by shooting an
arrow into the switch. Then Bo will explain that he rescued the real
chief while the Hero and Nina were fighting with Pog. The fake chief
then turns into a monster and attacks you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: General

The General isn't too hard, but he is faster than your party. Have Nina
use Fort on Bo right away because his defense isn't too good, and the
General can come close to killing him in one hit. Have the Hero use
the E.Key for 30 points of damage, and Bo should use Fry to inflict 80
points damage per round. Nina should then use ATK-UP on the Hero, and
the Hero for the second round should use the E.Key again, and Bo
should use Fry again. On the third round, have the Hero attack, Bo
should attack as well, he'll be out of AP by this time, and Nina
should use the E.Key or heal anyone that needs it. If she is required
to heal, have Bo use the E.Key instead. After a few rounds he'll be
out of the way, and you're then free to head back to Tantar and
Tuntar. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Be sure to equip Bo, with the WolfHT and the ShortBW if you bought it
back in Tantar. If you didn't don't worry too much about it, just buy
one when you get back there. Now walk out of the fortress and return
to Tantar. You might want to earn some levels till Nina can get to
level 14 so she can learn Warp, and that'll save you some walking
time.

14. Return to Tuntar

There isn't a lot of to do here in Tantur, but you do need to talk to
the Chief and learn about the Stone Robot. He then points you in the
direction of Agua which is the tower next to Romero. Now with Bo in
your party, head back to the bridge leading back to Windia, but keep
heading north and just walk through the forest near Romero and enter
the town.

15. Return to Romero

Items: WtrJr, Herb

It seems that there has been some trouble in Romero since you were here
the last time. The Wizard's experimenting seems to have caused Zombies
to raise from their graves and start causing problems in the town. You
must talk to everyone in town, and learn about the Cleansing Water,
and talk to the Chief, and he'll make you an offer, remove the Zombies
from town, and he'll talk about Agua. Now you need to exit the town,
and re-enter at night and talk to the old woman in the graveyard. Her
zombie husband will open a secret underneath the tombstone, and
fall down the hole, and get the WtrJr. Your next stop is to the cave
with the Cleansing Water in it, to the southwest of Romero.

**Now I have received a lot of email about this part of the game in the
past, and I had a problem here when I first played through, but if the
zombie husband isn't around, then you need to return to Tantar and
Tuntar and speak with everyone then come back and that should fix the
problem.**

16. Cave of the Cleansing Water

Items: Herbx3, NiceHT, F.Stone, T.Drop, BronzHT, Apple, Cleansing Water

Monsters: G.Knight, Blurb, Ameblob, Mage

This cave is a short one, with only one real importance to it, at this
time, to get the Cleansing Water, to remove the Zombies from Romero.
There are a few new enemies down here, but none are really tough
except for the Ameblobs. They use a Flare spell which causes 20
damage, and constantly use Recover, which raises the number of rounds
it will take to eliminate them. If you want to defeat them quickly
have Bo use Fry for 120 damage to them. There are a few new pieces of
equipment to be found in here, so you'll want to equip those after you
acquire them. On the third floor heading down, you'll come to the
Cleansing Water spring. After filling the Jar, you'll get a free ride
back to Romero. Remember this place, because you can refill the jar
and it will become the WtrJr', which holds the water. When used on the
Menu screen, it will act as a one time inn, restoring everyone's
status, HP and AP. You can return to the spring as many times as you
need and keep refilling the jar after it is used up. Upon your return
to Romero, the water will be used up automatically, and it will
eliminate the Zombies in town. The party then ends up with the Chief
and he'll thank you and leaves the Tablet for you to enter Agua
with along with a Herb, and Antidote, a Cure and 900 GP. Your next
stop should be first the Inn and then head out of Romero and head to
Agua.

17. Agua

Items: Herbx2, Apple, Acornx2, Life2, SunHT, IronSH, ThiefCL, Hairband,
Bracelet, SteelBW, KngKey

Monsters: Zombie, G.Knight, S.Rider, WarHog, Wisp

This tower has a lot of treasures to offer, but there are many that
cannot be reached yet, but fear not, you'll be able to come back for
them soon. Do be sure to search the walls on the right side of the room
on the same floor with Wisp, and you'll find a treasure box hidden in
a rather good spot. The tower is pretty straight forward, with an 
occasion riding of moving platforms to get from one area to the next.
Along the way there are some armors to find and equip if they are
better. At the top of the tower you'll find Wisp, guarding a key,
which he won't hand over until you've proven yourself to him. You have
no choice but to fight him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Wisp

The first thing you should do while fighting Wisp, is the have Nina use
Fort on the party, while having Bo use Fry, and the Hero using the
E.Key. Wisp's attacks don't really hurt anyone except for Bo, so
you'll have to watch his HP. After Nina uses Fort on everyone, use
ATK-Up on Bo and the Hero. If Bo runs out of AP, give him some Acorns,
and keep using Fry on Wisp. After everyone has received Fort and ATK-
Up, have Bo and the Hero attack and Nina use the E.Key and heal when
needed. Wisp doesn't have a second wind, and will be defeated when his
HP is gone. You reward for defeating him is the KngKey which will
activate the Giant Stone Robot.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Wisp, walk out of the tower, and head back to Tantar.
You'll have to find the Stone Robot, and its northeast of Tantar and
Tuntar. Just follow the path from Tuntar northward and you should find
the Robot. Enter the robot and work your way up in it, and you'll find
the place to use the KngKey to start it soon.

18. Giant Stone Robot

Items: Herb, BronzHT, Life2, Mrbl1, Acorn

Monsters: Blurb, G.Knight, Zombie, Midget, Fungus, General, Lancer,
Gremlin*

*Only after getting the Ring.

The first part of the Robot is pretty easy. Just work your way up into
it and follow the path that is in front of you. You'll soon come to a
few guards inside the Robot and that you give them the key, and attack
you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: General w/ 2 Lancers

This battle isn't too tough. Just work on the Lancers first, while they
aren't the main target, one less attack per round for the enemies will
help. Have Nina use Fort on the party, and have Bo use Fry on the
Lancers, and the Hero should use the E.Key. After Nina uses Fort on
everyone, have her use ATK-UP on Bo and the Hero, who should continue
to use Fry and the E.Key. If Bo runs out of AP, just feed him an
Acorn, and then start again using Fry. The battle should be much
easier after the two Lancers are out of there. The General has the
first attack against the party, so make sure you heal while your HP is
above what he can cause. The Lancers attacks inflict between 10-20
depending on who they hit, and the General is about 20-40 per hit.
Again, just watch your HP and you should be fine during the fight.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you defeat the General and his little henchman, put the Key into
the slot behind where the General was, and the Robot will come to
life. Now just follow the path of teleports to the Robot's control
room. The first teleport to take is the one next to the stairs that
you entered the room from. Avoid taking the second portal up from
where you exit, it will lead back to the beginning. Instead, follow
the path around, and you'll come to another portal at the end. Next,
take the closest portal to an item box. You'll be back at the
beginning again, but just retrace you're steps and you'll be back in
no time at all. Take the portal to the furthest right, and enter that
portal. Again, enter the nearest portal here, for two more treasure
boxes. Thankfully, re-entering this portal, will lead back to the one
you just entered. Follow the path again to the furthest portal and
enter that one. The final portal is pretty easy to find, its right
in front of you. Enter that portal, and the Robot will activate, and
destroy the rock blocking the water from Tantar and Tuntar. Now you
need to return to Tantar and Tuntar again. Upon entering Tantar, go
talk to the village chief, and he'll tell you to search for the Ring,
and he'll move his chair, and you can go down and find the Key to
enter the cave with the Ring in it. You'll also find an herb below.

19. The Ring Cave

Items: W.Potion, Life, Life2, 2000 GP, Herb, Acorn, SkySH, Ring

Monsters: Ameblob, Blurb, Zard

You must now head back to where the Robot was left at. There is a short
cave to travel through, with only a W.Potion of any interest in it.
After you find your way through it, you'll come to the cave which
houses the Ring. The cave is a small maze, which requires you to fall
down waterfalls, and to travel both above and below ground. You'll
find a new shield for Nina, along with some other items. At the end of
the cave, you'll find the Ring and a portal which will take you back
to the beginning of the cave. You should equip the Hero with the Ring
as soon as you find it, as it will add +10 to his attack power. Enter
the portal and walk back to Tantar or you can warp back. You'll find
that the ceremony for the wedding is underway. Now would be a good
time to head back to the Inn and rest. You should also head back to
the Dragon Shrine and save your game. When you are ready, head to the
chief's house, and watch the ceremony. While all of this is happening,
the General takes control of the Giant Robot and destroys, Tuntar. He
then tries to turn the Robot onto Tantar, but the Robot can sense that
this is an evil act, and will not do it. Now its your chance to get
into the Robot and retake control of it. Work your way up the Robot,
and get ready for perhaps the toughest boss battle in the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Gremlin

When this battle begins, have Nina use Fort on everyone, starting with
herself, then Bo and the Hero. Then use ATK-UP on the Hero, and have
Bo use Acorns on himself when he runs out of AP from using Fry. Have
the Hero use the E.Key for the first few rounds, until Nina finishes
spelling everyone up, then have him just attack. The Gremlin isn't too
mean except when he hits Bo, until he reaches his second wind. He then
has attacks which can harm all your party members at once, and he will
always get the first attack. This is the perfect time to stop Bo from
using Fry, and save his AP for healing himself when Nina needs to heal
herself or the Hero. If you went back to the Cleansing Water Spring to
fill your Jar, you may need to save it just for a place like this, if
you need a major heal right away. Just keep hitting on the Gremlin and
use the E.Key and Bo's Fry when you feel you'll be able to recover from
his attacks, and just hope for the best. If he overkills you with
extreme damage, it might be a wise idea to upgrade your armor and try
to gain a few more levels and try again. On this game practice doesn't
make perfect, but time and a higher level will.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the Gremlin, the Robot will move on its own and will
take your party to the volcano south of what remains of Tuntar. It
will then plunge itself into the volcano, thus sacrificing itself, but
it can never again be used as a weapon to destroy towns and innocent
people. The Robot going into the volcano will cause it to erupt, and
the lava will solidify, forming a bridge in a sense that you can
cross, allowing for passage to the south. Before heading south to
Auria, there are a few places of interest that you should take a few
moments to look at them before continuing. The first is a Dragon
Training Shrine, in which the Hero can learn to Morph into his first
three dragon forms if he can pass the test the Dragon Elders have
for him. This is a one-on-one battle, but its not too hard to handle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Talon

While this is a one-on-one battle its not as hard it would seem. First,
you should set the Hero to the back row, reducing the damage done to
him. After the battle starts, just keep using the E.Key every round.
Talon will get the first attack, but he only inflicts between 10-15
damage per hit, so just make sure your herb supply is good, and use
them before your hp gets this low. The battle may take a few rounds,
but the end result will be well worth it. Talon doesn't have a second
wind, and that means he's done after he runs out of HP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Talon, the Hero will gain the ability to Morph into
three different types of dragons, The Snow Dragon, The Flame Dragon,
and the Thunder Dragon. Each dragon uses a different amount of AP, and
it takes a one round wait before he can start attacking as a dragon.
The damage each dragon does is as follows:

Snow Dragon: 100 damage/200 on slam, 150 damage on enemy weak to
ice/300 on slam
Flame Dragon: 115 damage/230 on slam, 172 damage on enemy weak to
fire/344 on slam
Thunder Dragon: 130 damage/260 on slam, 195 damage on enemy weak to
thunder/390 on slam

As you can see, it pays to watch the type of enemies to determine
their weaknesses. Some of them are dead give aways, like a monster
that is made of fire or uses fire is going to be weak to ice
(usually), a monster made of or uses ice is weak to fire. Monsters
that live underwater are weak to thunder, and undead monsters are
going to be weak to fire, plus the Zom spells. Not all things work
like this, so it takes some experimentation to figure it all out. The
next stop on your way to Auria should be in the area with the Faeries.
You will be able to tell where they live at, is that the ground in the
area is a different color. You'll find out that the Faeries are upset
about a person cutting down the trees and have trapped him there. If
you explore further, you'll find him running in circles as the result
of the Faeries' spell. Now that you've seen this all and won the
battle for the dragon spells, head to the cave to the left and proceed
to Auria.

20. Auria Cave

Monsters: Shadow, Ameblob, Midget, Fly

This is a short cave, with nothing exciting happening here for the time
being. If you explore a little, you'll find a place with rocks
blocking the way. You'll have to return here later, so keep it in the
back of your mind for now. Once you get out of the cave, head south
and you'll soon find the town of Auria.

21. Auria

Items: Life x3, Life2, S.Potion, W.Antler, Cure x3, V.Potion, Mrbl1,
2000 GP, L.Potion, Mrbl3, Acorn, SmartRG, Antdt, G.Tiara, 2000 GP,

[Tiara    1650GP]
[SunHT    2750GP]
[SageML   3300GP]

Right upon entering Auria, you are thrown in jail for no apparent
reason. While in jail, talk to the man in the bed (who is Karn and
will join you later). He'll let you out and now you can explore the
town. You need to watch out for the guard that's still in town, by the
Dragon Shrine and the Inn. If you get too close to him, you'll end up
in jail again. If so, just talk to Karn again, and he'll let you back
out. You need to head over to the docks on the west side of town, and
see if you can use a boat. The captain tells you that the rich man,
Ross, owns the ship that is there at the moment. You must now work
your way back across town, and head north, while avoiding the guard.
Ross' house is the big one at the very top of the screen. You might
want to explore the other houses and get the items from the boxes and
treasures inside. Be careful, in one of the houses, if you try to take
the box downstairs, you'll be back in jail again. You should also take
the treasures from Ross' house and then talk to him. He'll ask you
to help him and if you do he'll lend you his ship. It seems that his
daughter has locked herself in the safe downstairs, and she needs to
be let out. Your next trip should be to travel to the town of Bleak
where all the thieves hang out, and maybe one of them can unlock the
safe. *Now comes the part of getting the 65000 GP for the G.Bar which
you need to buy so you can trade that for the Icicle in Bleak to
eventually get Karn. There are a few places to earn some quick cash in
Auria. The first for an easy 20000 GP is in one of the houses, have
Nina give the old man upstairs a massage, and he'll fork up the 20000
GP for that. Ok, that leaves only 45000 GP left to gain. The second is
to go to the item shop and buy a vitamin. Upstairs from that shop is a
man who is complaining of having hiccups. Give him the vitamin, and
he'll be thankful that his hiccups are gone, and give you 5000 GP. Ok
only 40650 GP to go from here. You can also sell the G.Tiara from
Ross' house for 13000 GP. Be sure to sell it to the other shop in Auria
and not Gobi's shop otherwise you'll only get 11000 GP for it. The
final way in Auria to get a quick some of money is to save the man
from the Faeries that you saw earlier. You will have needed to talk to
both him and the Faeries earlier, and if not this won't work until you
do. His mother lives in a house below Ross, and she says that he's
been gone for a while and hasn't been back. Then she asks you to save
him from the Faeries. Now you must return back to where the Faeries
were at. The Faeries say they will let him go if you can make him stop
logging. You have to say 'Yes' to do so. Go back to the east and talk
to him, and then warp or walk back to Auria and talk to his mother
again and you'll get another 20000 GP. That makes 57350 GP earned with
7650 GP left to gain. You're pretty much done with Auria now, its time
to head to Bleak. Head to the cave east of Auria and begin your
journey there.

22. Bleak Cave

Items: ShellHT, Cure

Monsters: Fly, Midget, Bully

This cave is well I wouldn't say long, but it requires a lot of side
tracking through it because of locked doors and the works. Upon first
entering the cave, there are two men blocking the passage. If you
didn't talk to Ross they won't let you through. If you had, they'll
move and tell you to watch yourself in Bleak since its full of
thieves. Now you're ready for the long walk through the cave. After
heading down the stairs if Karn was with you, you could easily go
through that door, but things weren't meant to be that easily done.
Just follow the path to the left, and stick to it, and things should
be fine. Battle wise, you need to watch out for the Bully. They can
use Fry causing 80 damage to a single party member, and they also have
a Thunder spell which does about 70+ points of damage to the whole
team. While continuing through the cave, you'll find a broken down
wall, and two treasure boxes. Collect the items and continue through
the cave. You'll find a staircase leading up on the other side of the
door, so take that one up. On the second floor of the cave, if you
follow the path to the north, you'll come across a locked door, and a
wall that can be broken, both of these have to be done later. If you
continue to follow the path, you'll come up to a switch. Push the
switch, and you can open a shortcut by opening the gate, which leads
back to the entrance of the cave, right outside of Auria. You need to
follow the path back the way you just came, and continue following it
south till you are outside.

23. Village of Bleak

Items: Herbx4, Life2, Life, W-Ant, Icicle

Monsters (Outside): Fly, G.Slime, Mage, G.Knight
Cave to Arad: Shadow, Midget, Ameblob, Fly

Inn: Free (Make sure you have a pouch while using it for the first
time)

Item Shop:
[Herb       12GP]
[Herb x9   108GP]
[Antdt      18GP]
[T.Drop     24GP]
[Acorn      36GP]
[Charm     180GP]
[Life      600GP]

[HuntCL   1500GP]
[IronSL   2000GP]
[BronzAR  3600GP]
[WoolRB   5000GP]

There isn't much to do in this town, except trade your G.Bar for the
Icicle. Make sure you have a pouch, which can be bought in Auria. If
you try to sleep at the inn, the innkeeper will let you stay for free,
but he tries to rob you at night. The pouch will come in useful here,
and he'll give you 5000 GP if you keep your mouth shut. You should
have enough for that G.Bar now, so you can warp back to Auria and buy
one. If not, you can hunt outside of Bleak, and hope for G.Slimes.
These little guys are worth big gold, over 1000 GP for 3 of them, and
are worth over 1000 exp each, so you might gain a few quick levels
here as well. Once you have the G.Bar go talk to the guy in the house
at the top of the town, and trade for an Icicle. You can now hit up
some gold and levels, or travel towards the desert through the cave
south of Bleak. It may be a good idea to kill some monsters around
here, so you can upgrade your weapons and armor. In the cave south of
Bleak, just follow the one-way path through the cave, and you'll end
up at the desert. Head south and you'll find the small town of Arad,
and to the south of it is the Krypt. You may also see the small town
of Wisdon moving about nearby. However there is nothing to be done
with this town yet. Just head into Arad for now.

24. Arad

Item: Only the Fife is to be found here after defeating the boss.

Monsters: Prickle, Cactus, Scorp, SandClod, Sandworm*, G.Slime,

Inn: Free

It seems that Arad has a problem. There is a huge Sandworm that is
eating their goats at night, and they need someone to put a stop to
it. The leader of Arad will trade you the Fife which is needed to
enter the Krypt if you will kill the Sandworm that is plaguing his
town. If you say yes, you'll have to wait till night to fight it,
which the game passes for you automatically. If you are ready, go and
fight the Sandworm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Sandworm

This fight is going to be a little easier now that the Hero can use his
dragon powers. Have him change into the Thunder Dragon, while having
Bo use Fry, and Nina using Fort on the party. The dragon will inflict
130 damage a hit unless its a slam which will be 260. After Nina
spells everyone up, have her use the E.Key or use Acorns on Bo to help
him keep up with his Fry attack. The Sandworm shouldn't last but a few
rounds, and if he does, just heal up as needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you defeat the Sandworm, head back to the Elder's house, and
he'll give you the Fife, and you can now enter the Krypt. Head back to
the Inn and heal up and save before heading to the Krypt.

25. The Krypt

Items: Herbx3, DreamRG, Lifex2, IronSH, Dagger, Headgear, SkullHTx2,
Cure, IcyHT, Antdt, Book, HuntCL

Monsters: E.Chest, Scorp, Mage, Fly, EyeSpy, G.Slime, WarHog,

This is a fairly amusing place to be in. There are a lot of pitfall
traps, throwing your party to a large empty room below, and then you
have to climb out and try again without falling down another hole.
Next all of the treasure boxes have traps on them, so it would be best
to leave them until you can have Karn join your party. Overall the
monsters in the Krypt aren't any harder than the ones you have faced
already, so work your way down and begin your search for Karn. In the
area with all the treasures, you'll have to watch for the traps on the
floor. They are in set locations and fill up an intersection something
like this:
   |    |
   |    |
---|    |---
   ======
   =    =
   ======
---|    |---
   |    |
   |    |

You'll have to forgive the poor drawing of this example, I'm not that
great at drawing with symbols like this but I'm sure you'll get the
idea on what it is. The ---| shows a part of the intersection where a
treasure box is on, while the === show where the pits are at. Knowing
this, if you walk along the walls, you should be able to get where
you're going without any problems. On the third floor of the basement,
you'll find another lone treasure box, but its trapped so just leave
that one for now. You'll also see a boomerang in some stone, but you
can't do anything with that either. Continue to head up, and you'll
fight the boss of the Krypt, the EyeSpy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: EyeSpy

You should start off with the EyeSpy by first having the Hero use the
Thunder Dragon spell, have Bo, use Fry, and Nina should use Fort on Bo
and herself, then ATK-UP on Bo. After that continue hitting him with
the Hero, Bo should attack when he runs out of AP, and Nina should
use the E.Key and heal when it is needed. After all the small eyes
surrounding the EyeSpy disappear due to damage caused, it will
then stat casting T.Bolt every round, inflicting 25 damage on everyone,
so you may need to heal more often between rounds. Other than that,
the EyeSpy shouldn't give you too much trouble, and if does, try to
gain another level or two, or upgrade your equipment in Bleak after
that G.Bar set you back so much gold.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the EyeSpy head down the stairs, and follow the path.
You'll find several treasure boxes, along with a blue one. These are
the only boxes that aren't trapped in the Krypt so go ahead and open
them without fear, and enjoy your new items. When you open the Blue
chest, the area will begin to flood. Just when it looks like you're
going to drown, Karn will come and disarm the trap. He wants you to
find the book for him, while he waits. The party then convinces him to
help you. He'll head downstairs and you must follow him. After Karn
joins you, see if you have any left over equipment to hook him up
with, cause he'll need it. Then you party order should be 1)Karn so he
can disarm the traps, 2)The Hero since he's strong enough to be there,
3)Bo while he's capable of fighting, he doesn't have the defense to
stand up to it, and 4)Nina since she needs to be back there, but has
the magic to support your party. Now just follow the path, and find
the stairs that lead down. You'll soon come to a room which has
several caskets in it. This is where the book is, but you need to open
all the caskets, the order doesn't matter, the final one that you open
will be the one with the book inside it. Well the book actually
doesn't exist in a treasure box, its just a quote on the bottom of the
casket. Now that you have everything done here, walk out of the Krypt
and pick up all the items you missed, and head back to Bleak. You'll
need to have Karn to enter the Dark Tower, but first you might want to
upgrade his equipment in Bleak. When you're ready, head towards the
Dark Tower, northwest of Bleak.

26. Extra Things to Do Part I

Now that you have Karn and are able to pick locks there are a few
things that you should now take advantage of doing. First head back to
Windia and pick that lock in the basement and take the Flame Rapier,
Turban, Cure, Life2, Life, and the BrokenSD. You may want to equip
Nina with the FlameRP, but it has a battle use, which causes 90 points
of damage/use in battle. You can also return to Camlon which has been
rebuilt and has some items to collect including: a Mrbl1, ProtnA,
W.Potion, A.Potion, and a DkKiss. The Inn only costs 1 GP/night and
the item shop is:

Camlon Item Shop:
[Herb        8GP]
[Herb x9    72GP]
[Antdt      12GP]
[T.Drop     16GP]
[Acorn      24GP]
[Apple      80GP]
[Life      400GP]
[Cure     1600GP]

Now back to the extra things to do. Since you're in the area, you
should stop by and refill your water jar if you need to. This is well
I wouldn't call it a cheat, but now that you have Karn, you can go
back to Agua, pick the locks there, and get the LifeAR which is the
best armor in the game, along with some other powerful items. Return
to Agua to obtain the following items: FlameSH, LifeAR*, and an IcyDR*.
*Be sure to search the statues on the outside.* Just a little example
of how good this equipment is, I had the Hero using an IronSH and when
I equipped the FlameSH, his defense went up from 117 to 157 and I was
using the ThiefCL and then after equipping the LifeAR, my defense went
up from 157 to 242. Agua might be a little out of the way, but after
seeing this, I'm sure you'll agree with me. The final thing to do now
that you have Karn, is go back through the Cave to Bleak, and open the
doors that are locked in there. You'll need another G.Bar to buy the
GunPowder from Gobi, and it would take forever to earn up another
65000 GP, but fortunately, there is one in that cave, so it'll be worth
your time to go through it. After all that is finished, head back to
the Darkness Tower.

**I had several emails and I have seen some questions about that stupid
HeroAR typo of mine at the GameFaqs message boards and while I was
tempted to fix this guide a long time ago, as I said in the revision
history that someone altered it without my consent so that kinda killed
that idea back then but its all fixed now.**

27. Darkness Tower

Items: B.Stone, 2000 GP, Lifex2, Herb, Cure, HornHT, Turban, 2000 GP,
DkKey, Mirror*
*Available only after you beat the boss

Monsters: Slime, Fungus, Shadow, Chopper, Cloud

This tower isn't so bad, with only one enemy that can be a pain and
that being a group of Choppers. These are worse than the Midgets, (how
they can lift those axes is beyond me) and can drain your party's HP
rapidly. There is quite a few items in this tower, but most take a
long trip of walking to get there. The HornHT is probably the best
along with the gold, and the DkKey and the Mirror are story items. At
the top of the tower, you'll fight the Cloud.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Cloud

The Cloud is an interesting enemy to fight. I think he's the only boss
monster in the game that only attacks with spells. His spells aren't
too damaging except for maybe his Devistate spell since its an
earthquake that hurts the whole party at once. You should start by
changing the Hero into the Thunder Dragon, have Karn use the E.Key
while Nina uses ATK-UP and perhaps Agil-UP on everyone. Everyone
should just keep attacking and when Bo runs out of AP, he should start
attacking as well. Nina should use the E.Key or the FlameRP if you
didn't equip it. She should concentrate her efforts to healing the
party since the Cloud's spells can rapidly drain the HP of the whole
party. He doesn't have a second wind, so he won't get any harder after
he gets low on HP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
28. Back to Auria

Items: Herbx5, B.Stone, Dart, MetalSH, F.Stone, LtKey, GnPwder

Monsters: Knight, Archer

After you defeat the Cloud, you will win the DkKey. Head back down
through the tower, and talk to the Old Man, and grab the Mirror. Now
with the Mirror in hand, head back over to Auria. Once there, head
back to Ross' house, and head down to the basement and talk to his
daughter, and tell you a little about her father and the LtKey. Now
that you have the Mirror, head back upstairs again, and talk to Ross.
This is where the Mirror comes into play. It will show Ross' wife's
spirit, and she'll tell him that giving up the Key won't help their
daughter. He then realizes that he was wrong, and tell you to go tell
his daughter he was wrong. Head back downstairs again, and talk to his
daughter again. She'll tell you that the Dark Dragons are coming for
the Key, and she asks you if you'll help drive them away. Say 'Yes'
and head upstairs after you collect the treasures and grab the LtKey.
Now you must head out to the port, and kill off the Dark Dragons that
block your path.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Knight w/Archer

With this battle, you should use Thunder Dragon with the Hero, have
Karn attack, Nina use Fort on the party, and Bo should use Fry on the
Archer to reduce the enemies attacks per round by one. After the
Archer falls, just attack with your strongest attacks on the Knight,
and he'll go down after a few more rounds. Have Nina heal the party as
needed during the fight. The Knight nor the Archer have second winds,
so this battle should end rather quickly with the use of the Dragon
attack and Bo's Fry spell.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating those two, the Knight and his buddy will motion for the
other Dark Dragons to sink the Ship. They'll then leave (die
perhaps??) and then the Captain and Gobi will come to what remains of
the ship. Gobi then makes a mention of the Peninsula and about getting
to the enemy camp. He offers to trade you the GnPwder for another
G.Bar. If you haven't done so, travel back to the cave that leads to
Bleak, and have Karn pick the lock there, and get the G.Bar from
there. With the GnPwder in hand, head back to the cave north of Auria,
and blow up the rocks there and follow the other path to the enemy
camp.

29. Enemy Camp

Items: Herbx2, V.Potion, Acornx2

Monsters: Spearman, Archer, Squid

There isn't much to do here, except clean the ship out of enemies.
There are a couple of fights with Spearmen and Archers, and a boss
fight with the Squid.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Squid

This is one of the first battles where the Hero can take full advantage
of his Dragon Powers. Turn into the Thunder Dragon, since the Squid is
weak to Lightning the dragon will cause 195 damage per hit and 390
damage on a slam. Bo's Fry spell will also increase to 120 damage per
hit. Have Karn attack or use the E.Key, and have Nina use Fort on
everyone, and keep them healed up. The Squid gets first attack, and he
has two types of attacks, one that hurts one member, and another that
hurts everyone at once. You'll mostly have to worry about Karn and Bo
getting hit because of their bad defense ratings. Nina also takes a
beating, but being farther back, keeps her a little healthier for at
least one attack. If you want to cheat the Squid, use any Mrbl1's if
you have any to cause 390 damage to him per attack with the Dragon.
Just keep attacking him with the Hero and Bo using Fry, and with the
increased damage he shouldn't take very long to kill at all. Just be
sure to watch out for him during his second wind since he'll be able
to attack the entire party at once.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stolen Ship

Monsters: Spearman, Archer, Octo

After defeating the Squid, head down into the ship to pick up the items
because you won't have another chance to do so. Then you'll have to
head back to Auria again. Once there, walk to the docks, and you'll be
able to sail with the boat. You'll have to take Gobi with you, and
this can cause problems in your party formation. If Gobi is put in,
switch him out with Karn. Gobi doesn't do that well above water just
yet. A short time later, you'll be attacked by the Dark Dragons again,
and you'll slowly retreat to the bottom of the ship, and after a few
more fights with the Archers and Spearmen, you'll fight the Squids'
brother, Octo.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Octo

This fight should be handled in exactly the same way the last one was
with the Squid. Octo has a little more HP, so the fight may take a
little while longer, plus he can hit harder. Unlike the Squid, Octo at
least for me always attacked last, so this could work to your
advantage as well. If you have any Mrbl1's left over, use them here as
well. Make sure you keep Bo's AP up so he can cause the second most
damage per round, while Karn uses the E.Key and Nina uses Fort on
everyone, and keeps the party in good health. As long as Bo and the
Hero stay healthy, victory is almost a given.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Octo, he'll set fire to the GunPowder below the ship,
and it will explode, but it also takes the three Dragon ships with it.
When you come to again, you're on a small island near Prima which
under the ocean. You'll have to say 'No' to Gobi when he offers to
sell you the Gills for 1000000GP, which you can't have, the max GP is
1 short. Then answer 'Yes' to Gobi when he says he'll take all of your
gold and lend you the rest. You'll now have control of only Gobi, and
do some questing underwater at Prima and Gant.

30. Prima

Items: TideHT

Monsters (Outside): CactusX, CrawlerX, Fishy, Tentacle, CreonX,
Dogfish, Morteo*

The first thing you'll notice about Prima after finding it, is that its
the largest town in Breath of Fire. There are multiple item and weapon
shops, there are two inns, and the only place in town where you can
rename your characters. As I said before I'm not great at drawing
with symbols, but I'll try to make a small map of what Prima looks like
so you will be able to see what item shop or weapon shop I'm talking
about. Well here goes:

   |---|    ------   ------   ------ ----|

                            |            |

Well this map isn't perfect, but its pretty good if I do say so myself.
Now its time for the boring party of listing what each shop sales. For
the item shops and weapon shops, refer to the map above the for number
of each shop.

Phew thankfully that part is done with now. You may have noticed that
there is a * in the large shop. This is the shop which Gobi may act as
a vendor (there is one in Tunlan as well). Just have him in front of
your party, and press 'A' at the desk. Customers will come to him and
buy items from your inventory, or attempt to sell you something. These
customers buy and sell random items, and some of the weapons and
armors they sell are great for the time, so it might be worthwhile to
spend a little time with Gobi trying to obtain these items, but do be
warned, it gets boring really quick. I have added a section to the
bottom of the walkthrough for here and Tunlan at various parts of the
game and hopefully I get it right when they start changing goods. With
any luck you'll be able to use this so you can get the limited items
out of the shop that they'll sell for a short period of time and once
you advance too far in the game they stop selling them. Now back on
with the walkthrough.

You have two main goals in Prima to start with. The first is to get the
Gills, so the rest of your party can travel down here, but to do this,
secondly, you'll have to deliver the goods from Gant to Prima. You'll
receive the goods from the Guild master in the Gant Guild, and then
you have to bring them back to the town of Prima. Before heading out of
town, you'll really need to upgrade Gobi's equipment if you can afford
it. If not, its going to be tough going from here on out. It may be
wise to have some Mrbl3's with you so you can avoid fighting with Gobi
until you can get the rest of your party down here. While I usually
don't include the directions to the next area, look for Gant south of
Prima. You should find a small beach to the and that leads above water
to Gant. Just follow the small path, and you'll come across weak
enemies, and you'll end up at Gant.

31. Gant

Items: HrGlas, A.Potion, L.Potion, Goods

Monsters (Outside): Flea, Slime, Creep

Inn: 50 GP

Item Shop:
[Herb        8GP]
[Herb x9    72GP]
[Antdt      12GP]
[F.Stn      16GP]
[B.Stn      16GP]
[C.Stn      32GP]
[Charm     120GP]
[Cure     1600GP]

Weapon Shop:
[IronHR    3150GP]
[GiantHR   4050GP]
[HeroSP    6750GP]
[SpineHR  27000GP]
[IronSL    1800GP]
[MetalSL   2700GP]
[IronHT    6300GP]
[MetalAR   8100GP]

Upon entering Gant, you may want to explore the town and grab the items
that are in town. After picking up your items, you need to head to the
Guildmaster's house, and he'll ask you if you'll deliver the Goods
back to Prima. Just walk back from Gant to the beach, and reenter the
water and head back north. Use Mrbl3's if needed. Brings the Goods
back to the Prima Guild, and you'll receive the Gills. You'll then
hear explosions coming from above, and it will appear that the Dark
Dragons has attack someone from Gant. You'll end up at Inn2, and a
Ghost will try to take Ox to the Nether World. Gobi then makes the
suggestion that since they can't let the Ghost have Ox, he knows
someone who can chase the Ghost away, but tries to charge the Guild
Owner 10000GP for it. The owner offers 5000GP for it. Say 'No' twice
and make it 6000GP, and then head out of Prima back to the island.
After the rest of your party joins Gobi, head back to Prima and
upgrade your equipment, and you may want to head to Gant as well and
do some upgrading there too. You'll want to rearrange your party here.
I don't really like Gobi since he sucks period, I'll use the Hero, Bo,
Nina, and Karn. If you like or want to use Gobi, I suggest leaving out
Karn, since Gobi's spells underwater can sting more than Karn's speed
and low offense. If you're going to use Gobi, I suggest walking around
outside Prima for a little while and level him up a few times. Since a
lot of the equipment in Prima and Gant is expensive it might be good
to spend some time down there. When you're ready, head back to Inn2
and fight the Ghost.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Morteo

I don't know if this guy is related to Morte and Mortea or not, but the
name sure suggests otherwise. Here is the first boss where you have
five party members, yet can only choose from four of them. I typically
use the Hero, Bo, Nina and Gobi for this battle. All four of them
have spells that work against Morteo, and while Karn is fast, he can't
really pack much of a punch for now. Since Morteo is undead, have the
Hero use the Flame Dragon, Bo should use Fry, Gobi should use his
highest spell that is learned, and Nina should use Fort on everyone,
and then concentrate on using Zom1 on him if you have that spell
learned. This should inflict an even 522 damage per round. If the Hero
gets a slam, then it will be slightly higher. I also used EcoX so if
Gobi doesn't have that, it'll be slightly lower. If you don't want to
use Gobi, and decide to use Karn, it might be a good idea to buy a
Cane in town. Use this Cane in battle, to produce an attack similar
to Zom1, but it will only cause 80 damage instead of 120, but this is
well more damage than what Karn can do straight attacking. If you have
the FlameRP from Windia, you can use that for 90 damage a hit to him.
Morteo shouldn't last more then 5 or 6 rounds, and if he does, just
make sure you keep your attacks up, and have Nina heal you when it is
needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After Morteo is defeated, Ox will come around. The Guild Owner asks him 
why the Dark Dragons were chasing him, and he'll explain to you. It
appears that the residents of Gant are skilled in making weapons, so
the Dark Dragons acting like cowards took their families hostage to
force them to make a secret weapon. Everyone decides to help Ox out,
and he will join your party. You might want to setup Ox with some new
equipment, and try to gain him a few levels. Your next destination is
the Dark Dragon fortress, which can be reached from the beach to the
left of Prima. Before heading there, check out the section below on
extra things to do before heading to the fortress.

32. Extra Things to do Part II:

Now that you have Ox in your party and can smash down walls and break
rocks in towns and dungeons, it may be a good time to revisit some
previous locations. Your first stop should be Agua, where there are a
few walls, that can be smashed for some items. Head there, and break
down the walls to receive the following items: 3000GP, Life, SilverBR,
and a Life2. Your next stop should be back to Gant, and head back to
the top house. Push the shelf out of the way and use Ox, to break down
the rocks. Switch Karn to the lead, and you'll learn his first Morph
Spell, Shin. Shin combines Karn with Bo and Gobi, and allows him to
become the strongest character in the party at this point. Shin can
walk through the forests like Bo, plus he can hunt though I'd estimate
his arrows travel two or three times faster. Now with Shin, you can
solve Karn's offensive powers, it now cuts your party size back down
to four again. Now warp back to Auria and revisit the Cave to Bleak
and break down the wall in that cave. You'll get an A.Potion and a
L.Potion. Now this is the only required part to do, but you *must*
have to go back to the Krypt where the EyeSpy was, and break the rock
and get the B.Rang. After picking up these items, warp back to Gant,
and then walk back to Prima. Head out towards the beach to the left of
Prima, and head towards the Dark Dragon Fortress.

33. Fortress

Items: Herbx2, GiantHR, EchoHT, MetalSH

Monsters: Spearman, LancerX, Sorcerer, Archer, Toad

This fortress is rather short despite the ominous looks from the
outside of it. There are a few walls to have Ox break down here, but
only one needs to be broken to obtain some items. The other walls can
be broken down to save some time while walking to the back of the
fortress. There are a few fights with LancerX's down here. They aren't
too bad to deal with, but they can be annoying. Keep heading towards
the back of the fortress, and you'll soon come to where the prisoners
are kept, and you'll have to fight the Toad.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Toad

This fight may require a lot of healing, but that's ok since you should
have Cura3 by now, and if not, Cura2 will do fine. Have the Hero turn
into the Thunder Dragon, and have Ox attack, while using Nina use Fort
on the party, then ATK-Up on both Karn and Ox, and after that using
the FlameRP as an item to do 90 damage per hit, while healing as
needed. The Toad has a higher agility than everyone except Karn.
You'll need to plan ahead when healing, except healing with spells,
because you're characters will get the heal spells off first, before
the monster can attack. Just keep attacking him, and his HP will go
down rather fast. All you need to watch out for during his second
wind, is that his damage is increased by quite a bit. Just heal before
you get too low, and you should be fine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the Toad, you have a short conversation with the
prisoners in the fortress. They tell you that the weapon has been
taken to Nabal Castle to the north, which is known for its defense. It
seems that you will need some other way to sneak in. They then mention
that the old man who lives in a tent near Gant was once in the Dragon
Army and perhaps could offer some help. Head out of the fortress and
Warp back to Gant, and head back to the beach leading to Prima but
keep heading to the right instead of entering the water. *This is why
you must have the B.Rang or I don't think you can proceed*. Upon first
talking to the old man, he'll notice that you have a B.Rang but its
broken, and that there is someone in Gant who might be able to
fix it. You now have to either Warp or walk back to Gant, and talk to
the guy in the uppermost house who gave you the Goods earlier, and
he'll fix the B.Rang for you. After its fixed, head back to the old
man again. He'll then tell you about a bird called a GrimFowl, which
is tame unless its Egg is taken, then it goes mad. He then mentions
about something that could be used as a weapon. For now head, back to
the Fortress, and head out the back exit of it. You'll notice there
are a few paths to take from here. If you go left, you'll come to the
second Dragon Training Shrine, but you don't have the DragonSD yet, so
you can't undertake the training. You should head north into the
forest for the time being.

34. Nabal Forest

Monsters: Grimfowl

Items: Egg*

There is nothing to do in this forest except grab the GrimFowl Egg, and
to defeat the GrimFowl boss. Just head north, and you'll soon come to
the Egg. As soon as you examine it, you'll get attacked by a GrimFowl.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: GrimFowl

You should start off the fight with the GrimFowl by having the Hero
change into the Snow Dragon because the GrimFowl is weak to Ice
attacks. Have Karn and Ox attack, and Nina should use Fort and ATK-Up
on everyone, while healing as needed. If you have some Mrbl1's to use
here, use them with the Hero to inflict 300 damage to the GrimFowl.
The GrimFowl uses some Fire based spells, so you'll have to keep your
HP up a little higher than normal to avoid being defeated by a spell
with too little HP to withstand it. The GrimFowl gets a little meaner
during its second wind, but it shouldn't take too long to defeat. If
you have the Shield spell, have Nina use that to help reduce the
damage done to you by the spells of the GrimFowl.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the GrimFowl is defeated, pick up its egg and slowly walk to the
north towards the exit, one step at a time. All of the GrimFowl in the
area should line up behind you, so move one step at a time towards the
exit. The GrimFowl should still be behind you after exiting the
forest, so keep moving slowly to the north, towards Nabal Castle. When
you're close enough to the castle, the game will automatically make
you throw the egg into the castle, and then the GrimFowl will cause
some major chaos with the guards, allowing for you to enter the
castle. Now enter the castle and stop that weapon.

35. Nabal Castle

Monsters: M.Scorp, SpearMan, Archer, Chopper

Items: SkullRG, Life2, MagicRG*, Cure*

*: You'll have to return here once the SlimeX is defeated to get these
items.

The main thing to do in this castle is to stop the weapon, and to
rescue the rest of Gant's prisoners. You need to find the path down
into the basement, and if you're in the area, push the switch to
create a bridge from the upper part to the lower part. In the basement
you'll have to fight the SlimeX.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: SlimeX

This boss has two phases to it, first it is three separate slimes,
which means that it gets three attacks per round, and once all three
are defeated, it becomes one large slime. Since it doesn't get a
second wind, I would assume the large slime is its second wind. Have
the Hero attack with the Flame Dragon, while having Karn and Ox
attack. The small slimes don't hit that hard, so have Nina use ATK-Up
on Karn and Ox first, then start using Fort on the rest of the team
healing as needed. After all three of the slimes are dropped, the huge
slime appears. Just attack with your strongest attack while healing in
between, and this troublesome boss will be wasted in a few rounds.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the Slime is defeated, you'll rescue the rest of the prisoner's
including Ox's wife who tells you what the secret weapon really is, a
torpedo set to destroy Prima. After a brief conversation, you'll end
up in Prima again. The Guild Owner there will tell you that you'll
need Wisdon's sorceresses' help (Wisdon=Wisdom maybe??) to defeat the
Dark Dragons. He'll then give you the statue which allows for you to
enter Wisdon. Remember that small moving town near Arad and the Krypt?
That's Wisdon, so warp back to Arad, and start your search for this
sorceress.

36. Wisdon

Monsters: Chopper, M.Scorp, R.Slime,

Items: Herbx2, ProSHx2, Lifex2, Life2, OldSP, SilverBR, RageHR,
ChainML, OldEgg

Upon first entering this town, it would be a good idea to save your
game because before you can talk to Bleu, you have to fight three
bosses in a row without a chance to rest or heal before the next fight
starts. Even though it looks like an ordinary town, you cannot enter
any of the buildings except the dragon shrine. Head downstairs and
pick up the items along the way, equipping any that are better than
what you currently have. After navigating your way through the lower
areas, you'll find a healing spring. Drink up here, and you'll soon
find three spirits which are protecting the sorceress. They say she
cannot be awakened until a true hero appears, and then they challenge
you. You'll have to fight all three without a rest in between fights.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Wisp

This first battle with the Wisp shouldn't be too hard. I think his HP
is the same as when you fought him in Agua, but now that you have much
better weapons and armor he won't be much of a challenge even though
he can hit everyone at once. You should be able to win this battle
without having to use any spells.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Cloud

After defeating the Wisp, you'll be challenged by the Cloud. He's a bit
easier now than he was before. You'll want to change into the Thunder
Dragon here, and perhaps use ATK-Up on Bo and Karn. Since he attacks
with only spells, using Shield on everyone might be a good idea too,
but it all depends on how long the battle lasts. If its short, its
more in your favor, if its long its more to the Cloud's favor. All
you'll need to do is hope he uses spells on individual members instead
of the 3.5 spell which hurts everyone. After defeating the Cloud, the
final and hardest spirit will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Myst

The Myst is the worst of the three spirits by far. He is much like the
Cloud attacking only with spells, and most of them hurt the entire
party. The Hero should use the Thunder Dragon, while Karn and Ox
attack. Nina should concentrate on using Shield on the party, reducing
the damage done to you by spells. After that, use ATK-Up on Ox and
Karn, and then use either the FlameRP or the RageHR as items in battle
to inflict more damage on the Myst than the E.Key alone. Just keep
your HP up and use multi-healing items such as Meat or WMeat to heal
your whole party. You'll also need to use the WtrJr if you have it
filled. If not, just keep each member healed enough to withstand a
spell or two before they can be healed. *If you revert Karn and the
Hero from their morphed forms, their HP will be low, but you can
remorph, and they'll receive a free heal for doing so. All you need to
do is keep after the Myst, and he'll be defeated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you defeat the three spirits they'll wake up Bleu for you, in a
rather interesting way if I do say so myself. She'll then give you the
OldEgg, and tells you to drop it in a very warm place. She then goes
back to sleep for now at least. Now head back to Prima, and then head
north to the underwater volcano.

37. Ocean Volcano

Monsters: Dogfish, AmeblobX, CrawlerX, Tentacle,

Items: Herb, M.Drop, SharpBW, 3000 GP, 2000 GP, PowerDR

There isn't a whole lot to do down here, except collect the treasure
boxes. One of them has the SharpBW in it, one of two one handed bows
in the game, allowing for Bo to use a shield. This will help his
defense, but since he'll be fused with Karn, I don't know if the extra
defense will help him or not. At any rate, you must head down into the
volcano, where you'll find a large crack in the ground and lava below.
Drop the OldEgg down in there, and you'll automatically end up in
Wisdon, with Bleu. She'll then join your party. Now you'll end up back
in Prima, and wait for the Dark Dragons to attack. You'll then get a
ride on one of the big fish, and you'll surface to see what's going
on, only to be surrounded by the Dark Dragons ships. Then the egg you
dropped into the volcano turns into a typhoon bug and eliminates three
of the six ships. They'll then retreat, and take the fight below. Here
you'll regain the control of your party, and you'll need to set up
again. I typically take the Hero, Karn, Nina and Bleu for the boss
fight, but if you feel really confident, you can change Nina with Ox.
Remember you can change one member per round while fighting, so just
switch if things aren't going as planned. After you set up your party,
head north and talk to the Knight looking guy. He'll change into a
boss and attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Pincher

This is another boss who is weak to Thunder attacks, so knowing this
set your party up with those that can use these attacks, which will
mostly be the Hero and Bleu. I always use Shin, which eliminates Bo
from attacking, but I think its worth the trade. Have the Hero use
Thunder Dragon, Karn should attack, and have Nina use Fort and Shield
on everyone then ATK-Up on Karn, while having Bleu use Fry. He has
spells that can hit the whole party, so it might be best to use Shield
first. If you have any Mrbl1's use them here. Just keep using the Fry
spell and keep the rest of your party in good health, and he'll be
gone in a few rounds of fighting. If he defeats you, you may want to
try to go into the fight without Karn morphed as Shin, and take Bo
just to add an extra 120 damage with his Fry spell. If you took Ox
instead of Nina, just have him attack, and if you don't have Shin, and
take Gobi, have him use the highest spell he has, and if you take Karn
unmorphed, use any Stones you might have, or have him use the RageHR
or FlameRP if you have them still.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After he's defeated, he'll threaten to take you all down with him. The
fish members seem to think he's bluffing, but in the end he's not.
Maybe its a good thing they pushed him around a little because it
moves him a little ways away from Prima. After he's wasted, you'll end
up back in Prima again. The Guild Owner thanks you for your help, and
after another pointless conversation about Gobi wanting his money
again. Then you'll be back outside of Prima and Gobi will make a
comment about forgetting something. For once he's actually right, so
head back to Prima, and visit the Prima Guild again. You'll get the
sphere, which will allow for Gobi to change into a big fish too. Now
with this ability, you'll first need to find Tunlan, for a very big
reason, and then you'll need to find Gust. I won't give away the exact
locations, but you'll have to swim across that big chasm with Gobi,
and you won't get attacked so that's why I'm not telling. All you need
to look for are the bottoms of the beaches to get out of the water
from, and both the paths to Tunlan and Gust are pretty straight 
forward. A little hint about finding Gust, you'll know you're on the
right path when you come across one of the closed doors with the
Dragon-looking Symbol on it, and the enemies suddenly become stronger.
And a small hint for finding Tunlan, look for a small island to
dismount to, and you'll be right under it.

Since this is your first time in Tunlan, there is nothing to do in this
town because you can't understand anyone here. They use music for
their language, and therefore you have no musical instruments, and
can't talk to or understand them. For now head up to the castle, and
go upstairs, and you should come to a locked door. Nothing will open
this door at this time, so walk to the left of it and try to get the
box. Then one of the statues will come to life and push you down the
hole. You should then be in a room with two people running around in
it. Talk to the old man, and he'll tell you about getting the big
catch, take what's under the box. Move the box closest to the bed, and
get the Rod5. You will need this item to fish up the DragonSD, and
DragonAR, both of which are needed for future dragon trainings. You'll
need to push another box in the lower left part of the screen to find
a hole to get out. This is rather funny, but the first time I played
BOF, I thought he was talking about the big catch being able to get
out of the room. It took me forever to figure out it was the Rod5 he
was talking about. You can't catch the Dragon items without the Rod5,
so you'll need to have this item. Remember that left path from the
Dark Dragon fortress? Warp Back to Romero, and have Bo, or Shin lead,
and head all west. Make sure you have some fishing bait when you do,
but keep heading that direction, and you'll end up at a well. Equip
the Rod5 with your Hero and equip some bait, and set him to the lead,
and fish in the well. You should pull out the DragonSD. If you don't
just try again. Now you can head to the Dragon Training Shrine to the
left of the Dark Dragon fortress, and undertake the second training.
Again this is one on one, but you have the dragon attacks to use on
the boss this time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Bain

Start off this fight by turning into the Thunder Dragon. Use the Mrbl2
you just found in the box, to cause 260 damage to him. You may need to
use herbs or cures to heal in this fight, but its not a big deal if
you have to. Or as I mentioned above, you can simply sacrifice a turn
when your hp is getting low but enough to survive an attack, return to
the Hero's normal form, then use Thunder Dragon again, and you'll be
fully healed. Bain doesn't have a second wind, so you just need to
bring his HP down the first time. He gets the first attack, so just
make sure you heal before hand.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Bain, you'll gain the use of four new dragons which
cause the following damage:

Ice Dragon: 190 damage on all enemies/380 on slam, 285 on enemy weak vs
ice, 570 on slam
Fire Dragon: 210 damage on all enemies/420 on slam, 315 on enemy weak
vs fire, 630 on slam
Bolt Dragon: 225 damage on all enemies/450 on slam, 337 on enemy weak
vs thunder, 674 on slam
Gold Dragon: 375 damage on all zombies, 750 on slam, 0 damage on non-
zombie creatures

Now you should get back to undertake the quest to find the town of Gust
and what lies in wait for you.

39. Gust

Monsters (Outside): M.Scorp, Chimera, Warlock, Zombie

Items: Sash

Inn: 80GP

Item Shop:
[Herb       10GP]
[Antdt      15GP]
[T.Drop     20GP]
[Acorn      30GP]
[Acrn x9   270GP]
[Charm     150GP]
[Mrbl1    1000GP]
[Cure     2000GP]

Weapon Shop:
[Tri-DR     4000GP]
[OldSP      6000GP]
[WindRP     7000GP]
[MoonBW     8000GP]
[WingSD    10000GP]
[GaiaMask   8000GP]
[FlameSH   12000GP]
[WorldML   22000GP]

Upon first entering Gust, you'll notice that everyone is acting very
strange indeed. A person in town mentions that everyone acts even
stranger when the wind blows in from the north, meaning that the cause
of all these problems might be coming from that direction. Before
heading in that direction, be sure to rest at the Inn and perhaps
upgrade your equipment as needed and save your game. Also in one of
houses, there is a box that you can push to fall through a hole. This
leads to another one of Karn's morph spells. After falling through,
you'll find six barrels set up like this:

|---(1)(2)(3)--|
|   (4)   (5)  |
|      (6)     |

Well anyway here's the idea. You should push barrel 6 either to the
left or right like this:

|---(1)(2)(3)--|
|   (4)   (5)  |
|         (6)  |

Now push barrel 5 right and barrel 4 left like this:

|---(1)(2)(3)--|
| (4)       (5)|
|        (6)   |

Now push barrels 1 and 3 up and then push barrel 2 either left or right
like this:

    (1)  (3)
|---(2)     --|
| (4)      (5)|
         (6)

Now just head up through the open path, and make sure Karn is
unmorphed. Have him talk to the wise man, and he'll learn the morph
spell Debo. I don't know if this spell is any good, since it can only
be used underwater, but you're done with the underwater parts and
won't need to go back down there again. Perhaps someone goofed while
programming the game, making you get this spell later rather than
earlier??

After you're finished, head up the stairs, and it will take you out of
town completely. Now head back into town, and head out the northern
exit and keep heading north.

40. Northern Fortress

Monsters: Rogue, Blaze, Mimic, Buzzer, LancerX, Roach, K.Roach, Warlock
D.Knight, RugaX

Items: Herbx2, L.Potion, Cure2, Rod4, M.Cura

The first part of the fortress is pretty easy, but some annoying Rogues
guard all of the treasure boxes. Just kill them off using your weapons
since they get hurt pretty good from weapons, and they aren't bad for
exp. You can use Ox to break down the walls if you'd like but all it
does is saves you a little time from walking all the way around just
to get to the back of the fortress. After reaching the back of the
first area, Cort will appear and test out a new formula of his one
you. It shrinks you to a small size, and now you have to find a small
hole in the upper right part of the room and head there. The hole is
actually a mouse hole, and it seems that the mice down there are
fighting the roaches for food. You need to talk to all the mice, and
the one blocking the path to the north will move. Head to the north,
then fight the roaches near the food supply.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: K.Roach x3

These three aren't too tough to handle. Just attack them individually,
and they can be hurt by weapons, and the Hero might be able to do more
damage to one with his weapon over his dragon spells. Have Nina just
use ATK-Up on everyone, since all the characters will inflict over 100
damage. They do get the first attacks, but don't hit very hard alone,
but can quickly drop one characters HP if they all attack at once.
Just have Nina keep the party healed up, and you should come out a
winner. Karn if he's morphed can do 999 to a single roach, causing it
to enter its second wind after one hit. No matter what party you use
here, all members should just attack, and put in Nina if you haven't
already, just switch her in with someone, and heal as needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the roaches, head back to where the mice were at.
They'll thank you for helping them, and give you the Mouse Cura. After
picking that up, you'll automatically head back to the room where Cort
shrunk you, and the M.Cura will reverse the affects of his potion,
returning you to your normal size. Proceed down the stairs and
continue through the Fortress. Down below, just move along the
floating  platforms until you reach the end where Cort is. He'll then
put you against RugaX.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: RugaX

Unfortunately, RugaX isn't as weak to weapons as the regular Rogues were
that you fought earlier. You should have the Hero morph into the Bolt
Dragon. If you have Karn as Shin, just have him attack. If you have
Gobi or Ox, have those two attack, and if you are using Bo, use Fry on
him. Have Bleu use her highest attack spell (highest doesn't always
mean the most damage so you may have to experiment) and have Nina use
Fort on the party and heal. ATK-Up probably wouldn't be a bad idea
either, but make sure you get your defense set up before you go to
offense. Ruga doesn't have a second wind, so just keep at him till he
goes down.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cort will tell you that his flower will do you all in after you defeat
RugaX, and then it appears that the RugaX was actually a person who
was changed into a monster. Then a rather funny scene between Bleu and
Nina happens while the Hero and Ox take Nicholie back to the village.
Back in the village, Bleu attempts to heal Nicholie, but she needs the
Oil to do so. Your next quest is to find some oil.

41. Frog Cave

Items: G.Fly, Oil, Maestro

After Bleu chases you out of Gust, head back in. There is a small cave
on the left side of town and there is a fly inside it. Before fighting
the G.Fly, head back to the Inn to rest, then it might be a good idea
to save your game too. Then head back to the cave and fight the fly.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: G.Fly

The G.Fly can be a little bit tough, he attacks fast, and when I fought
him, I was slammed at least four times. If you have Karn morphed,
you'll once again have only four party members to use here again. Have
the Hero use Bolt Dragon, Karn and Ox attack, and have Nina use ATK-Up
and Fort on the rest of the party. She should also heal when needed.
If you choose to have Karn unmorphed which is a bad idea here, but IF
you use Gobi he can't use his spells so just have him attack, and have
Bo attack and if he does less than 80 points of damage, have him use
Fry. Just keep hitting the G.Fly with your best attacks, and then
he'll be defeated, and you can take it as an item. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After taking the G.Fly, you need to head back underwater, and find the
Frog Cave, which could be seen from the Nabal Fortress. The Cave is
located where a small beach is blocked off from walking by large
underwater rocks, so you'll have to use the Big Fish to swim over
them. Once you're at the cave, give the King Frog the G.Fly and he'll
give you the Oil. Now head back to Gust and give the Oil to Bleu.
After giving the Oil to Bleu she uses it on Nicholie, and tells you to
get rid of that flower. Now head to the north and dispose of the
madness flower.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: FlowerX

The FlowerX isn't as tough as it looks. To defeat it, have the Hero use
Bolt Dragon, Karn and Ox should attack, and Nina should use Fort and
ATK-Up on everyone. The FlowerX attacks mostly but will occasionally
use a Poison spell, which is nothing more than annoying. Its rather
slow giving you a chance to heal later than earlier. You should still
watch your HP, since a boss can get a slam just like your characters,
just not as often though. If you didn't have Karn morphed into Shin,
then all Gobi can do is attack, and Bo like on the G.Fly if he causes
less than 80 damage, have him use Fry. The FlowerX isn't much harder
during its second wind, and just repeat the process over until it
dies, healing as needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating the FlowerX, head back to Gust, and it seems that
everyone has returned to normal, almost. Now would be a good time to
get the Maestro from the old man who makes the flutes before you leave
Gust and forget it. Talk to him twice, then he says that the flute is
under his bed. Head into his bed and look to the north, and search, and
you'll find the flute. Now it seems that Nicholie has turned into
RugaX again, and is running amuck in the house instead of healing. You
have no choice but to defeat him again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: RugaX Second Fight

This fight is almost the same as before. Just have the Hero use Bolt
Dragon, have Karn and Ox attack and have Nina aide them with the same
spells she did before and then heal as required by the party. If you
have Gobi, his only use is to attack, and have Bo attack RugaX and if
he can't do much damage, just have him use Fry or any combat items you
have that can be used. Just keep working on him, and he'll go down
without much of a fight at all. The only thing you really have to
worry about while fighting him is the way that the party is arranged
to being the fight. I had it like this, Hero, Nina, Gobi, Karn. I
don't know if its like that all the time or if its random, but just
switch Gobi with Ox, and have Karn Morph on the first round.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating RugaX again, Bleu will attempt to return Nicholie to
himself again. At first it doesn't seem to be working but then it
finally works. He thanks you for saving him, and offers to repair the
bridge leading west from Gust. After the automatic resting from the
game, head back up towards the bridge, and you'll find that its fixed,
but Nicholie is down yet again. Now Cort will appear and it seems that
he's not too happy with you for messing up his plans. He then changes
into a monster and attacks you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: HornToad

Now this is the type of boss I like but hate at the same time. The part
I like is that he's the first boss in a long while, maybe since the
Gremlin that actually puts up a good fight. The part that I hate is
that sometimes he puts up too good of a fight and gets a lot of slams
and can make quick work of your team. To start this fight, have the
Hero use Bolt Dragon while having Karn attack. I also have Nina here,
so have her use Fort on everyone because this boss can slam a lot, and
the damage reduction is nice indeed. If you have Gobi and just normal
Karn, have them attack or use any combat stones or items that you
have. Have Ox attack since that's basically the only thing that he can
do. If you have, Bleu use the most damaging spell that she has learned
to this point. The HornToad isn't too tough until he gets his second
wind, and can start hitting the whole party at once. Just watch the
amount of damage that he causes, and heal any members that get below
that amount first before healing those who are above it. You may need
to use your WtrJr here, but with Bleu and her exit spell, going there
and getting out shouldn't be too much of a problem. Just keep healing
your party, and use any multi-healing items you may have such as Meat
or WMeat, and you should come out a winner.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Cort, cross the bridge and head off to the west towards
your next stop Gramor.

42. Gramor

Items: Cowl

Gramor is a town below the surface, but then again its the home to the
mole tribe. It seems that Mogu is having a very bad dream and can't
awaken from it. The moles there ask you for help. If you agree to help
them, you'll receive the Cowl. With this and the Maestro from Gust,
you'll be able to understand the people in Tunlan, and you should
return there, now that you can understand them, and get the item from
there that the mole people asked you to retrieve.

43. Tunlan Again

Items: Bolster, M.Drop, Melonx2

If you weren't here before and want to view the shops status and such,
please refer to #38.

Upon arriving at Tunlan, it seems that this place has a problem of its
own, (gee isn't this getting repetitive already??) and that problem is
that the Princess of Tunlan wants to give that country's treasure the
TmKey to the Dark Dragons so that she can remain young forever. First
head to the castle and talk to the old woman in green. She'll tell you
about the problem, and if you can help her, she'll give you the
Bolster, which allows you to enter people's dreams. Talk to the
Princess, and she refuses to give you the TmKey. Now head back
downstairs, and talk to the old woman again. She then says she has to
get the key back before the Princess gives it away, and will do it by
force if needed. She then tells you about how to open that safe. She
mentions that the Princess has some strange marks on her back, and
they show how to open the safe. She then tells you she likes to swim
at night, and we should sneak in at night, and have a look for
ourselves. Head out of Tunlan, and use the DkKey or HrGlas or just
wait until nightfall. Now head back into the castle, and go up to
where the Princess' room is at. You need to be back where those trees
are, and there you can have a look. After seeing the marks, head back
down to the safe. There you'll need to open the left side first, then
the right, but since you saw them in the pool, it was a reflection and
it was backwards. The Princess then comes along and a big fight breaks
out. After that Cerl comes and takes the TmKey away. Now with all the
walls down, you can now go back to the safe room, get the rest of the
items along with the Bolster, and return to Gramor.

44. Dream World

This is one messed up place to say the least, with a few things to do
while you're here. The first to do, is head to the north tower, but
first you may want to talk to everyone in the town to find out what's
happening here. After you're finished, head to the tower in the
northern part of the world. In the tower, there are blue and red
switches all around on the floor. If you step on a blue one, all the
backgrounds will disappear, and you can't tell where you're going. To
restore the background, you need to find a red switch. You'll just
need to feel through the walls, and what I mean by this is walk in one
direction, say north, but try to go east/west each time you take a
step to the north, to find passages when the background is gone.
You'll have to fight Mothro but until you get Mogu to join you, Mothro
can't be touched. To find Mothro on the first floor, first head to the
north, stepping on the blue switch, killing off the background. Then
head three steps to the right, and step on the red switch and restore
the background. From there head along the path, following it all east,
then north, to just below the blue switch and head left at the
intersection. Then head all south, and follow the path, and you'll
soon hit a blue switch. From here walk about 19 steps to the left, and
then you should be able to walk north. From here, walk 5 steps to the
north, then you should be able to walk to the east again. From here,
just follow the one way path, and you'll soon come to Mothro. He'll
challenge you, but no matter what you do, you can't touch him. After
the fight starts flee and then exit out of the tower. Head back to the
town where you started, and it will appear that someone found out
where Mogu's courage is at. That place is in a cave to the south which
can now be reached now that the bridge is fixed. Rest at the inn and
save your game, and once you're ready, head to that cave.

Gas Field:

Items: HeadGear, Life, LightSH

Before reaching the cave, you'll come to a small area with columns of
poison gas blowing out of the ground here. If you make a wrong step,
you'll get hit with a gas column that you can't see as a way for the
game keeping this a one way only to get through it. You'll know if you
come to a dead end if you get hit three times, one for each direction
you want to go. At the beginning if you stick close to edges of the
screen you should be ok. This technique soon becomes obsolete when you
reach the bigger areas. After working your way through the Gas Field,
you'll come to the South Cave, where Mogu's Courage is. His other
attributes will join you in here, and they will make Mogu complete,
and then he'll join your party. Now you must head back through the Gas
Field, and go back to the North Tower.

North Tower:

Follow the path I mentioned above to where Mothro is at, and he sees
that you have courage and retreats further up into the tower. Follow
him up there, and you'll find more of the same with the blue and red
switches. Just follow the directions here, and you should be able to
reach Mothro without much trouble. On the second floor to start out
with, there isn't much of a path to follow, just keep going till you
reach the first blue switch. From here head, all north, then all west
and simply follow the one way path till you reach a red switch. From
there, head south till there is a small intersection leading to the
east, and then follow that path until there is an intersection leading
to the west, and you should follow that one till it leads you to the
stairs leading to the third floor. On the third floor, follow the path
until you hit a blue switch that can't been seen because of the
background. From that switch follow the path until you can see three
blue switches with a red one below hit. If you want to see where you
stand, go down and step on the red switch. Be careful about heading
too far down, or you'll fall out of the tower and you'll have to start
over. From the red switch, head 5 north, then you can head to the
east. Head to the east about 4 steps, then start heading north again
for about 3 steps, then head east again, this time about 3 steps.
You'll need to head north from here about 3 steps, then head off to
the east into a passage you can't see. Now all you'll need to do is
follow this passage, and you'll soon come to the stairs to the fourth
floor. The fourth floor is easy, just follow the path across the blue
and red switches, and you'll soon fight Mothro.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Mothro

Mothro is already way down on his HP, but don't let this fact lead you
to believe that he'll go down easily. He has a very high evade rate,
and he can even avoid your dragon attacks and just about everything
else. To start off, have the Hero use Bolt Dragon, while having Karn
and Ox if you're using him attack, while having Bleu use her highest
level spells on him. Nina should have FortX by now, and if not, just
use Fort on everyone individually, then use ATK-Up on Karn, and Ox if
you have him in your party. If you're using Gobi, have him attack and
if you have Bo, use Fry with him. Now that you're set, you just need
to pray that Mothro doesn't avoid all your attacks round in and round
out. If you need to, have Nina heal you as it is required, otherwise
have her attack and use any combat items that you have. With any luck,
Mothro shouldn't last more than a few rounds. I didn't notice Mothro
using any physical attacks, but he did use some weak spells like Stop
and Poison, with an occasional attempt at Rub here and there.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you defeat Mothro, you'll be teleported out of the Dream World,
and you'll be back in Gramor. Mogu will now awaken, and he'll rejoin
your party again. Now that you have him, it might be a good idea to
revisit some areas that you can now access with Mogu before you
proceed any father.

45. Extra Things to do Part III

Now that you have Mogu and he can dig, you should return to some older
areas where there are marks on the ground that only Mogu can enter.
Your first stop should be back in Camlon. You'll have to walk along
the path towards where Nanai was, but head to the north after crossing
the bridge. You'll find a dig spot, and have Mogu dig and you'll fall
through to a room below. In that room, have Karn lead your party, and
he'll learn the Doof spell, which allows for you to move those large
dressers. After learning the spell, head to Tantar. From Tantar, head
north to the area where the Giant Robot was at. In an area off to the
right, you'll see another digging spot. Have Mogu dig and fall through
the hole, and then switch to Karn to disarm the traps on all of the
treasure boxes. Pick up the A.Potion, V.Potion, Clog, and the L.Potion
and then head back to Bleak. In one of the houses in Bleak, there is a
large dresser, and two jars with stairs heading down. Have Karn use
Doof, and he can move those large dressers. Move it so you can head
downstairs. Downstairs, move the two barrels and them head up and move
the large dresser and search under it for the ClearCL. You might want
to equip Nina or Bleu with this, they're the only ones that can equip
it, and an item with 100 defense is rare. Now head back upstairs and
move the other large dresser in the upper portion of the room. Move
that, then have Karn revert back to normal and talk to the old man
there, and you'll learn his fourth and final transformation, Puka. Now
head back to Auria. With Karn leading, have him morph into Puka. At
the Dragon Emblem on the mountain outside Auria, stand right in front
of it with Karn leading and use the 'A' button. The seal will move,
and then enter the cave for a Dark Bracelet. It took me quite a while
to figure out how to do this, and you can miss out on some good items
inside it. Now head back to Gust again. From Gust, walk back down
towards the beach that you first arrived on in that area, and you'll
come to another seal to be moved. Inside you'll find a Love Bracelet
which restores 1 HP for every step the wearer takes. Your final stop
should be back at Gramor, since you need to head in that direction
anyway. You'll see some strange trees or something growing out of the
ground. Have Mogu dig there, and you'll come away with the Root, a key
item that you'll need for later. Its best just to dig it up now
because its along the way to your next stop. With all of this done,
you can continue your journey to Spring.

46. Spring

Items: Herb, Clog

Inn: 100 GP

Item Shop:
[Herb       10GP]
[Antdt      15GP]
[T.Drop     20GP]

[IronML     5000GP]
[SpineCL    8000GP]
[GaiaMask   8000GP]
[QuartzAR  10000GP]

There isn't much to do in Spring while the town is frozen over. Make
sure you pick up the Herb and Clog in town, and upgrade your equipment
if you have the money and if its better than what you already have.
You're main goal now is to head to Spyre Tower where the weather
control machine is located. Spyre is located to the southwest of
Spring. Head to the tower and have Mogu dig and you'll enter the lower
levels of the tower.

47. Spyre Tower

Items: Cure2, FlameAR, Shell, WorldAR, A.Potion

The bottom floors of the tower are pretty straight forward. Just follow
the path on the first floor and collect all the items along the way.
The next part of the tower is what I like to call the floors of
nature. On the first floor, the room is covered in grass, and the exit
is in the upper right part of the screen. The weather on the next
floor is nothing but rain, and the exit to the next floor is in the
lower left part of the screen. The next floor is nothing but desert
while the exit to the floor above is located in the lower right part
of the screen. The floor above is covered in snow just like Spring,
and the exit is located in the upper right hand corner of the room.
The next floor is almost like walking on the sky itself, and the exit
to the final floor is off in the lower left corner of that room. On
the final floor the place you need to head to is in the upper right
corner of the screen. Just search the pillar, and Mote will appear and
throw you into another Dream World.

48. Second Dream World

Items: Cure, L.Potion, JadeBW, Trident, CursedHT, Smoke, FaceMask

After arriving here, you'll be in a small village with nothing to do in
it except buy some items, stay at the Inn, and save your game. Your
first goal should be to head to a cave to the north of this town, and
it may take a little bit of walking to reach. You'll need to head
south and then follow the path from there, and back track to the
north. You'll reach a small cave right below the tower and then enter
this cave.  The first floor is fairly easy, but you could end up at a
dead end if you explore a little. If that's the case, just head back
up, and then just walk back the way you came from. On the second
floor, you'll find a small room with four treasure boxes in it. After
getting the boxes, a gate will close behind you forcing you to fall
into the hole to get out. If you wandered here to the dead end from
the first floor, you'll know right where you're at. Just follow the
path back to the second floor again. Don't go back to where the boxes
were this time, and just keep going. On the third floor, you'll find
three treasure boxes, and just follow the short path, and you'll come
across Mote's Conscience, and he'll break down the wall allowing for
passage to the north. Beyond that point, you'll be in what I think is
the worse maze in the game. It doesn't look so bad at first, but once
the room starts spinning, you'll think otherwise. Its not hard to keep
your eye on what direction you want to go, but there isn't much
viewing room, and what you can see, the screen just extends far enough
so every direction looks the same, making it hard to decide which way
to go. Hopefully I've marked this correctly, and it will allow for a
quick passage through here. From the first switch, head to the left,
and follow the path to the next switch.  Now follow the path to the
south, and you'll soon come to another switch. From this switch head
to the north, and you should come upon the fourth switch. Step on that
switch, and after the room stops spinning follow the path to the east,
and take the first south, and then continue to the east, and follow
that path till it branches south again, and then head south and you'll
come to yet another switch. Step on that switch and make the room spin
again, then head to the left. Keep going left and then you'll come to
another switch. After the room is done spinning, head to the left
again. Keep going left until you come to the second north. Follow that
path, and you should come to the final teleport. Follow the path to
the left, then you'll find the teleport out of this maze. In the next
room, it looks rather complicated, but it really isn't. Just follow
the path, and take the middle staircase. From there you'll be in a
room with a lot of damage tiles in it. Walk across the tiles, and then
look in the lower right hand corner of the room for a pit to fall in.
Fall down the holes, and then follow the path and take the stairs
leading up. On the fourth floor, you'll be in a room with a lot of
purple damage tiles, and stairs leading up in the lower left hand
corner of the room. Have Karn lead your party, so if you happen to
come across one of the holes, you won't fall down right away. Make
your way to the stairs and go up them. You should now be in a room with
5 different staircases in it. Take the rightmost and lowest staircase
and then you'll fight Mote. He can't be defeated until his Conscience
shows up, so try not to avoid burning too much AP fighting him till
then.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Mote

Mote isn't really tough, but he can be hard to take down. At times he
is only hurt by magic, and then he can only be hurt by weapons. How he
looks determines what he will be hurt by. Have the Hero use the Bolt
Dragon, have Karn attack, and have Nina use FortX and ATK-Up on your
party and you'll need to have Bleu to use magic to make Mote weak to
weapons again. If he's hit with a weapon, he'll gain resistances to
weapons and weakness to magic. If he's hit with magic, he'll gain
resistance to magic, and weakness to weapons. Your Dragon attack goes
as magic, so if you use this party, things should work find. Have Karn
attack, making him weak to magic, then Bleu should use a spell making
Mote weak to weapons again. The Hero should then get in an attack, and
Mote should be weak enough to get a full damage affect out of it. Nina
should attack with her weapon, and heal as needed. Just watch Mote's
pattern, and you should be able to defeat him. If not, just try again,
and/or try to gain some levels. If you don't have Karn Morphed, have
Gobi, Karn and Ox attack, while having Bo use magic to mess up Mote's
weapon defense. While Mote's form is blurred, he is weak to weapons,
and when his form becomes recognizable, he is going to be weak to
magic attacks, so you can keep track of what is he weak to or strong
to.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Mote, you'll be teleported back to the Spyre Tower,
where Mote teleported you into the Dream World. Now you can search the
pillar and get the SkyKey. Now take the SkyKey to the machine to the
left, and use it. Now the weather in Spring will be normal, and now
head back there. There is a hidden cave in the waterfall, which was
frozen and you couldn't enter it but now the water is flowing again,
and now you can continue your journey through here to Carmen. Before
leaving, you should go fishing where the ducks are swimming at, and you
can catch the DragonAR there, which is required for your next dragon
training session, which will be able to so shortly.

49. Carmen

Items: RubyBR, W-Ant

When you first arrive at Carmen, time itself is stopped. There is only
one person here who can move, and he mentions that there is a tower
off to the southeast named Tock, and perhaps something has happened
there. Now head off in the direction of Tock. Before arriving at Tock,
there are a few items that you should take this chance to pick up. The
first is the HeroBW, which is Bo's best weapon. To find it, walk past
the Tock Tower, and then follow the path to the north. You'll soon
come to a dig spot. Have Mogu dig, and then go down the hole. I don't
recall if the box is trapped, but put Karn in the lead just to make
sure. After picking up the HeroBW, head back south a little, and
you'll find a Dragon Emblem room, that you'll have to open with Karn
using Puka. Go inside, and pick up the Wind Bracelet inside. Now head
back to Tock and proceed with the game.

50. Tock Tower

Items: Cure, G.Tiara, EvilCN, GuardSH, WolfSkin, Life2, AgileHT, Life,
IcyAR

This tower isn't too long, except there are teleporting arrows
everywhere, making for some slow navigation up to the top of the tower.
There are quite a few items to be found here, so you might want to see
if you can't collect them all. On the third floor, there is nothing
but a room full of arrows. You'll just need to watch where the arrows
point and if the arrows overlap say something like this:

-----
| | |
| | |
|\ /|
-----

-----
|   |
|==>|
|   |
-----

You need to forget this crude size of this example, but its all that I
had to work with. If you step on the arrow heading down you'll bypass
the arrow pointing left. You'll need to take advantage of this while
trying to get to the final set of stairs leading up. At the top of the
tower you'll find Cerl who shows off the power of the TmKey, and it
causes some problems with time and space, and then it kicks your party
out of the tower. Your Hero will then be by himself which can be good
and bad at the same time. He can gain loads of exp. but he has no one
to help him fight. If you're defeated, you'll automatically end up back
in Carmen. Your goal here is to head back to Carmen. It appears that
Alan and Cerl know each other, and Alan tells you that she won't help
the Dark Dragons, and then he takes off to Tock. You must head there
once again. At the top of the tower again, Alan will try to talk to
Cerl, but she injures him and then attacks your party. This really
isn't a boss fight because you can't defeat her, and after a while the
battle will end, and then she'll use the TmKey and kick you all out of
the tower. This time the Hero and Nina will be all along outside. Just
have Nina use Warp and go back to Carmen. After more talking, Alan
will tell you about why he thinks that Cerl turned out the way that
she did, and he takes some of the blame for that. He'll tell you about
the fruit, and she might remember that. You must now head to the big
tree that can be seen on the route to Tock. Head down that way, and
have Ox punch the tree to get the fruit. With the Fruit in hand, head
off to the fortress beyond the path running to the east. Cerl will
then let her guard down and you can enter the fortress. She'll tell
you that she hurt Alan and he'll never forgive her, and says that if
you want to defeat her, she won't resist this time. It is then that
Goda appears and tries to take the TmKey. Cerl will then tell you to
take the key and leave. You'll then be outside the fortress, and Alan
will then get into the fortress, just as the time begins to distort
again. With the TmKey in hand, you'll automatically be at the final
stairway leading up in Tock. Head up to the machine where the key
goes, and Nina will try to put it in, and then things will mess up
once again there. Nina is pulled into the void I guess I could call
it, and then you're party will be outside Tunlan. Head inside and
you'll find someone who looks like Nina but she's wearing blue instead
of pink. It appears that she is suffering from amnesia, and then near
the exit, there's a strange cloaked person who tells you there is a
famous doctor in Carmen who can help Nina. Now head back to Carmen and
see this doctor. You'll need a C.Nut for the Tonic, and you might as
well have Ox punch one of the trees outside Tunlan before warping to
Carmen to see the doctor.

51. Carmen w/ Time Restored

Items: Tonic (Look above to see if you missed the others.)

Inn: 80 GP

Item Shop: None

Weapon Shop:
[Tri-BW    12000GP]
[IcyCW     15000GP]
[FlameSD   20000GP]
[LoyalRP   25000GP]
[WorldAR   12000GP]
[PowerHT   20000GP]
[MystSH    20000GP]
[LightCL   30000GP]

Now that time has been restored in Carmen, it might be a wise idea to
do your final weapon and armor upgrades that can be bought. Don't
spare a dime while upgrading here, its the best equipment that you'll
be able to use for a while till you find some of the better stuff near
the end of the game. Now you'll have to find this doctor so he can
help Nina. He tells you its easy to do, he just needs some
ingredients. The Root, C.Nut and W.Ant you should already have if you
read the walkthrough. If not the Root is found by the plant outside
Gramor, a W.Ant is probably the rarest item, and if you have used all
of them found throughout the game, go buy some Mrbl3's and go to a
place where the enemies are weak and kill them until a white deer
shows up. Use your Mrbl3 and have Shin shoot arrows at it till you
kill it then get your W.Ant from it. The C.Nut can be found at Tunlan,
just have Ox punch the trees. The P.Fish is the one that takes the
longest to get. You'll need to go back to the fortress where Cerl and
Alan were last at, and witness the scenes there, and then continue
with the game. You just need to follow the path, but stay on the path
or you'll take damage from the poison on the ground. Just keep walking
and you'll come to a broken bridge. Fish with the Hero here, and pull
out the P.Fish. Now that you have all four items needed for the Tonic,
head back to Carmen and talk to the doctor. He'll give you the Tonic,
and now you should warp back to Tunlan and give the Tonic to Nina.
After using the Tonic on her, she'll regain her memory. While she's
older now, she still remembers you and your party like nothing has
happened. She now has the ability to fly, and it would be a good idea
to use her new ability to get retrieve some items and fly to the next
place where the hero can receive his dragon training.

52. Extra Things to do Part IV

This is the final part for the extras that can be done, but the last
wait is always the best. Now that Nina can fly there are several
places to visit that you couldn't before. Your first stop should be to
the well way south of Arad. Have the Hero fish here, and you'll pull
out the Dragon Helmet. Now warp to Gramor, and then fly west. You
should soon find a well in the middle of the mountains. Have the Hero
fish here, and you'll get the Dragon Shield out. Now fly to the castle
in the middle of the lake that can be seen from Gust. This is the
final dragon training shrine. Again its a one on one fight alone with
the Hero, but if you have all the Dragon equipment the Avian shouldn't
be too tough to kill.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Avian

This boss shouldn't be too hard to kill. Just change into the Bolt
Dragon, and use Mrbl1's the whole fight, and he'll go down fast. If
you need to, just use a Cure to heal up, and you should be fine. Just
be aware, that he will get the first attack, and can slam often. If he
over whelms you and defeats you, it might be a good idea to try to
earn a few more levels. Just keep after him and you should win with a
few tries.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating him, you'll gain the ability to change into Rudra which
can inflict 320 damage on all enemies and 640 damage on a slam while
inflicting 480 damage normally and 960 damage on enemies weak to
lightning. The effort was well worth it. Next head to the cave where
the Cleansing Water was. Head down to where the water is and you'll
find a building below the water. Here if the Hero has all the Dragon
equipment, and all three training sessions completed he'll learn the
ultimate Dragon spell Agni, which will inflict 999 damage per hit
regardless of the enemy and whether its a slam or not. Next you should
warp back to Romero. Fly a little to the north, and you'll see what
looks like a tower that is underground. Search behind that building,
and pick up the Tri-Rang which is better and lighter than the Dragon
Sword. Next you should head south of Scande and you'll find a place
for Mogu to dig at. Inside this place, you'll find a LoveHT, MystCW,
StarSH, S.Potion, A.Potion, L.Potion, Life2 and AgileHT. Next head to
Romero, and you'll find a digging spot on an island to the northeast
of Romero. Inside you'll find three treasure boxes which have a
S.Potion, V.Potion and a Sash. It would be best to have Karn with you
and have him disarm the traps. Now that you have all the items, that
can be obtained on the world map, head back to Carmen. You'll find that
strange cloaked guy again, and he'll tell you to search where he's at.
Do this and obtain the Pass. Now head towards Scande, which lies to
the south of Carmen.

53. Scande

Items: Glove, PowerHT, IcyCN, Mrbl1, Cure

It seems that you can't enter Scande Tower yet. The elevator in Scande
is broken, and a man near it says that someone from Spring has climbed
the tower. Now Warp back to Spring, and talk to him in one of the
houses, and get the B.Part. Now Warp back to Gant, and have the man
there fix the B.Part. He'll fix the parts and then you'll get the
Parts. Now head back to Scande and put the parts in the elevator and
take it up. At the top, you'll find the cloaked man again. He'll tell
you that you need a powerful weapon to defeat Zog called the D.Hrt.
Now head back to Tunlan. In one of the houses there, someone will use
the D.Hrt and then put it in a bottle for you. Now head back to Scande
again. Now head back up the elevator, and the cloaked man will be gone
now. Walk through the palace, picking up the treasure boxes you'll
find along the way. The maze can be confusing at times, but you'll
know when you're almost done, when you find a healing spring. Continue
from the spring, and you'll soon run into Zog.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Zog

Zog for being a big character in the game isn't the final boss believe
it or not. As not to blow it, I'll just get down on how to kill him.
The easiest but not the fasted way is to have the Hero use Agni. This
will do 999 damage each round, but it fuses the whole party into one
dragon, allowing for just the one hit a round. If you want to do more
damage to him, have the Hero use Rudra, Karn should be morphed as
Puka, Nina should be there for healing support, and Bleu should use
BoltX. If you don't use Puka, Karn, Ox, and Gobi should all attack,
and Bo should attack or use Fry. Nina should use FortX, and Shield or
Dispel and ATK-Up on the whole party if you decide to fight Zog
without Agni. Don't use your D.Hrt here, there's a much better and
dirtier place to use it. Zog may take a long time to defeat, but just
keep at him, and after about 16 or 17 rounds of Agni (about 16-17k hp)
he'll be defeated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Zog, the floor will fall away and you'll be in a large
room. Inside the room with you will be Sara. She thanks everyone for
helping the Hero, and then she says that you'll have to destroy the
Goddess Keys. She tells the Hero to hand his keys over, and then the
cloaked man comes in and reveals himself as Jade. He thanks you for
riding him of Zog and handing over the keys, and mentions that Sara is
under his spell, and he has total control over her. They'll leave and
now try to leave the room, and then the mole people will dig through
the floor. Head down the hole, and then talk to the mole who's the
highest in the room. He'll then dig out of that room, now jump down
that hole. You'll be at the beginning of Scande again. Head out and
then head back to Agua. If you need to, you'll have to get the Tablet
from the bank again. Now head to Agua and head all the way up.

54. Top Floors of Agua

Items: FlameSH, IcyDR, LifeAR if you didn't get them earlier.

To head to where Jade and Sara went, you'll just need to walk up Agua
and then have Karn pick the locked doors. Near the top, where the Wisp
was, pick that door and then head up further into Agua. At the shrine
looking room, search the statues one for the IcyDR, the other for the
LifeAR. At the Top you'll run into Jade and Sara again. Jade will then
say that Tyr has been released and steps into a teleport. Follow him
through the portal. You'll now be inside the large tower, where you
found the Tri-Rang. I think this place is called Pagoda. Work your way
through that tower now.

55. Pagoda

Items: PowerAR, Domino, TrapGrd, StoneHT, AgileAR, FlameDR

This place isn't very much fun trying to navigate through it to say the
least. All I can really say is just to keep heading up, higher into
the tower. There are some great items in here, so try to collect them
all if possible. You might want to keep your Water Jar full here, or
just cast Exit and return to Romero to heal and try again, because
with all the dead ends here, and constant attacks, it can make
climbing this tower hard. Farther up in the Tower, you'll run across
Sara again. She wants to help you, but then your party will walk into
a force field and will be left with 1 hp left on everyone. Sara then
tells you she can't let you interfere with Jade's work, and attacks
you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Sara

There are two different approaches in defeating Sara. The first and
easiest way is to use your D.Hrt on her if you still have it. Both she
and the Hero will be left with 1 HP, and the next hit will kill her.
If you used the D.Hrt on Zog, you'll have to fight it out with her.
From here there are two different approaches in attacking. First you
can have the Hero use Agni, and then just outlast her, or you can have
him use Rudra. If you choose to use Rudra, have Karn if morphed use
Mrbl1's if you have them, and have Bleu use BoltX, while Nina uses
FortX and Dispel or Wall on the party, while healing them as needed.
If Karn is unmorphed, have him, Bo, Ox, and Gobi just straight attack
because that's all they be able to do. Mogu if used, can only attack
as well. Just keep repeating this process, and you should win.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Sara, she isn't really down on being defeated, but at
least now she can't be used by Jade to act evil when she really isn't.
Now head down the stairs that Sara was guarding and continue. You'll
come across a health spring, and if you follow the path, you'll come
to a room with those annoying blue and red switches again. On the
first floor, avoid the red switch and just follow the path south. Keep
following this path, and you should soon come to a floating platform
that leads to the left. Step on that one, then continue following the
path south again. You should come to the stairs leading up if you
follow the path, and you shouldn't come across one blue switch. On the
second floor, you should come across Jade, and then he'll blow up the
tower. The Hero will be knocked unconscious, and he'll wake up back
in Drogen. Its said that Jade has resurrected the Obelisk, and he's
there now. You are very near the end of the game now, you just need to
make one last trip around the world, and then head to Obelisk.

56. Extra Things to do Part V

This is the final extra things that you will need to do, but these
aren't extra, I figured I'd even this section out at five things to
do. First head to the house that's north of Auria, with a beach but is
blocked off by mountains. Talk to the old woman there, and she'll tell
you that she likes to collect weapons herself, and asks if you know
anyone else who does. Now head back to the weapons collector near
Gant. He then asks you to bring a List to her, and then moves out of
the way so you can enter his tent. Enter it, and grab the List plus
the 2 herbs, and now head back to the old woman again. She takes the
List, and wonders if the old man will recognize her weapon. Enter her
place, and take it from the treasure box, and then go back to Gant
again. The old man takes the weapon, but doesn't think its a weapon,
and wants more time to study it, but gives you a note to bring back.
Head back to see the old woman again, and get her note and bring it
back again. The letter says that the weapon is a tool called the
I.Claw for the mole people, and that your party can have it. After
getting the I.Claw, Warp or fly back to Gramor. Once there, head to
the upper right room, and then have Mogu in the lead and talk to the
Great Digger. He'll show Mogu how to use the I.Claw and then you can
enter Obelisk by digging through the solid rock floor. Next proceed
through the Obelisk.

57. Obelisk

Items: FlameHR, StarHR, EmporSD

Upon entering Obelisk near Scande, it might be a good idea to check up
on your inventory, and see if you have plenty of Mrbl1s and Mrbl3s
along with Cures and Life potions. These will be very useful in here,
and it pays to have a lot of these, after all you don't need money
anymore now do you? It should be spent on these items. Once inside,
head to the north, and then have Mogu dig through the ground, and
you'll be down inside the Obelisk. Again this isn't one of my
favorite places, but unfortunately it has to be done. Your first step
down here, is to follow the path to the south, and then take the right
floating platform and then follow the path there, and then take the
next platform that is up there. On the next floor (going down of
course), take the platform heading up. On the path above, there are two
more floating platforms. The top one will lead you into a loop, but
you will get the FlameHR out of it. The lower one will take you to
where you need to go, but I would recommend getting the FlameHR and
looping around, then continuing. You'll then run into Goda, and after
his little trash talking, follow him in the direction that he left,
and then go downstairs. Now take the floating platform up, and you'll
have to fight Goda.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Goda

Goda isn't too hard to beat, but he does have a lot of HP so it may
take a little while. The easiest way to beat him is to have the Hero
use Agni, and then just use Auto Battle, and cancel it when you need
to heal, and he'll be gone in a few rounds. Another way, while not as
easy is to have the Hero use Rudra, have Karn attack, Bleu should use
BoltX, and Nina should use FortX and CuraX if you have it otherwise
use Cura4 to heal. If Karn is unmorphed, have him, Bo, Gobi, Ox, and
Mogu all attack, and use the Mrbl1's if you have them. Goda usually
hits last, but even after FortX on the party is cast, he can still hit
fairly hard. Just keep after him, and heal when needed, and Goda
should be defeated in about 10-15 rounds (this various on what team
you use, and if you used the Mrbl1's for every attack or not.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Goda, head north into the hole he left in the wall, and
then proceed down the stairs. In the next room, you'll find yourself
on a small platform, with four floating platforms around you, one
heading in each direction. No matter which direction you choose, they
all lead to the same area. In the next room, just walk through the
room, using the ladders and the floating platforms as needed, to work
your way to the stairs going down. Once you go down the stairs, you'll
encounter Jade again, and this time you get to fight him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Jade

Jade is one of the tougher bosses to defeat in the game, but then again
he's the second to last boss of the game. You can use Agni to kill
him, just using Auto Battle until you need to heal then just cancel it
and then use a Cure, and repeat. Or you can have the Hero use Rudra,
Karn should be morphed as Puka and have him attack in that form or any
of his other forms, or if he's not morphed, attack anyway. If you are
using Bo, Ox, Gobi, or Mogu, just have them attack with Mrbl1's if you
have them. Karn if morphed, should use Mrbl1's too as should anyone
else who does the attacking. Nina should use FortX and Wall/Dispel if
you have it, and then have Bleu use BoltX. Jade will take a very long
time to defeat, but if you just use this process, he should be taken
care of soon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Jade, he claims that it was his destiny to loose, after
releasing the Goddess, Tyr. Personally, I think he just didn't want to
admit that he was such a looser to begin with. Anyway, search to the
left of his throne where he was to receive the EmporSD, the Hero's
best weapon. Search the back of the right pillar to receive the
StarHR. If you are ready, take the lift down, and confront Tyr. After
heading up to see Tyr, it seems that she is nothing but a young girl
who doesn't pose a threat to anyone. She asks you if you want a wish
granted. Saying 'Yes' will result in Tyr healing you, which isn't half
bad after that fight with Jade. If you are ready now, talk to her
again, and tell her you won't want to have a wish granted. You'll then
end fighting her. The first time, she won't fight back and you'll be
kicked out of the battle in a few rounds. She'll ask you why you're
attacking her, and that she hasn't done anything. Sara now a spirit,
will appear, and tell the Hero to use Agni and then she'll reveal her
true self. You'll then be engaged in battle once again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Boss: Goddess

Now depending upon how you defeat the Goddess will determine on which
ending you will receive. I know there are two endings to Breath of
Fire, but its been a long time since I last played, so I'll leave that
to you to discover on your own. Its really easy if you use an
emulator, just save state before this fight, and then defeat her one
way, then go back and do it the other way. To receive the bad ending,
on the second fight don't use Agni. Have the Hero use Rudra, and Karn
should be morphed and have him use Mrlb1's or just fight, and if he's
unmorphed, have him, Bo, Ox, Gobi, or Mogu if you have any of them,
use the StarHR for a comet affect inflicting 400 damage to her, while
Nina should use all the defensive spells she has, and Bleu should
attack with BoltX. If you run out of AP to attack and use spells with,
use your Water Jar if its full, or just hope for the best. The Goddess
has an even larger amount of HP than Jade, so she can take a long time
to beat. If you've taken the long way to killing her, I pity you
because you're going to see the bad ending. To receive the good
ending, have the Hero attack with Agni, and after the first use,
you're kicked out of the battle again. Tyr then throws some words at
you, and attacks again, this time in her real form. Now you can use
Agni, and heal when needed, or you can use your other methods, like
Karn attacking or using Mrbl1's Nina using her spells on the party,
and Bleu attacking with BoltX, while Karn unmorphed, Gobi, Bo, Ox, or
Mogu should be using the StarHR, or any other attacking items you may
have. Tyr takes a long time to defeat, but just keep after her, and
then she'll be wasted, and you can sit back and enjoy the good ending.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that Tyr is defeated, you can sit back and watch the ending to
Breath of Fire, but while the bad ending is rather dull, the good
ending isn't much better, but I have seen games with worse endings.
Now you can give yourself a pat on the back for going through a rather
interesting RPG to say the least.
=======================================================================

Section IV: Item List

I've tried to find every possible item in Breath of Fire, and I've
listed them all below on the ones that I have found. If there are any
more, I'm sure I can hack into it with my hex editor and Zsnes save
states just to make sure I've gotten all the items. Here goes the

Section V: Weapon List

Here is the complete weapon list for Breath of Fire. The chart will
have the in-game name for the weapon, and I'll try to give the full
name of it, it shouldn't be too hard to figure that out, and I'll also
include the attack power and the weight and who can use it. I know
some of the items have special effects in battle, but I'll worry about
those in a future revision of the walkthrough. The format will look
something like this:

Section VI: Armor List

This is a hopefully complete list of all the armors in Breath of Fire.
I had a little card that came with my original SNES game, but I
couldn't find some of the armors and decided to hack a BOF save state
and give myself all the armors in the game, and hopefully I didn't
miss anything. There is too many armors to list in one group so I'll
list it off according to their type whether it be an armor or shield
etc. On the subject of hacking my save state, it will appear that
there are numerous Dummy items in BOF in which case there is
something there but it is blank. It kind of upsets me because there
are some killer armors of all kinds for weaker characters like Karn
and Nina, I think I saw a shield for Karn and it had a defense of 120
or maybe it was 140. Needless to say, I think Square left out those
better items to balance out all the characters. Again like the weapon
chart I have redone this section and armors are much harder to tell if
they have any special affects or not but I will try to list any that I
can find, or if anyone knows of any armor and what it does feel free to
shoot me an email at Cal_96@hotmail.com. Anyhow the format for the new
armor chart will look like this:

=======================================================================

Section VIII: Magic List

In Breath of Fire, each spell has its own unique effect, while the Cura
spells and all the attack spells each heal or cause a certain amount
of damage. On the offense, attack spells will cause 50% more damage on
a creature weak to that spell. Nina, Gobi and Bleu are the only ones
who actually learn their spells through levels, but others like the
Hero and Karn require training to learn their spells, and Bo, Ox and
Mogu already start out with all their spells. Before I go any farther,
I'll list off the levels in which Nina, Gobi, and Bleu will learn all
their spells, then I'll list off the AP and affect of each spell and
where needed, I'll list the damage done to an enemy.

Now with this part I will break the spells down into charts just as I
did with the items and weapons and the rest, and with any luck make it
easier to find everything. The format for the magic spells will look
like this:

=======================================================================
Spell: The name of the spell.
AP: The minimum amount of AP needed to cast the spell.
Affect: A brief explanation of the spell.
Target: The number of targets which the spell will affect.
Damage: The amount of damage the spell will cause, or the amount of HP
it will heal. If it is listed as +50, this means it will heal 50 HP.
Weakness: The amount of damage caused if target is weak to element.

=======================================================================

*I don't know if these spells have an elemental attribute to them, but
I added the +50% damage factor into them just incase they are an
elemental attack.

**I believe that the HP/AP taken from these two spells is based upon
the Max HP or Max AP that these creatures have, and might be about
1/15 of that total. A flea has 15 HP and I was using Sap on him, and
was only stealing 1 HP from him.

Dragon Spells*
*There is a small change done to the dragon spells. They are almost
considered physical damage since you can get critical hits on them so,
I have added the Damage2 field after weakness. The first number is the
damage caused by the slam, while the second number will be if the
monster is weak and slammed, so 100/200 will indicate that 100 damage
is caused by a slam, while the 200 will show that the monster was
slammed and weak to the attack.

AP: 60
Affect: Powerful magic attack against all targets
Target: All enemies
Damage: 999
Weakness: 999
Damage2: 999/999
=======================================================================
*Rudra is a lightning based element I believe. I forgot to grab Agni
before fighting Zog, and BoltX obviously lightning was doing 600
damage to him, and Rudra was doing 960 on a slam, so that leads me to
believe it is lightning attack, but may have one or more others mixed
in with it.

**Agni is much like a fusion spell which Karn uses. In order to use
Agni, you need to have all 4 members of your current party alive. If
you are using Karn, he must be in his normal state, and cannot be
fused with anyone else, or you will not be able to use Agni until you
unmorph him and/or revive everyone else.

Fusion Spells

I have altered the magic charts again a slight bit as Karn's spells are
much different than the others, but are still spells. The format of his
chart looks like this:

=======================================================================
Spell: The name of the spell.
AP: The minimum amount of AP to cast the spell.
Joins with: Who Karn must join with to enable the fusion.
Description: What this fusion is able to do.
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Spell: Shin
AP: 10
Joins with: Bo, Gobi
Description: Shin can walk through woods and hunt like Bo, only better.
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Spell: Debo
AP: 15
Joins with: Gobi, Ox
Description: Debo is a strong fighter underwater, but not of much use.
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Spell: Doof
AP: 25
Joins with: Bo, Ox
Description: Doof is the strongest character, used to move heavy
things.
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Spell: Puka
AP: 40
Joins with: Bo, Gobi, Ox
Description: Puka is the best fusion spell, and second only to Agni.
=======================================================================

Mogu's spell

And finally we come to the lone spell that Mogu has, and I'll make it
just like the curative magic listed above and without any further delay
here it is.

=======================================================================
Spell: Dig
AP: 5
Affect: Flees the battle by digging out of it with 100% success. Cannot
        be used indoors or against bosses.
Target: All
Damage: N/A
Weakness: N/A
=======================================================================

Section IX: Monster List

This is a hopefully complete list of the monsters to be found and
fought with in Breath of Fire. I have only included their name and HP
because I just used Rub on them and it takes away all their HP so that
made it easy to figure out. I think the longer it takes you to kill
them, say defeat one group in one round and fight them again and defeat
them in two rounds, the gold and exp will be different. I've tried to
get this list in alphabetical order, but if not don't worry about it
too much. I didn't include the bosses, since they can't be Rubed and it
would only be a guess as to how much HP they have. I've tried to
include a location on where to find these and I've also found stats
such as gold, and exp that I had written down from somewhere, can't
recall if it was from the official Prima strategy guide or from the
map or other that came with the game, but with any luck it will give
you an idea on what to kill and what to avoid wasting your time with.
The format for the bestiary will look like this:

=======================================================================
Name: The name of the monster.
HP: How much damage the monster can take before being defeated.
ATK: This is the attack power of the monster. Higher numbers mean more
damage.
EXP*: This is a rough estimate of how much exp the monster is worth.
GP*: This is how much gold the monster is worth when defeated.
Weak**: This is what element if any the monster is vulnerable to.
Found: This is a rough location as to where the monster can be found.
=======================================================================
*: As I have mentioned previously, the gold and exp earned by killing
monsters doesn't seem to be set. One time you can kill one group of
monsters, and then kill the same exact group again, and you'll get a
different amount of exp and gold from before. I'm not really sure why
its like that, so I can only hope that the numbers that I found
provided through the game charts or the Prima guide are pretty accurate
so you can use them.

**: This is pretty much a guess on my part from the beginning as I have
listed before, items such as the E.Key or B.Stone do not get the
weakness bonus that spells will. If it is listed as Unknown on the
weakness, that is because there is no party member capable of casting
any spells to see if the monster is weak to. (This mostly applies to
bosses as you can only fight them once). Also if I have it listed as
None, it doesn't take into account spells such as 3.5 or Nova and
again this mostly takes to bosses as you don't get those spells till
late in the game as well.

Section X: Quick Exp Locations

This is something that I have imported into this walkthrough from my
Final Fantasy II walkthrough, and I think it works pretty good. Listed
below are places that I have noticed where levels are increased, and
aren't too hard to win battles at. As I said in the FF2 walkthrough,
any place can be a good place to level, it just depends on your
current level, and how much time and effort you're willing to put into
it.

1. Camlon: In Camlon the first time, the Hero is fighting alone, and
there are two healing springs there, so take your time to reach at
least level 5 and if you want to get some good gold take about an
extra 15 minutes or so and shoot for level 6.

2. Karma Tower: In the tower, your exp will be divided by 3 I think,
I haven't paid that much attention. Even so, just have Nina use the
E.Key and have the soldiers with her attack, and you should be able to
blow all the enemies away in one round. Keep this up for a while and
with the healing spring nearby, and you should earn at least to level
10 in no time at all.

3. Tantar and Tuntar: Here you'll come across some easy enemies that
you should attack with both the Rang and E.Key. Most of the enemies
should die in the first round, and since its only the Hero and Nina to
begin with the exp shouldn't be too bad. If you can fight the WarHogs
you'll get about 240 exp each or so from them, making them the enemies
of choice around here.

4. Bleak: After a long time without any really good exp/kill along
comes the G.Slimes of Bleak. These can amount to over 1000 exp/kill
and you should really spend a lot of time with these. The Hero, Bo,
and Nina should level quickly, and after you pick up Karn, you should
return here to help him gain some levels too. You can also run into
them in the Krypt, but its safer to fight them near Bleak.

5. Prima: This is one of the better places to get exp at first, but
rather dangerous. You'll first be alone with Gobi, but you can use
this to level him rapidly, but he can easily be mauled by the monsters
down there, because his HP isn't the best, and he is beyond slow. Just
use his spells on the monsters down there, and upgrade his equipment,
and leveling here shouldn't be too hard. Its also a good place to
spend a little time after the rest of the party gets down there.

6. Fortress: The game now becomes a little better paced and you'll now
have more characters but leveling shouldn't be hard yet. Inside the
fortress just keep going for the soldiers in there, and if you get
hurt, just walk out and then warp back to Gant, heal up, and go for it
again. They also give good gold, so you may want to upgrade your
equipment as well.

7. Ocean Volcano: There are a few good monsters to defeat down in the
volcano, and most give some decent gold. Just fight down here until
you can win easily, then head on with the game. The next few areas
shouldn't be too hard if you earned enough levels down here.

8. Gust: Outside of Gust there are some good monsters to kill for exp.
They do have spells that can hurt the whole party, but just keep
healed up, and when your AP or heal items start to run low, head back
into Gust and heal.

9. Both Dream Worlds: These are very good places to earn exp,
especially on the outside. Kill the WarHogXs and the Zooms and you'll
gain a load of exp. The other monsters are also good, and just stay
near the towns and heal when needed.

10. Pagoda: I think that's the name of it. There is a massive golden
slime here called the M.Slime and killing this will net 9999 exp and
9999 gold. Its a rare one to find, so spending time here might not be
so great. If you want some other exp, head back to Scande and hunt
around there for a while.

Section XI: Gobi's Shop List

This here is a list of the things that you can buy when using Gobi's
shop ability in either Prima or Tunlan. The format on for the list will
look something like this:

Timeframe:
=======================================================================
Item:                Starting Cost:    Second Offer:    Final Offer:
=======================================================================

Now just a small explanation about this. Timeframe is when I went in
with Gobi. So since I first get him the timeframe might be before
getting the Gills, or after getting Ox, etc. Item is pretty obvious, it
is what they are selling. The starting cost is what they ask for it at
first. Second offer is when you tell them no, and final if you can get
that far is what they'll ask for it before leaving. The second and
final offers will most likely vary quite a bit so I'll just list it as
it comes to me. Not everyone will go for second and final offers, so
if you come across an item I have marked as a must by with a *, I
wouldn't suggest you trying to haggle with them since they can take
quite a long time to show back up again.

Timeframe: First visit to Prima after defeating Octo. This also includes
defeating the SlimeX and getting the Statue to get into Wisdon. This is
before you go to Tunlan after defeating Pincher.

Section XII: Credits

There aren't too many credits to list here, except to myself for taking
the time to make this walkthrough, and to Capcom for originally doing
the game, and to Square for doing a good translation on BOF. I'll be
back again in the walkthrough business again, after I find a new game
to go through, and till then I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough, as
well as my Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 walkthroughs.

I'd also like to thank CJayC for allowing me to post this walkthrough
as well as my Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 walkthroughs at
GameFaqs.com for the past couple of years.
