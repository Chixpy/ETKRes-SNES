                                 INTRODUCTION
###############################################################################

This document features a comprehensive list of all the spells found in Breath
of Fire, which includes a plurality of dummy spells. Because documentation on
status ailments is relatively scarce, and these are primarily inflicted through
attacks covered in this document, I have sought to integrate that in my study.

Before proceeding further, there are several points that we have to clarify.
Firstly, all spells can only be used in battle unless otherwise specified. In
addition, all spells have information listed under "Element," "Learn at level,"
and "Incantation," but not all of them will make use of such data. For example,
only spells that inflict damage are affected by elemental modifiers; certain
spells are innate to Bo or Ox, or cannot be learned by any means; spells issued
from Ryu's Fight command or Gobi's Magic command never display an incantation
message.

As with my Monster Statistics Guide, the names assigned to the elements are
arbitrary, which is obviously due to the fact that the real names are unknown.
It should come as no surprise that the same applies to a handful of the status
ailments, such as "Shield," "Stop," and "Wall."

Spells whose hit rate depends on Wisdom operate as follows:
A) If target's Wisdom is greater than or equal to caster's, the hit rate is 25%
B) If target's Wisdom is less than caster's, then the hit rate is 37.5%

Finally, note that spells with a "Power" entry will systematically deal damage
in battle, as the value represents the potential damage that the target might
suffer.

                                STATUS AILMENTS
###############################################################################

The list below details information about the status ailments in this game.

Curs:
Changes the FATE rating of the afflicted to 1.

Dispel:
Renders the next spell cast upon the afflicted ineffectual. This excludes
spells issued from the Item command, Gobi's Magic command, or Ryu's Fight
command.

Pois:
Outside of battles, the afflicted will lose one HP with every step in hostile
territory. In battles, such a character will incur damage equal to 10.15625% of
its HP, with a minimum damage of one, every time its "Pois" counter falls to
zero, after which the counter is set to four. When a battle starts, the "Pois"
counter is automatically set to four.

Shield:
Causes magical attacks made on the afflicted to deal 60.15625% normal damage.
The status expires once the "Shield" counter reaches zero.

Mute:
Prevents characters from issuing spells from their Magic command, and disables
monster special attacks, whether they be magical or physical. This status does
not forestall counterattacks.

Doze:
Prevents the afflicted from taking action. The status expires once the "Doze"
counter reaches zero.

Stop:
Prevents the afflicted from taking action. The status expires once the "Stop"
counter reaches zero.

Stun:
Prevents the afflicted from taking action and, in most cases, being targeted.
Strangely, such a restraining effect does not exist outside of battle, as
characters afflicted with this status will still be able to use a magic spell.

Wall:
Renders the next spell cast upon the afflicted ineffectual. The spell is
returned to the caster at half the default "Power" rate (if the afflicted is
wearing an EchoHT, the rate might be one-eighth instead) except for monsters,
as well as characters under the effect of "Dispel." This has no effect against
spells targeted at the caster's party by default, and spells issued from the
Item command, Gobi's Magic command, or Ryu's Fight command.

Zom:
The effect of this status depends upon the time of day. During nighttime, the
ATK rating of the afflicted is doubled, whereas its DEF is set to 5. The rest
of the time, the ATK and DEF ratings are set to and 5 and 1, respectively.

The rest of the statuses serve no purpose other than to render certain spells
or items ineffectual. All counters are decremented at the end of every round.
Except for the "Pois" counter, this applies also to fallen combatants. Note
that "Curs," "Pois," "Stun," and "Zom" are the only statuses that persist
outside of battle.

Apparently because of sloppy coding practices, removing a status from a battler
will not necessarily reset the corresponding counter. As a result, when a
status is reapplied, it is possible that the counter will be greater than it
has been determined, depending on the bit pattern. This is due to the fact that
the algorithm accomplishes this task through the bitwise inclusive OR operator.

Each time a character's HP reaches zero, the game performs the following
sequence of events:
1. Lift all statuses
2. Set "Stun" status
3. Reset "Pois" counter
4. Restore ATK and DEF
5. Set FATE to equal Luck (negates the effect of equipment)

As you may have surmised, the character's ACT remains unchanged despite the
fact that the "ACT Up" and "ACT Down" statuses are removed. This behavior is
arguably a bug.
