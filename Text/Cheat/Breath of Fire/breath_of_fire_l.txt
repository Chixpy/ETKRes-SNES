    PREFACE
-----------

    You take the role of a young man [Ryu or Zack depending on whether you
    are playing on SNES or GBA] who comes from the Light Dragon clan. The
    Dragon clans of Light and Dark have been fighting for many years and
    while the Dark Dragons reign supreme the Dragons of Light are forced to
    lie low. Ryu's only hope of finding his abducted sister is to find all
    the Goddess Keys for which the Dragons' power comes from...

    Breath of Fire was originally published in Japan by Capcom in 1993 as
    Buresu obu Faia: Ryuu no Shenshi [Dragon Warrior]. Squaresoft licensed
    the game and released it in the US. In 2001 Capcom released it for Game
    Boy Advance, making it the company's first RPG.

    For those of you who've played the other BoF games, the first game can
    be a little disappointing. In ways it's better than BoF2, but some of
    the things are less developed, like Ryu's fishing game. But it helps
    you to understand the story of the rest of the series.
      BoF is nowhere near as good as any of the Final Fantasies, though I
    must admit the simplicity of the game is a nice change to all that
    character development stress-material you tend to find in the FF games.
    I like to think of it as a simpler yet more developed FF1, though there
    is little replay value.

    The story is pretty simple, in fact I would go so far as to say it's
    like a cheap imitation of the Dragon Quest/Warrior series that had been
    released in Japan and America at that point. Though for Square (which
    hadn't merged with Enix at that time) I guess it was better than no
    dragon games at all.

    The characters, monsters and story are all childlike and the translat-
    ion isn't that great (as was the rule with those early Japanese RPGs,
    on top of being toned down for the American Audience). In Japan the
    childlike element is expounded upon, in America it is seen as immature
    and not worthy of much thought.

    I don't know how basic a game can get in terms of sheer ease of play;
    pretty much the hardest things are knowing where to go next and fight-
    ing battles at a low level. I have tailored my walk-through to that.

    The abilities and characters that you get throughout the game are cool
    but since I hate really long dungeons I used a couple of cheats to
    speed things up a bit.
      It's nice having so many characters, not so good that so many of them
    are so unlikeable. Gobi and Mogu are wierd, Bo isn't much better. Cap-
    com experimented in too many things with this game and characterisation
    was one of them.

    My preferred version of Breath of Fire is the GBA one terms of a better
    general layout and the fact that you can pretty well play it anywhere
    you want to [with a DS you don't even need to worry about AA batteries
    anymore]. And really this is the ideal kind of game to play when you've
    got a spare moment with nothing else to do.

    Lastly, there are two completely horrible things in this game; the
    music and the ending. The combination of those two along with me play-
    ing the game all day and feeling a bit sick made me have horrible night
    mares half the night, going on some wierd quest with Bleu through a
    maze of hex code in search for some special number with that dungeon
    music in the background. DO NOT make the same mistake!
      Yet I continue to play the game. Why? It has something. This game has
    something.

    - The differences between the GBA and SNES versions are rather sparse
      [in comparison to other remakes] but I will mention them when they
      come up.

    1:02  SCREEN MAPS
---------------------

           1:02A  Field & Over-world
           -------------------------

            - You can talk to people, open chests and enter buildings in
              field and world map modes.
            - In most cases the two modes are exactly the same except that
              time doesn't pass in field mode.

           1:02B  Menu
           -----------

            - The first option is the item menu. You may store and use up
              to 48 types of items and 99-100 of each. That's a total of
              4800 items! You can discard some items if you have too many,
              though. In the SNES version you can sort the items manually,
              whereas the GBA version has an automatic system and a
              special compartment for "vital" items that are crucial to
              the story. The SNES version has a special option that gives
              you information about each item when you choose it, but the
              GBA only gives limited information when you choose it the
              normal way.
            - In the GBA version, the magic menu is next (whereas it's the
              armour menu in SNES BoF). You may use any outside-of-battle-
              spells that a character knows in the magic menu and assign
              fighting equipment in the categories of weapon [WPN], armour
              [ARM], shield [SHD] and helmet [HLM]. [ETC] is for accessor-
              ies. The different types of equipment will effect certain
              stats as ATCK (damage potency using a physical weapon), DEF
              (how much damage will be inflicted by enemies' attacks),
              ACT (how many turns the party member will get in battle),
              INT (how proficient the character is using magic), FATE (how
              lucky the character is) and MAG DEF (how well the character
              can defend against sorcery and magical attacks.
            - The status menu elaborates on stats even further. See the
              glossary for more information on game terms.
            - You will have to press the L and R shoulder buttons to move
              your players back/forward a row and go into defensive mode
              respectively.

           1:02C  Battle
           -------------

           The top of the screen shows the participants in the battle. The
           enemies are on the left side while your allies are on the right.
           Battle in Breath of Fire is similar to Dragon Quest because you
           must choose actions for all of your party members before they'll
           carry them out.
             On the bottom of the screen is a status window and actions
           menu. First, there is an starting battle menu...

            - The picture of a sword allows you to individually choose each
              party member's actions.
            - AB stands for Automatic Battle. Your characters will attack
              the enemy until someone wins.
            - RUN allows your party to escape the battle (if possible).
            - ST will allow you to check your party members' status, just
              like the status screen in the main menu. Because there is a
              blank space where your hero's name should be, his status
              screen is somewhat hidden, but selectable none-the-less.
            - The vertically running arrows will move your leading party
              member forward or back into the front or back row. In the
              front row melee attacks will be more powerful, but projectile
              type weapons and any magical spells are not effected when in
              the back row, so it is advisable to keep there if your party
              member is not the close-combat type.
            - The horizontally running arrows allow you to change your
              party leader (if it is possible).

              Now I will list the secondary, individual action that can
            be made in battle...

            - The unsheathing sword: attack using equipped weapon.
            - Shield: guard against attacks (they will cause less damage
              and there is a greater chance of evasion).
            - Magic Staff: use any magic the character knows (if they have
              enough MP).
            - Bag: use an item you have in your inventory that can be
              brought into battle.

               up to 6 turns for up to 20% more as well.

             Level: For characters and enemies alike, battle competency is
                largely based on their level. While enemies have fixed lvs
                and will become really easy for a while, you can level each
                of your characters up to 99; not only will the become
                stronger in their individual ways they will learn new
                abilities on the way. To find out how much EXP is needed
                for each level up see the characters' respective stat
                screens in the menu.

             1:03B  Status
             -------------

             I have separated the stats in RPGs into two distinct categ-
             ories. Natural stats are gained by levelling up and taking
             items while equipment values are merely the stats of the
             equipment brought out to their full potential only by having
             good natural stats.

             Equipment Values: ATTACK   ATK    Attack          999
                               DEFENSE  DEF    Defence         999

                               Wt.      WGHT   Weight          16

             Strength: The higher this stat is the less the weight of a
               weapon will be and the higher its potential for causing
               damage.

             Attack: These values control how strong the person will be
                when they attack using their weapon.

             Vigor & Defence*: These stats are what effect the damage done
                by physical attacks from enemies. Armour that gives Defence
                and takes away from other stats is most common, but you'll
                need to walk a fine line between choosing these and drawing
                the full potential of your characters [rather than making
                them all tanks].

             Agility: The higher a characters' agility is the more they'll
               be able to evade attacks from enemies.

             Active*: In each battle line up there is an order of turns
               depending on who has the highest Active value.

             Wisdom & Intelligence*: These values determine how well a
               character can cast magic. For characters like Mogu who are
               not magic users it doesn't matter so much. I don't know if
               these values effect special abilities like Mogu's Dig.

             Luck & Fate*: As there are few items that give Fate when
               equipped these values often stay the same

             Magic Defence: Determine how much damage a character recieves
               from special enemy abilities and spells.


             1:03C  Status Ailments
             ----------------------

             Sometimes an enemy will afflict one of your characters with a
             "status ailment," all of which have telltales & must be cured.
             There are a wide range of status ailments in Breath of Fire.
             To explain what they are I will have to explain what each of
             them does, so here goes.

             Ailment   Symptom              Remedy
             -------   -------              ------
             Poison    Gradual loss of HP   Antdt,Antler,Mackrl,Trout,Tonic

    1:04  ADVICE
----------------

             1:04A  General
             --------------
              - Save and rest at inns often to keep healthy and happy.
              - Stock up on healing and support items as often as you can.
              - Put weak or dying characters in the back row.

             1:04B  Battles
             --------------
             A big part of your fight in any game is analysing it from all
             points of view before you begin. There are many factors you
             have to consider and plans of action you have to prioritise.
               Breath of Fire is one of the easiest RPGs in history. In
             fact all you really need is the patience to level up and exp-
             lore every little bit of the map.
               Later on you'll have the opportunity to choose various party
             members for your line-up. You'll need tank-types with heavy
             constitutions who can man the the front line so that the
             faster and weaker combatants can sneak over and dislodge some
             crack in the enemy's plan...or complete a battle objective.
             Medic types such as Nina and Bo will always be in high demand
             when the fighting starts but depending on the toughness of a
             battle you will need to take extra precautions to defend them.
             Well, Bo's not entirely weak but he's in the middle.


===========================================================================
                                 CHAPTER 2
===========================================================================

When the Dragon Family was a the peak of its power, a goddess of desire,
Tyr, appeared who granted wishes. The Dragons fought for this power. Tyr
encouraged the fighting and watched the war of the Dragons escalate. When
the world was at the brink of destruction a warrior and his 7 companions
stepped forth and locked the goddess up after defeating her in battle. The
"Goddess Keys" were hidden throughout the world. The Dragons of Light bal-
anced the power of the family and peace reigned again.

    2:00  WALK-THROUGH
----------------------

          The boss battles are easy enough and don't require much strategy.
          As long as you level up plenty the game should be a breeze in
          terms of battles. In fact, I don't see the point in levelling up
          anyway, so I use cheat codes in that area. There seems to be a
          taboo against cheating, but the cheats I use are only to save
          time that would otherwise be spent in mindless levelling up.

          Notes: - # indicates it's to do with the GBA version.

             When you first start the game and are in your hot, smoking
             room, stop an' take the time to open your chest to take out
             Ryu's most valuable possession; a V.Ptn! You won't be able to
             go back to that room so that's why I'm telling you about the
             item.
               When you enter the floor below, talk to the girl on the left
             (there are only three girls there), then the one next to her
             to continue the game.

               There are a couple of shops in Drogen but there isn't a lot
             to choose from. The equipment sucks, but the prices on normal
             items are very cheap for a long while yet, so stock up! Espec-
             ially on Antdts, Herbs and Mrbl3. 18x Antdts, 'cos poison is a
             very common and annoying ailment.
               You might want to stick around for a while, levelling up,
             saving at the shrine and talking to one of the NPCs in Ryu's
             burned house to heal. You're on a quest to destroy the evil
             empire of Zog and rescue your sister, so you'll need to be
             strong!
               Though it's probably better to avoid fighting altogether un-
             til you reach the dungeon in Nanai, as there are many healing
             springs in it. The monsters on the world map are tough and
             offer lousy EP.

               It may help to note that those trees with apples on them,
             roaming animals and fish in the sea aren't just ornaments!
             They are to do with abilities later on in the game.

             To prevent premature game over I advise you stay close to the
             healing springs at first.
               P.Bugs are the safest enemies to start off with, being the
             weakest enemies so far with the best EP and GP on offer. The
             only danger you face from P.Bugs is being poisoned, so you
             heal ASAP (I'm assuming you brought plenty of Antdts).
               Creeps yield good EP, but not a lot better as they're consid
             erably tougher. Beaks are half-way there. But if you find your
             self in front of a monster who's as tough or tougher than you
             are, all you can do is defeat the thing (or escape if you're
             *really* lucky). Glooms offer lousy EP / great GP and are easy
             unless you find yourself on the recieving end of their power-
             ful spells.

               Don't be dismayed if there are various parts of a floor you
             can't reach yet (unless you go to open a door and it does't
             work--highly unlikely). Many Breath of Fire Dungeons are des-
             igned in such a way that you'll return to a single level many
             times via stairways.
               Don't just equip all the new gear you pick up. For instance,
             the BronzSD is less better overall than your starting weapon
             even though its Attack is superior Ryu may not have enough
             Strength to carry such a heavy weapon and it ends up being
             less effective than your old one. To see more information see
             the weapons and equipment ratings list in the appendices.
               There are two chests near the end of the dungeon area; one
             that heals you and the other that damages AP (which doesn't
             matter because Ryu won't have any use for AP until much later
             anyway).

             2:00C  Boss: Frog
             -----------------
             After this battle you'll no longer be fighting battles in
             Camlon's castle any longer (you were there to get rid of them
             remember?), though P.Bugs and Beaks will become more common
             on the world map as you continue.

             (this is for an ability near the end of the game). Head strait
             south of the claw to find the town.
               As for monsters, nearly all of them are fair game except
             Slimes (a waste of time to begin with, save them for Dragon
             Quest!).
               Nanai is closely guarded by day...and not so closely once it
             hits nightfall. Provided you can sneak past the guards that
             *are* awake [which is no feat], at least you have a place to
             save.
               If you played Metal Gear Solid, ever, it should be dead
             easy to sneak past a couple of sleepy guards or be thrown out
             temporarily. Go too close to any guards and you'll be thrown
             out. it there's a guard right next to a door it'll be unsafe
             to go near that door. one on them is semi-hidden behind a
             house on the north-eastern corner of town, so watch out! There
             is a house you can enter above him that contains 2x Herb.
               The town has a few shops with a couple of items, but all
             overpriced and nothing worth it. If you want items go back to
             Drogan (you'll level up anyway, so much for new equipment).
             Get your items from the drawers and stuff found in houses.
               Gaia Temple is in the Centre of town.

             Make sure you bring plennty of Herbs for the dungeon, for the
             Glooms' thunder attacks more than anything.
               There's more treasure in this dungeon and the enemies are a
             little tougher. It doesn't start being a dungeon until you go
             into the central staircase; the rest is like a combination be-
             tween a normal house and castle.
               Here is a layout of the turns you should take in the maze-
             like area beneath the temple.

             2:00F  Boss: Knight
             -------------------                HP: 390 | EP: 700 | GP: 500
             Note that when you defeat the Knight you will never be able to
             visit Nanai again. At level 10 you'll probably have this
             battle underhand, Though I could manage it at 8. The lower the
             level is the more strategy you need.
               You should need about 9x Herb for this battle, because the
             boss will use T.Bolt to gradually decimate your HP (but only
             use a herb at half HP).
               When the boss gets its second wind you'll need to heal more
             often. The Knight's attacks will be weaker but he doesn't have
             a lot of HP left. In this period he'll also heal himself a lot
             -- but don't let this change your behaviour as it's a sign
             that you're nearly there!
               There is a 13.28% chance of the Knight dropping an F.Stn.

             2:00G  Travelling to Winlan
             ---------------------------
             To reach this city you will need to head far west, past the
             ruins of Nanai, then north. There is a cave nearby but you
             will have to speak with the royalty of Winlan to gain admiss-
             ion there.

             2:00H  Winlan Shops & Exploring
             -------------------------------
             For equipment the best is Bronze Sword and Chain Mail; at the
             item shop you should probably get your basic healing gear.
             Search the drawers in houses to get some items. And DON'T go
             in the river unless you want to swept outta the city pronto!

             2:00G  Winlan Castle
             --------------------
             Save before you do anything in here, for you won't be playing
             as Ryu for a while, but Princess Nina. Talk to the guards on
             either side of the woman to get some chests that are locked
             up; walk past them to leave the castle. You might want to
             purge the castle of chests before you leave as the dungeons
             ahead are pretty gruelling. You'll also want to buy some new
             equipment. PS: You'll be getting 2 new temporary party members
             who use the same equipment as Ryu in the next section.

             2:00H  Aura Cave
             ----------------
             I have a few tips about this dungeon; leave bridges and stairs
             for last and it'll take less long to realise that you need to
             go back for certain chests. Oh, and make sure you get an item
             called Iron Ore [or I.Ore for SNES version]; you'll need it
             later on.

             2:00I  Going through Romero
             ---------------------------
             For the jar puzzle in the hideout make sure you push the first
             jar to the right and the rest should be easy; the Map is in
             the barrel. You need to get on the other side of the town and
             to do that, take the westernmost exit; you'll on the world map 
             and be able to continue left.

             2:00J  The Ramui Woods Maze
             ---------------------------
             This er...dungeon can be the most befuddling in RPG history,
             but it's not even a maze! If you stick to the main path and go
             pretty much in a strait line through the forest you'll get
             through fine. Think of it as being divided into two distinct
             east and west sections; the east section contains a chest in
             its north; the west section has four sub-sections, three
             contain a chest and in one there is the exit...there's more to
             it than that... There quite a few chests to be found if you
             want to stick around and level up a bit.

             2:00K  Karma Tower Entrance
             ---------------------------
             It first it may seem confusing where you should go first;
             there are stairs going up and down as well as a boss blocking
             the passage; do the stairs first.

             2:00L  Boss: Morte
             ------------------                 HP: 120 | EP: 280 | GP: 200
             Give the boss a caution-attack combination (but not so much
             caution, as there's a healing spring nearby and you don't
             want to use too many items!) -- don't get the girl to attack
             as her weakling moves aren't worth the time wasted on them.

             2:00M  Climbing Karma Tower
             ---------------------------
             The maze has onion-like structure where you will be moving up
             and down stairs all the time; when you enter a floor all the
             leads on your side will lead nowhere; there are two floors
             that are like this. There are holes that fall through to the
             bottom of the tower but only one of them leads anywhere useful
             -- where there are four holes, enter the on the upper right.

             2:00N  Boss: Mortea
             -------------------                HP: 230 | EP: 280 | GP: 200
             Like last time Nina should be in supportive or defensive pos-
             ition. Be very wary of Mortea whittling down your HP and tak-
             ing advantage of an [even momentarily] weakened character.
             Don't think you've won when the boss's HP is nearly out -- at
             this point he'll get a second wind; he'll take quite long to
             flick off and also be twice as damaging to your characters.

             2:00O  Twin Tower
             -----------------
             At the top of the twin tower are a save statue and healing
             spring, so take advantage of those. You'll need to step on
             one of those buttons before you go down too.

             2:00P  Boss: Wizard
             -------------------
             You can't win this. This is a dead end in the game. No go.
             Thankfully, you can have one of your party members go for help
             if you choose the escape option...

             2:00Q  Humanity Saves the Day!
             ------------------------------
             As Ryu you'll be able to go back to the same place; note that
             if you go west of where you can see the boss there's a chest
             there that heals HP and MP and gives you a Rang; kind chest,
             isn't it.

             2:00R  Boss: Wizard
             -------------------
             HP: 180       Like the Knight before him, Wizard knows the All
             AP: Infinite  Powerful 10 HP expelling thunder bolt spell, but
             Atk: 40       don't let that perturb you, you're doin' great!
             Def: 24       He has more HP than the last boss, but Ryu is
             Act: 60       much stronger than the soldiers you used to
             Wis: 128      fight the morte brothers.
             EP: 1,000
             GP: 700

             2:00S  Back in Winlan......for the Last Time?
             ---------------------------------------------
             If you explored the castle you should know where the king is.
             Nina is beside his bed you you'll have to talk to her to cont-
             intue the story (not that there are any side-plots to be conc-
             erned with anyway, Breath of Fire being a simple RPG and all).
             Now you can take the eastern exit to the bridge. I don't
             think you can take those chests now.

             2:00T  Tantar the Remote
             ------------------------
             Go south along the road that you meet upon leaving the bridge.
             There is a forest along the way but you can't enter it yet.
             Tantar is the only place worth going at the moment. If you've
             go Iron Ore [which is found in Aura Cave if you haven't got it
             already] the smith in Tantar will trade it for a Saw.

             2:00U  Lament Woods
             -------------------
             Go to that forest you couldn't enter before... Now you have
             the saw, that stupid tree is no problem [no offence to trees].
             What you have here is a short maze with three chest areas, one
             to the south-east, one to the north-west and another to the
             west mid-range. To get to the end you'll have to take the path
             to the very north and follow it east; it's quite close to the
             chest in the north-west as well.

             2:00V  How to Survive Dark Dragon's Fort
             ----------------------------------------
             There are various traps throughout this dungeon which will
             take you to rooms with treasure chests in them [which may
             become annoying after you've opened all the chests]. Most of
             the time it happens when you walk under one of those bat
             things but it'll also happen without a bat if you take the
             lower routes in the entrance floor. Keep your HP up, as there
             are easy yet frequent semi-bosses in this fort, and there's
             even a chest that takes 50 HP from your whole party [I was
             killed by this once, no kidding].

             2:00W  Boss: Pog
             ----------------                 HP: 280 | EP: 1,400 | GP: 800
             The red head shoots balls of flame and the blue one is charged
             with electricity! Ryu's a fighter, Nina's a healer, so the
             assumption is logical.
               If you want you can skip the battle if you answer "no" to
             the imposter chief's question enough times, but the next boss
             battle will be harder.

             2:00X  Filler 1: Names, names, names
             ------------------------------------
             You'll notice that the names in Breath of Fire seem to have
             very obvious meanings. Winlan is simply a shortening of "wind
             land." Morte, Morteo and Mortea all come from the same French
             word "morte," meaning "death" [which doesn't seem that obvious
             but you would see if you looked in any decent dictionary].

             2:00Y  Boss: General
             --------------------             HP: 250 | EP: 1,120 | GP: 300
	         Not another battle! This time you get support, and he can use
             a spell that the enemy is weak to! Be careful to have Nina
             keep Bo's HP up though...

             2:00Z  Investigating Romero
             ---------------------------
             With Bo in the lead, you can *walk through* most forests. That
             means you can get to Romero without having to go through Win-
             lan and Aura Cave [for those who don't know where to go, it's
             the forest north of Winlan which you must enter from the east.
             The folks of Romero will tell you how to reach Agua [which is
             the floating tower west of Romero...] ...if you get rid of
             their zombie problem. There's a cave to the south west which
             is surrounded by forests and a moat where you can get the wat-
             er, but you need a jar first! That you can get from the old
             geezer standing around in Romero cemetery...but! [there's al-
             ways a trick] you must talk to him in day-time, *then* night-
             time.

             2:01A  The Ease Cave Water Spring
             ---------------------------------
             Directly south of Karma Tower [that place where you fought the
             wizard who used Zeon Gas] is your next dungeon [beware the
             Mages!]. Like other BoF mazes it seems the direct approach
             will get you through to the end the quickest way with all
             cardinal turn-offs leading to chests with dead ends except in
             the third floor where you must choose between two sets of
             stairs; the northern one leads to a chests and the south stair
             to the springs.

             2:01B  Going to Agua...or is it...Agua Tower!
             ---------------------------------------------
             Now you have the Tablet you can use it on that place west of
             Romero and east of Karma Tower where nothing happened before.
             Of course, nothing's as easy as it seems and you have a whole
             tower-maze before you. Though it's done in a fun way and the
             monsters aren't too tough. It's easy to predict where the mov-
             ing platforms go and so where to move.

             2:01C  Boss: Wisp
             -----------------                HP: 730 | EP: 1,200 | GP: 300
             Stronger and quicker than your last boss, the only difference
             is that you'll need to be well stocked with curing items and
             have full AP. Nina can use her supportive spells on Ryu and Bo
             while they attack and cast offensive spells. After this battle
             you will be able to operate the stone robot over east-way.

             2:01D  Enter the Giant
             ----------------------
             The giant is located about as far north above Tantar and Tunt-
             ar as you can go in this continent. This is no maze, and as
             such there is no need to give you a stratagem for it.

             2:01E  Boss: General & Lancer 2x
             --------------------------------
             Look who's at it again! And they're just as weak as they were
             last time you fought them. It's no reason to be too complacent
             though.

             2:01F  The Giant's Teleport Platforms
             -------------------------------------
             The first teleport other than the one right in front of the
             giant's heart leads you to a place with three teleport units.
             Every time you see three units it will be the same story; the
             first one takes you back to the beginning again, the second
             leads to a chest and the third to a new set of teleports.

             2:01G  The Lake Caves
             ---------------------
             You can't really enter the Lake Cave until you get the key for
             it; that you can get from the Elder of Tantar village. In
             these caves you'll have to go down a series of waterfalls to
             get the key.

             2:01H  The Wedding Crusher
             --------------------------
             Everyone's in Tantar, ready to celebrate Terry and Amelia's
             union as soon as you enter the mayor's house -- Tuntar is tot-
             ally empty! Well, enjoy...

             2:01I  Boss: Gremlin
             --------------------           HP: 1,200 | EP: 1,400 | GP: 800
             You will need to do the teleport maze again and confront the
             General [who it seems is your rival...but why?]. Gremlin is
             weak to Fire type attacks. Bo is usually weaker than the other
             two, so cast protective magicks on him. Gremlin is much str-
             onger in his limit break form, so be careful of that.

             2:01J  Boss: Talon <side-quest>
             ------------------                 HP: 700 | EP: 400 | GP: 190
             There's a Dragon Training Hall just south of the Volcano where
             Ryu can gain three shiny new spells! Even though it's a one-on
             -one battle you'll probably find that it's not hard. I won at
             level 17 and Ryu was twice as strong as his enemy.

             2:01K  Under Lock and Key in Auria
             ----------------------------------
             What a weird town. Every time a soldier sees you you get
             thrown in jail and have to talk to the sleeping guy to get out
             again [there's an item in the sink btw]. If you give the guy
             in the second floor of the item shop an vitamin he gives you
             loads of money [must've been a pretty *bad* illness *snicker*]
             You also get a lot of money from getting Nina to heal the man
             in the north-western house; you'll also have to get her to
             open the chest there or you'll be thrown in jail *again.* And
             you'll get ill if you eat those potatoes! In the house
             opposite there's an accessory in the closet which gives its
             wearer 10+ intelligence. Oh, and if you talk to the man who
             owns the mansion to the north after talking to the guy at the
             dock you'll see a scene [sorta].

             2:01L  The Fairies and the Cutting of their Trees <side-quest>
             -------------------------------------------------
             This will involve quite a lot of to-ing and fro-ing from Auria
             to the fairy woods near the dragon training centre. 1) Talk to
             the fairies in their wood [you'll need Bo to get there] and
             the pattern of flowers on the world map that looks like a
             square; 2) Talk to the woman in the mansion to the north-west
             in Auria; 3) Go back to the fairy woods and tell them you'll
             revert that bad boy's habits for good; 4) Go and talk to the
             boy; 5) Return to the mother; she'll give you 20,000 G.

             2:01M  Getting the Icicle in Bleak
             ----------------------------------
             To cross the next geological barrier in this game you need
             something cold to survive the heat of the dessert at the end
             of the cave south-west of Bleak. Quest mostly spent in Auria.
             There's this guy in the main building of Bleak who'll give you
             the Icicle if you give him a Gold Bar first. G.Bars can be
             bought in the shop in Auria, but at a premium. I'll give you
             an overview of good ways to earn money... 1) In Bleak, accept
             the offer from the man at the inn for a free night's lodging &
             he'll try to steal your Pouch [which you have to buy from
             Auria item shop] but end up giving compensation; 2) Give
             Vitamin to man on second floor of item shop in Auria; 3) Have
             Nina cure a man in one of the Auria mansions; 4) Sell the Gold
             Tiara you found in the rich man's house as it's useless any-
             how....

             2:0AA  See Chun-Li from Street Fighter <side-quest>
             --------------------------------------
             There's a guy in Bleak you offers to show you a magic trick
             for 100 G. Say YES to him the first 2 times and every other
             option say NO and you'll see Chun-li doing her "Lightening
             Kick."

             2:01N  Boss: Sand Worm
             ----------------------       HP: 1,600 | EP: 1,200 | GP: 1,200
             What you really want to do is enter the building just south of
             the dessert village but first you need the Fife, and the mayor
             of Arad is only willing to give it to you if you defeat a
             monster that has been plaguing the village at night [yes, I
             know they say the full moon but sound familiar don't it?]. So
             you have to mosey up to the conspicuous stone tablet at night
             and fight the damn thing.
             It's amazing how weak the Sand Worm is to magic, especially
             of the thunder variety. Ryu's dragon form really made this
             battle work for me.

             2:01O  Uncovering the Krypt
             ---------------------------
             This is a rather curious dungeon; in the first major floor you
             are likely to fall into an expansive room the size of the
             whole dungeon with nothing but a couple of staircases you can
             not go on. My tip is to hug the sides of the platforms and
             avoid going into open spaces. Every chest has a trap in it, so
             come prepared with heaps of curing items. The rest of the
             dungeon is made easier with a new party member in the lead. Or
             you could just investigate the locations of the chests later
             [with Karn in the lead you won't be falling into traps without
             meaning to]. In the final chamber there are many caskets that
             need to be tested for the scroll. The one you need is on the
             bottom left hand corner of the chamber.

             2:01P  Boss: Eye Spy
             --------------------         HP: 1,600 | EP: 2,800 | GP: 2,800
             Al-righty, start the routine; Ryu transforms into thunderdrake
             Nina casts support spells, Bo casts Fry, etc. When Bo has run
             out of AP just go into Automatic Battle and Ryu will kill the
             beast for you.

             2:01Q  New Doors to Open <side-quest>
             ------------------------
             - The locked chamber in Winlan castle just before the bridge.
             - On the top floor of Agua Tower there's a section you
               could not go to before. In the chamber with the statues of
               dragons you can examine them to get some really awesome
               equipment.
             - Various doors in the Bleak-Auria Passageway.

             2:01R  L. Keep [east of Bleak]
             --------------
             This tower has a lot of treasure but your main headache [other
             than monsters] will be knowing where to go. Clues can be taken
             from what kind of stair you see near a chest, whether it goes
             up or down. That helps a lot.

             2:01S  Boss: Cloud
             ------------------           HP: 1,400 | EP: 4,800 | GP: 1,200
             Name sound familiar? Hehe. Anyhow, your only chance against
             this enemy is turning Ryu into a Snow Dragon. After the battle
             you'll be able to get the Mirror item.

             2:01T  Boss: Knight & Archer
             ----------------------------
             With Karn on board you can finally get into that safe in the
             big mansion. You'll find the long awaited Lt.Key at the top of
             the tower. The battle takes place at the dock but is easy;
             Thunder Dragon and Fry should work fine.

             2:01U  The Rocks of North Peninsula Cave [north of Auria]
             ----------------------------------------
             If you give Gobi on the dock a gold bar, in return he'll give
             you an item that will allow you to blow up the rocks in the
             cave to the north. You should have found a gold bar in a chest
             up to this point.

Note: You might want to deposit all your money at this point, as not far in
  the distant future you will be in control of a single character who dies
  very easily and the easiest way of getting to the next town is dying [but
  you lose 25% of your money].

             2:01V  Battles in the Secret Base & Dark Dragon Ship
             ----------------------------------------------------
             To continue the story you'll have to fight ever boss here.
             Most are easy mini-bosses and there's a formal boss who is
             weak to thunder. Boss: Squid.
                   HP: 1,000 | EP: 6,000 | GP: 4,200.

             2:01W  Boss: Octo
             -----------------            HP: 1,000 | EP: 6,000 | GP: 1,500
             After taking the ship from the dock in Auria you have to fight
             a series of easy battles, then fight the boss. Keep your str-
             ength up and don't waste any MP! Like Squid [or any aquatic
             creature] the octopus is weak to thunder.

Note: Don't worry about the money Gobi charges, you'll get it later.

             2:01X  Hunting for Gills
             ------------------------
             With Gobi you can enter the ocean via beaches, and you can't
             go far. To the west is Prima and the north, a volcano dungeon
             that's not worth breaking your teeth on at the moment. Prima
             has many shops with some things at different prices [so it
             pays to shop around and be cautious with your gold].
               To get to the town of Gant go south of Prima and continue 
             south over land until you reach the town [if you go north at
             that juncture there's only a weapons collector who says he's
             never seen the B.Rang]. There's a man in Gant who'll ask you
             to deliver some Goods to Prima and when you do so, you are
             given the gills. Congratulations!
               When you get back you'll have to fight Mortea [an easy boss]
             then you'll get a new party member that can break down weak
             rock walls.

             2:01Y  Gobi's Shop <side-quest>
             ------------------
             Unless you already know, you can actually get Gobi to trade
             his wares at a shop in Prima! The following is a chart of all
             the things on offer and how many offers given (though the
             availability will change throughout the game):

                      Rarity  1st    2nd    3rd   Usual Price
             F.Stn    ?       12     11     10    ?
             LightRP  ?       48     36     28    ?
             Smoke    ?       60     45     35    ?
             Antdt x9 ?       80     60     45    ?
             ProtnB   ?       180    165    150   ?
             Rod2     ?       1,200  1,100  1,00  ?
             Cure2    ?       1,950  -      -     ?
             SteelBW  ?       2,400  2,200  -     ?
             HuntGL   ?       2,700  2,475  2,025 ?
             MetalAR  ?       5,400  4,050  3,150 ?
             ThundrRP ?       5,400  4,050  3,150 ?
             SilverDR ?       6,000  5,550  5,000 ?
             AngleRP  ?       18,000 16,500 -     ?


             2:01Z  Rock Walls to Break after You've got Oxi <side-quest>
             ------------------------------------------------------------
             - First floor of Agua Tower [you need Tablet].
             - Auria-Bleak Passageway.
             - Third floor of Krypt where you can get the B.Rang [erm, just
               don't forget the Fife!].

             2:02A  Hidden Fort
             ------------------
             You can now go to that place that was completely blocked by
             rocks. This dungeon is full of mini-bosses yet you can still
             avoid them by breaking down certain walls.

             2:02B  Just Use Your Head and an Egg!
             -------------------------------------
             Nabal is your next primary destination but you can't enter
             until your forces have strengthened. If you got the B.Rang
             from Krypt using Ox's breaking ability al that can be sorted
             out! But its broken, so take it to the blacksmith's in Gant
             [you may have to talk to that old guy in the settlement a long
             way east of Gant first] then talk to the weapon collector.
             Or you may only have to repair the weapon.

             2:02C  Boss: Grim Fowl
             ----------------------       HP: 2,000 | EP: 4,200 | GP: 4,800
             In the forest between the hidden fort and Nabal is an egg that
             you can examine to initiate a fight. Basically what you're do-
             ing here is taming a bird, and an easy boss at that.

             2:02D  Herding a Flock of Birds to Nabal
             ----------------------------------------
             When you take the egg and leave the birds you may notice that
             they seem to *follow* you! And they do! Make sure they are at
             the end of your current party; only a couple will join at
             first but the other two will follow if you go slowly; and take
             a step or two back if they appear to be separating.

             2:02E  Nabal Fort
             -----------------
             You don't need to worry much, because most enemies have their
             full concentration on attending to their guests, your new pets
             -- but it's helpful to note that if you push the right pot of
             two just before the staircase; hidden where it was is an item
             and there's another in the other pot if you push it down.

             2:02F  Boss: Slime X
             --------------------
             The only thing I need say that's any different about this is
             that it will be useful to have Ryu equipped with B.Rang, as it
             can hit multiple enemies.

             2:02G  Oh, so that moving town in the Dessert is Wisdon is it?
             -------------------------------------------------------------
             Yes it it, first you need a certain statue, which, after talk-
             ing to the laid up guy in Prima can be found under his bed.
             The dungeon on the way to the sleeping sorceress is easy, only
             I got stuck in the big chamber with four sub-chambers -- I did
             not realise the exit was right above where you enter until I
             went to Auria and back.

             2:02H  Boss: Wisp, Cloud, then Myst
             -----------------------------------
                               Boss: Wisp | HP: 730 | EP: 1,200 | GP: 300
                            Boss: Cloud | HP: 1,400 | EP: 4,800 | GP: 1,200
                             Boss: Myst | HP: 1,100 | EP: 4,000 | GP: 3,600
             Wisp and Cloud are easy as they were last time, but Myst is a
             certifiable toughie -- with 1/10 of his HP left he'll cure
             himself 2/10; luckily, his HP will disappear if you attack him
             consistently.

             2:02I  Undersea Volcano
             -----------------------
             This place is quite far north from Prima.
             In the first floor you need to go all the way east, opposite
             for second floor and again east for third. Each floor seems to
             go in a circuit, so be careful to note where certain weeds are
             so you don't go back to one place too many times.

             2:02J  Boss: Pincher
             --------------------
             One major advantage you have with this battle is Bleu's Boom
             spell which takes over 100 from Pincher's HP [and there's not
             much of it, so all you need is three hits]. Though Ryu in his
             dragon form can take *far* more. You will need to take nearly
             400 HP to get this boogie over the brink.

             2:02K  The Sphere of the Ocean
             ------------------------------
             Talk to the guy in the Prima guild and he'll give you such a
             great item. Now whenever Gobi presses A you can go anywhere in
             the ocean, even across the big void next to the undersea volc-
             ano. By the way, after you do this you'll get different items
             via Gobi's shop.

             2:XXA  Back to Gobi's <side-quest>
             ---------------------
             Take Gobi behind the counter of his shop in Prima or Tunlan
             and you can find some great bargains, but you better hurry
             'cos there's limited time. Hold your horses, however, as most
             of the time you can get a better deal by refusing the first
             time; this seems to most frequently the case with Cure 2.

               - DarkDR: Decent weapon for Karn and Ryu/Zack. If you don't
                 need it you can still make a profit when it's sold.
               - Sleeper: Gobi's best weapon.
               - AgileHT: Okay equipment for the moment.
               - AngleAR: Get it for Nina [and Bleu when whe joins].
               - Cure 2: My personal favourite item! You can get great
                 deals on these.
               - G-Tiara: Refuse three times. Lowest price is 7,000 GP
                 which you can exploit in some of the more expensive shops
                 in Prima or Tunlan.

             2:02L  Tulan and the Best Rod Ever!!! <side-quest>
             -------------------------------------
             Tulan is on an island almost directly west of the gap in the
             ocean next to the undersea volcano. One [rather odd] thing you
             will encounter in the town's mansion is a whole lotta treasure
             surrounded by guards who'll throw you into holes if you try to
             get at it. It's not what it used to be like for thieves! Take
             the left one [you'll get nothing with the right]. In this room
             you *can* push a crate to fall down yet another hole, but if
             you examine the crate on the bottom right hand corner of the
             place you'll get a Rod5!

             2:0XA  Fishing Spots and their Catches <side-quest>
             --------------------------------------
             Bay east of Tunlan [lots of fish varieties available to catch]
             Hole east of Tunlan [nothing special]
             Hole east of Arad and Wisdon [nothing special]
             Hole past mountains east of Romero [Dragon Shield found here!]
             Pond in Spring [Dragon Armour found here!]
             Stone well west of Tantar [contains Slab].

             2:0XB  More training for Ryu <side-quest>
             ----------------------------
             Below the mountains south-east of the hidden fort and Nabal
             castle is another Dragon training centre where you fight a
             similar enemy you did last time [but only if you've got the
             Dragon Shield].

             2:02M  Gust: A Bridge to Scande...not yet!
             ------------------------------------------
             To get to gust from the ocean deep, just swim west until you
             reach the other side of the continent and follow the coast
             north until you get to a beach. The weapon shop in Gust has
             some great buys including a Moon Bow for Bo.

             2:02N  Karn learns Gebo <side-quest>
             -----------------------
             One of the houses in Gust have a crate that if you push it,
             you fall into a hole. There's a wizard there you will teach
             Karn a unique spell if you can push the pots out of the way to
             get to him. First you should get the first two of them out of
             the way by pushing them left or right. The three pots in a row
             all need to be pushed out of the way, but how? You need to
             push two while also making room for the third; the way you do
             this is push the ones an the left and right sides forward then
             push the one in the middle to the left or right.

             2:02O  Curse of the Dark Dragon Flower
             --------------------------------------
             North of Gust is a dungeon where you'll have to fight heaps of
             Rogues and finally their boss. You'll also have to fight some
             cockroaches to help the mice and revert to your usual form.

             2:02P  Exchange between Human and Frog
             --------------------------------------
             You need the oil of a frog and I know where you can get it,
             but before you rush off to the little cave not far away from
             Tulan island consider this; *what do the frogs what from you?*
             There's a small cave in Gust where a Giant Fly lives, and if
             you can kill it I'm sure those frogs would be in your debt! It
             is not a very easy monster [even using cheats, the game froze
             up...] as each of its hits will take most of a character's HP
             but if you heal and attack often you're sure to succeed!

             2:02Q  Destruction of the Poison Flower
             ---------------------------------------
             Once you take the oil to Bleu and go towards the "lab." again
             you'll have to fight yet another boss. FlowerX is Pretty hard
             considering; have antidotes on hand and throw all the fire you
             can at the fiend!

             2:02R  The Old Man's Flute
             --------------------------
             In one of the houses is an old man who's just been cured of
             the illness of the death flower and if you talk to him you can
             get a special item from "underneath" his bed!

             2:02S  Mogu's Curse
             -------------------
             There will be a few fights on the way out of Gust but you'll
             get there...eventually. West of Gust bridge is a village of
             moles. They request that you take a certain item to Tulan
             [first I think you need to get a special flute called the
             Maestro from some old geezer in Gust you you won't be able to
             understand the people of Tulan, or maybe it's the Cowl that
             does it...]

             2:02T  Getting the Bolster
             --------------------------
             The Princess of Tunlan has an item that'll enable you to enter
             Mogu's dreams and help him, but she's not willing to help you!
             Ironically she has some markings on her shoulders that will
             help you do it anyway, and the only way of seeing those mark-
             ings is watching her bathe at night. The small chamber with
             the two sets of stairs in it contains a crack, luckily, which
             you can use to slip into the princess' chamber at night and
             take a peek. "Blue, red and white from left to right," it
             says when you do. When you go back to the old woman a fight
             ensues, but after that you can take the Bolster from the chest
             farthest the right [just be careful -- there's a trap right in
             front of it that not even Karn can avoid so take it from the
             left].

             2:02U  Mogu's Chaotic Dream World and the Tower
             -----------------------------------------------
             This is a pretty cool place. Items and healing are really
             cheap and there's a house full of food [not that you can get
             to it...or that it'd be useful anyway.] The tower has green
             and pink switches that change the way you see the dungeon. The
             pink ones allow you to see it as it really is rather with the
             green ones you only see the floor. To get to the boy take your
             first left and continue until you meet the green switch and to
             make it easy, continue until you meet the pink switch then go
             back to the turn-off you went past; it will lead you to the
             boy more or less. Even if you accept to fight the him [and you
             can't win] you can still run from the battle.

             2:02V  Turning the Mindless Group into the Resolved Individual
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             South of the dream town is a cave where Courage is hidden. You
             will need to cross a minefield of bones and ghosts to get
             there though.

             2:02W  Facing his Demons
             ------------------------
             The second and third floor mazes are a little tougher. For the
             second there are two main chambers with staircases in them and
             you begin in the one to the right. In the third floor you'll
             need to follow a path to the east, making sure that you enter
             a [slightly] disguised path to the right which will take you
             where you need to go.

             2:02X  Boss: Mothro
             -------------------          HP: 3,500 | EP: 6,000 | GP: 8,000
             With this enemy's poison and stop attacks as well as the
             occasional killer attack you really need to supervise this
             battle.

             2:02Y  Places to Dig
             --------------------
             - Gramor plains [mostly worms but you get a few Lifes too].
             - On the hills near Camlon you'll another guy to teach Karn.
             - In the hills north-east of Tantar you'll find some items.
             - A digging site just north of Auria with worms and charms.
             - Quite a few places east of Carmen.

             2:02Z  About to Spring and Spyre Tower
             --------------------------------------
             South of Gramor is a cave that leads to a town and a tower
             [you have to dig to get into the tower]. It's an easy dungeon
             in terms of maze cracking until you get near the very top with
             the single line in darkness... It's hard to give a guide but I
             can give you advice; Every button will have a little moving
             thing to help you get your bearings as well and where your
             character is pointing helps too. In the next puzzle maze foll-
             ow these steps (there are traps all over the place, so use
             Karn); [1] take the right set of stairs, [2] walk to the east-
             ern wall, one step away from the south-easternmost corner; [3]
             take the bottom right stair of the four grouped here.

             2:02Z  Boss: Mote
             -----------------            HP: 3,500 | EP: 5,400 | GP: 6,000
             His worst attack is Inferno, so try to use equipment that pro-
             tects against fire. One thing you should use to your advantage
             is that this boss's image can become clearer or more grainy at
             various stages; when clear he is weak against magic, when
             blurry only attacks will work. So you should have a balanced
             team for this.

             2:03A  Tick Tock
             ----------------
             Your next area is accessible via the waterfall in Spring. The
             tower on the big hill east of Carmen is one big puzzle area
             and you'll have to go to the top twice. Those arrows are funny
             ...

             2:03B  Boss: Cerl [the Surly ^_^]
             -----------------            HP: 3,500 | EP: 8,000 | GP: 9,000
             Yeah whatever... This boss is so easy that you can probably
             even put your characters on auto-pilot. For any battle
             my personal favourites are Ryu, Nina, Bleu and Karn.

             2:03C  Softening Cerl's Heart with an Apple
             -------------------------------------------
             Alan speaks of a town he and Cerl used to live in and a fruit
             that she liked. Using Ox one can get this fruit from the tree
             next to the ruined village south of Carmen. Upon taking this
             to Cerl you can finally get the Time Key! Woo hoo!

             2:03D  Saving Carmen & the Nina Effect
             --------------------------------------
             After going up the blasted Tock tower *again,* you'll find
             that there is a strange guy in Tunlan and Carmen, one next to
             the dragon Shrine and other next to the easternmost house.
             After the one in Carmen disappears examine where he stood.
             Talk to the old man in one of the houses with the windmills in
             them, exit, re-enter and talk again; he'll tell you to collect
             some items for a special tonic which will be useful in curing
             Nina's amnesia [she's the little girl who fell from the sky in
             Tunlan]. When you've come back and got the tonic from him you
             can give it to Nina in Tunlan!

             2:03E  Collecting items for a Tonic
             -----------------------------------
             P.Fish: Fish on the end of the bridge in lake south of Carmen.
             W.Ant: Find in the chest of drawers at Carmen inn.
             C.Nut: Have Ox knock the palm trees surrounding Tunlan.
             Root: Have Mogu dig under weird plants surrounding Gramor.

Note: After you give the tonic to Nina in Tunlan the old items you got at
      Gobi's shop will mostly be replaced with new ones, so organise your
      affairs in that area before you continue please...

             2:XXB  Back to Gobi's Again <side-quest>
             ---------------------------
             You should know by now about Gobi and his shops in Tunlan and
             Prima. This is the final stage.

             - PowerRP: Nina's most powerful weapon, yipee!
             - MaskSH: One of better shields on offer.
             - EvilRB: Good armour for Nina or Bleu.
             - Mallet: Ox's best weapon.
             - GlowCN: Bleu's best weapon.
             - DwarfBW: Bo's best weapon.
             - G-Tiara: Good for money-making.
             - Cure 2 x9: This is actually Life x9.

             2:03F  New Places you can Fly <side-quest>
             -----------------------------
             - Islands north of Romero.
             - Dragon Shrine north of Gust.
             - Mole hole on peninsula south of Scande.
             - The home of a female weapon collector directly north of the
               male one and on an island west of Tantar.

             2:03G  Ryu learns Rudra Spell <side-quest>
             -----------------------------
             If you've fished out the Dragon Armour from the pond in Spring
             you will now be able to go to the Dragon Shrine north of Gust
             and put Ryu into some more training. I would suggest Bolt
             Dragon for this [though even at level 25 it's cutting it
             close].

             2:03H  Get the Iron Claw
             ------------------------
             Remember that guy who was a weapon collector. Well, if you go
             directly north of where he lives until you come to an island
             that you couldn't reach until now you'll meet his female
             counterpart! Go between them for a while [the chests must be
             got via both their beds and by moving pots] and eventually you
             will be given the I.Claw.

             2:03I  Fixing the broken parts
             ------------------------------
             You'll be able to get into Scande if you have the Pass, which
             is found in Carmen next to a water trowel. The elevator in the
             tower is broken, but some guy in Spring has the parts and an-
             other in Gant can fix them.

             2:03J  Getting the D.Hrt
             ------------------------
             You will need to get this item from a girl in Tunlan [her
             house is directly north from the entrance of the town] after
             talking to the guy at the entrance of the tower. Hearing the
             song will reduce Ryu's HP to 1 btw.

             2:03K  Climbing Scande Tower
             ----------------------------
             This is a creepy place in terms of aesthetics but easy in term
             of game-play. Chairs everywhere, evidence that people obvious-
             ly visit...yet with the prison-like surroundings and levered
             gaol bars all over the place...

             2:03L  Boss: Zog
             ----------------            HP: 16,000 | EP: 7,000 | GP: 7,000
             My favourites for this battle are Ryu and Karn; the others I
             merely use as Cure jockeys, because you do need to heal quite
             often to win. I reckon Zog has over 3,000 HP in desperation
             mode.

             2:03M  Agua Tower and Beyond
             ----------------------------
             Now you can go past that area you that was barred before! How
             Exciting! There'll be a teleport to a new dungeon which you
             have to explore...

             2:03N  Boss: Sara
             -----------------           HP: 15,000 | EP: 8,000 | GP: 8,000
             In her Dragon form Sara is one hellava monster! Keep strong,
             heal often and you'll get there. 

             2:03N  Teaching Mogu to use the Iron Claw
             -----------------------------------------
             If Mogu speaks with the master digger in Gramor he will learn
             how to use the I.Claw [and so let you finish the game]. This
             will be useful for the excavation cave in Scande and getting
             into the obelisk [erm...they are the same place...]

             2:03O  Ryu's Agni Spell <side-quest>
             -----------------------
             After fishing in the well west of Arad and getting the Dragon
             Hat you can enter the Ease Cave to find a Dragon Shrine and
             gain the ultimate power!

             2:03P  Obelisk Maze
             -------------------
             You'll come to a place where you'll have to choose right or
             left [choose the former rather than the latter]. In the next
             juncture use the bottom one unless of course you want a Flame
             HR. Where you meet that guy take the left turn.

             2:03Q  Boss: Goda
             -----------------           HP: 11,000 | EP: 6,000 | GP: 6,000
             With Ryu's ultimate form you're virtually a boss-like monster
             yourself; his desperation mode takes *ages* to overcome, about
             6,000 extra HP you need to get rid of.

             2:03R  Obelisk Maze continued
             -----------------------------
             You'll come to a platform where all transports lead to the
             same place. The path is reasonably straitforward and your
             target is the staircase in the middle of the room; go down the
             next set of steps you find.

             2:03S  Boss: Jade
             -----------------           HP: 25,000 | EP: 8,000 | GP: 8,000
             If you answer "yes" to Jade's question he'll get you to fight
             a monster, after each battle if you press a button he'll ask
             again and make you fight another monster if you say "yes." I
             don't see the point of doing this other than getting 9,999 EXP
             from M.Slime.

             2:03T  Boss: Goddess
             --------------------              HP: 16,000 | EP: 10 | GP: 12
             The ending of the game depends on how you play this battle.
             Before it starts she'll ask if you came here to have a wish
             granted, so say yes to get healed.
               During the battle, if you use Agni to defeat her you will
             win the battle. The Goddess you defeat must look like a
             mutated alien, her true form.
               If you fail to use Agni and the Goddess still looks like a
             deranged girl when you defeat her you'll get the bad ending.
               This is one of those games where the end boss is actually
             the hardest, especially after having fought a couple of
             toughies beforehand... She becomes much easier when you use
             Agni on her and she turns into her ugly form.

 CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE COMPLETED THE FIRST OF THREE BREATH OF FIRE GAMES!
         WILL YOU TRY YOUR LUCK AT THE NEXT ONE?? I KNOW I WON'T.


    2:00  SIDE-QUESTS
---------------------

             2:01J  Boss: Talon
             ------------------
             There's a Dragon Training Hall just south of the Volcano where
             Ryu can gain three shiny new spells! Even though it's a one-on
             -one battle you'll probably find that it's not hard. I won at
             level 17 and Ryu was twice as strong as his enemy.

             2:01L  The Fairies and the Cutting of their Trees
             -------------------------------------------------
             This will involve quite a lot of to-ing and fro-ing from Auria
             to the fairy woods near the dragon training centre. 1) Talk to
             the fairies in their wood [you'll need Bo to get there] and
             the pattern of flowers on the world map that looks like a
             square; 2) Talk to the woman in the mansion to the north-west
             in Auria; 3) Go back to the fairy woods and tell them you'll
             revert that bad boy's habits for good; 4) Go and talk to the
             boy; 5) Return to the mother; she'll give you 20,000 G.

             2:0AA  See Chun-Li from Street Fighter
             --------------------------------------
             There's a guy in Bleak you offers to show you a magic trick
             for 100 G. Say YES to him the first 2 times and every other
             option say NO and you'll see Chun-li doing her "Lightening
             Kick."

             2:01Q  New Doors to Open
             ------------------------
             - The locked chamber in Winlan castle just before the bridge.
             - On the top floor of Agua Tower there's a section you
               could not go to before. In the chamber with the statues of
               dragons you can examine them to get some really awesome
               equipment.
             - Various doors in the Bleak-Auria Passageway.

             2:01Z  Rock Walls to Break after You've got Oxi
             -----------------------------------------------
             - First floor of Agua Tower [you need Tablet].
             - Auria-Bleak Passageway.
             - Third floor of Krypt where you can get the B.Rang [erm, just
               don't forget the Fife!].

             2:02L  Tulan and the Best Rod Ever!!!
             -------------------------------------
             Tulan is on an island almost directly west of the gap in the
             ocean next to the undersea volcano. One [rather odd] thing you
             will encounter in the town's mansion is a whole lotta treasure
             surrounded by guards who'll throw you into holes if you try to
             get at it. It's not what it used to be like for thieves! Take
             the left one [you'll get nothing with the right]. In this room
             you *can* push a crate to fall down yet another hole, but if
             you examine the crate on the bottom right hand corner of the
             place you'll get a Rod5!

             2:0XA  Fishing Spots and their Catches
             --------------------------------------
             Bay east of Tunlan [lots of fish varieties available to catch]
             Hole east of Tunlan [nothing special]
             Hole east of Arad and Wisdon [nothing special]
             Hole past mountains east of Romero [Dragon Shield found here!]

             2:0XB  More training for Ryu
             ----------------------------
             Below the mountains south-east of the hidden fort and Nabal
             castle is another Dragon training centre where you fight a
             similar enemy you did last time [but only if you've got the
             Dragon Shield].

             2:02N  Karn learns Gebo
             -----------------------
             One of the houses in Gust have a crate that if you push it,
             you fall into a hole. There's a wizard there you will teach
             Karn a unique spell if you can push the pots out of the way to
             get to him. First you should get the first two of them out of
             the way by pushing them left or right. The three pots in a row
             all need to be pushed out of the way, but how? You need to
             push two while also making room for the third; the way you do
             this is push the ones an the left and right sides forward then
             push the one in the middle to the left or right.

             A:00A  Ryu/Zack
             ---------------
             The hero can learn his spells at various stages of the game
             and only after completing certain requirements and defeating
             the challenge in a Dragon shrine [Ryu only!]. They must be
             done in order btw.

              1. After you defeat Talon you can get SnoDr, FlmDr and ThrDr.
              2. After you defeat Bain you can get IceDgn, FirDgn, BltDgn
                 and GldDgn.
              3. After you defeat Avian you can defeat Rudra.
              4. In Ease Cave you can find the shrine in the underwater
                 part and get Agni.

              Ryu can also go fishing, as long as he's got a rod equipped
              as a weapon and is in the lead of the party when you examine
              a fishing well or beach with fish in it.

             A:00B  Nina
             -----------
             This princess is a heavy magic-user and all her spells are got
             via levelling up. Towards the end of the game she'll magically
             grow up so you can fly on her!

             A:00C  Bo
             ---------
             Bo learns virtually no new spells when you get him and though
             he's useful at times to go through forests his main power will
             be via Karn later in the game.
               His special ability is to hunt all those animals that appear
             on the world map at certain times of the day, netting you meat
             and a couple of other things.
               You can also go through forests with him in the front of the
             party.

             A:00D  Karn
             -----------
             Karn's spells involve transforming into two or more other
             members of the party, giving all the weak characters except
             Mogu a use... You can get the spells from side-quests only...
             Everyone still gets the same EP at the end of the battle, and
             while transformed outside of battle, Karn can use the other
             characters' special abilities.

             - Shin [Bo + Gobi]: Man in Gant.
             - Debo [Ox + Gobi]: Man in Gust.
             - Doof [Bo + Ox]: Man in dirt patch north of Camlon. Talk to
               him with Mogu in the lead.
             - Puka [Bo + Ox + Gobi]: House north of the Dragon Shrine
               near bleak. Use Doof to push a big crate out of the way and
               talk to the man there.

               With Karn at the lead of the party you won't fall into any
             traps or have to use keys to open doors/chests.

             A:00E  Gobi
             -----------
             All of Gobi's significant abilities are non-battle related,
             like being able to set up shop in Prima and Tunlan (just walk
             up to the empty counter and press A), and being able to turn
             into a big fish that everyone travels while in the ocean after
             getting the crystal sphere.

             A:00F  Ox
             ---------
             A physically strong character, Ox may have the might of the
             aformentioned animal, but he also has the agility and intell-
             igence of one.
               His special abilities involve knocking things down, like
             earthen walls in dungeons and fruit trees (coconut, apple...).

             A:00G  Bleu
             -----------
             Bleu is the opposite of Nina, meaning the more you level her
             up the more her repetoire of powerful offensive spells grows.
             She's so good she doesn't need any special abilities, or maybe
             Capcom were just lazy.

             A:00H  Mogu
             -----------
             This character is like Gobi in the way he isn't great in
             battle, but his dig abilities allow him to find items under
             the earth (anywhere there are claw marks) and escape battles
             easily.

      A:02  Special Abilities

      A:03  Background (spoiler alert!)
      ---------------------------------

            A:03A  Ryu
            ----------
              Height: 160 cm (5'3")
              Weight: 52 kg (114 lbs.)
               Hobby: Fishing
            Hometown: Drogan (change the "o" into an "a" and whaddya get?)
                Past: He and his sister have lived in the town of Drogan
                      Ryu's whole life. Their parents had died in the Godd-
                      ess War that saw Zog take control of the world.
                        Now the ruling clan of Dark Dragons have their
                      sights set on defeating the clan of Light Dragons,
                      who Ryu and his sister belong to.
                        When they arrive they cast impenetratable fire on
                      Drogan and the only person there with the power of
                      the dragon is Ryu's sister.
                        She turns everyone into stone so they can survive
                      the burning flames and turn back to find their town
                      in ruins but at least not to be captured by Zog's men
                      ... but to draw their attention away from the others
                      she had to allow herself to be captured.
                        As the only Light Dragon left capable of taking on
                      the Dark Dragons Ryu is the world's only hope of def-
                      eating Zog...

            A:03B  Nina
            -----------
              Height: 158 cm (5'2")
              Weight: 45 kg (99 lbs.)

               Hobby: Travelling
            Hometown: Tantar/Tuntar
                Past: Leader of the armies of the Forest Clan, Bo has
                      fought the Dark Dragons on many occasions and been
                      forced to retreat, and that is why he will join Ryu.

            A:03D  Karn
            -----------
              Height: 154 cm (5'1")
              Weight: 48 kg (105 lbs.)
               Hobby: Collecting shoes
            Hometown: Bleak
                Past: As a young boy Karn was found and raised by the lead-
                      er of the thieves in Bleak and has strived to become
                      the best thief since then. That's how he met and join
                      ed Ryu, Nina and Bo.

              Weight: 110 kg (242 lbs.)
               Hobby: Making money

                Past: Gobi's clan is the Manillos, who are fishlike and
                      have a goal to take over the world in commerce. Gobi
                      joins you in order to be able to get a sphere and be
                      able to transform into a big fish so he can travel
                      the ocean more quickly, for he was barred from using
                      them by the clan, who agreed to lift it if he helped
                      Ryu.

            A:03F  Ox
            ---------
              Height: 250 cm (8'2")
              Weight: 200 kg (440 lbs.)

                      people who use their dextrosity to make weaponry and
                      armour, although they are peaceful and would prefer
                      making things like food implements.

            A:03G  Bleu
            -----------
              Height: ??
              Weight: ??
               Hobby: Dreaming
            Hometown: Unknown
                Past: A sorceress famed by all the clans for being very
                      powerful, yet she spends most of time in a deep coma,
                      in a sleep she seems to enjoy greatly. Though she had
                      to awake to lend her ability to Ryu.


            A:03H  Mogu

                      a curse Mogu is facing that is related to their quest
                      and after that Mogu is a lot of help when they're in
                      Scande, for they have to deal with his secretive clan
                      members.

-------------------------
            C:12A  How to Hunt
            ------------------
            - You need Bo or Karn to be able to hunt, as they can shoot
              arrows at those animals on the world map.
            - If you shoot just as the animal is about to jump, the animal
              will jump underneath the arrow and you can get its spoils
              without killing it, so you can get unlimited spoils.

             Notes: - Camlon only has shops after you've defeated Zog
                    - When I say "best" and "worst" it refers to the fact
                      that you can get the item from more than one shop in
                      that town.

             ------------------
             In Prima and Tunlan there are shops that apparently have no
             proprietors, only if Gobi is at the head of your party and he
             is allowed to trade again you can walk behind the counter and
             begin working with customers. There are various items you can
             get depending on what part of the game you're in.
               When they're driving "a hard bargain" it means you can go no
             further the sale.

             Note:
              Stage 1 Lasts until you get the sphere for Gobi
              Stage 2 Lasts until you cure Nina's amnesia
              Stage 3 Lasts until you finish the game

              Advice:
               - Store all your items while you're trading, you'll find
                 the trading process gets easier whilst your inventory is
                 empty.
               - Be persistant and aim to get a minimum number of items in
                 one sitting as things will be more efficient this way.
               - Only ever accept an offer when they're driving a "hard
                 bargain," not only will you have more kudos as a tough
                 salesman but you won't fill up your inventory unnecessar-
                 ily -- I know it sounds counter-intuitive to the sort of
                 hording you tend to do with games -- but you'll end up
                 getting more and better items if you're patient anyway.
               - Keep a close eye on the offers they've made and
                 comparisons, because the game will sometimes make an offer
                 on the same item that's worse than the last...

      Useful Item Code Info
      ---------------------
      Like with most Square games for SNES, the item codes tend to begin
      with 7E [actually, this seems to be the case with most of the useful
      codes]. You add any number from 00 to 8D to the address 7E5140 and
      there's a second code whose address is 7D5141 determines the type and
      volume of the item. 01 added to the end says that it's a normal item,
      11 for weapons and 21 for all other equipment; the number at the end
      of the address decides the volume of items there are so you can only
      put in 1~9].

      Character Stat Codes
      --------------------
      I have to be honest, these are the codes that made Breath of Fire
      worthwhile for me to play [along with unlimited HP, AP and GP]. Codes
      such as these tend to be all the same except for a single HEX value
      [as pretty much all codes are hexadecimal, meaning that numbers go in
      increments of 16 rather than 10].
        If one is familiar with the HEX order of numbers they'll know
      that the next group of codes are all the same except the final value
      in the address segment of the code going from 57 to 63 on the hex
      scale [that's 57 for Str, 58 for Vig, 59 for Wis, 5A for Agi, 5B for
      Mag, 5C for luck, 5D and 5E for Att, 5F and 60 for Def, 61 for Int,
      62 for Fate, 63 for Act...and the numbers continue for the rest of
      your party until they run out].

      7E1057 FF : 1st Character has max Str.
      
      
      Miscellaneous
      -------------
      7E1090 00 :  No random battles

      7E0FB1 FF :  65,535 EXP per battle

      7E104C E7 :  1st Character has max HP
      7E104D 03

      7E1050 E7 :  1st Character has max AP
      7E1051 03

    F:01  Breath of Fire Sequels
--------------------------------
    I have both Breath of Fire I & II; they are both available for Game Boy
    Advance and Super Nintendo. I'm also aware there's a Breath of Fire III
    for PlayStation, though I've never seen in myself. What's weird about
    the first sequel is that it seems that all of the characters have the
    the same names -- yet they're very different. But I haven't got far in
    my game, only "Ryu" and "Bow" (as in Bow Wow) are in the party.

    F:02  The Meanings Behind the Names
---------------------------------------

    Bleu
    ----
    The French word for blue. Explains her hair I guess.

    Ryu
    ---
    The Japanese word for dragon; that's why Street Fighter's Ryu has an
    affinity with dragons too. And all the other Ryus...

    Tyr
    ---
    In Viking Mythology he is the god of war, and where we get Tuesday
    from. Tyr's Day, or Tiw's Day.


    F:03  How BoF for GBA is Different
--------------------------------------
    Interface
    ---------
    - Not as much abbreviation is needed as in the SNES version, partic-
      ularly when it comes to item names. The menus are more cramped look-
      ing though.
    - You can do a quick save anywhere you like outside of battle and story
      scenes. When you've done a quick save the game resets, prompting you
      to choose whether or not you'll load the quick save at the title
      screen; load it and it's automatically deleted after loading, press
      "NO" and it'll be deleted without loading (so take care).
    - When buying you can trade in equipment, meaning that if you're buying
      a weapon the game will show the price of the weapon, buy your old
      weapon and replace it with the new.
        The wierd thing is When the game prompts a "yes" or "no" to the
      deal you cannot avoid it even if you say "no," you can only press B
      to see how much your old weapon is being sold for. So be careful.
    - The EP and GP you get from monsters is always higher.
    - Brighter colours.
    - It's easier to play overall.
