###############################################################################

In this document, you will find the various statistics and properties of all
the monsters contained in the game data, including a dummy monster named PET.
For completeness and contiguity, I have decided to include information on the
battle scripts in this writing. While the statistics should be accurate, I
cannot guarantee that the same applies to the battle scripts. Unfortunately,
these have been written in pure assembly, and were scattered throughout the
sprite animation code. Therefore, it is possible that I may have made a mistake
or overlooked something in the process.

The information is taken from a ROM of the SNES version. Tests have revealed
that certain monsters in the GBA game were greatly rebalanced from the original
version. For example, Frog has 180 HP and 20 DEF in this version; in the GBA
game, it only has 138 HP and 15 DEF. Another example would be that the P.Bug
critter no longer has a perfect chance to use a special attack, a trait
apparently inherited from the Super Famicom version.

Most of the information contained in the next section is self-explanatory, so
there is no need to explain what all the keywords and terminology stand for.
The points that need clarification are listed below.

Special attack:
This is, simply put, any attack except a monster's normal physical attack. When
an attack name is enclosed within square brackets, it indicates that the attack
does not have a name, as it is of a physical nature. Therefore, the name that
is provided is purely descriptive. Note that all special attacks are ineligible
for the "Slam" process. This includes cases in which the monster is forced to
use a normal attack because it lacks the AP needed to cast a given spell.

Probabilities for monsters to use a special attack do not take into account the
probability for them to use a recovery spell when they reach critical HP. When
there is more than one probability listed, it indicates that the probability
varies each round. Let's use the probabilities assigned to Stool as an example.
They are as follows: "{6.25%, 100%}." One can conclude from that list that the
probability for said monster to use a special attack is 6.25% on odd-numbered
rounds, and 100% on even-numbered rounds.

Phases:
As you may have surmised, certain monsters have the capacity to escape death.
This is due to the fact that their hit points are split between two phases.
Wherever applicable, the HP values for both phases are enclosed in parentheses
and separated with a semi-colon. When such a monster's HP drops to zero, the
following events happen: a message is displayed, the round ends, and a second
set of HP is assigned to the enemy. This is where Phase 2 begins. Note that the
monster's health bar always remains empty during this phase.

Critical HP:
This status is applied to monsters whose hit points are reduced to 12.5% or
less of the maximum value through a non-phase-ending attack. It can only be
applied during Phase 1. If it is activated before Phase 1 comes to an end,
Critical HP status will remain on the enemy until the end of battle. Monsters
in critical HP status deal 131.25% normal damage when using a physical attack.
Note that any monster with the ability to use a recovery spell when under the
influence of this status can only do so during Phase 1.

Infinite AP bug:
Because of a bug in the code, the AP of certain enemies can drop below 0, which
translates into approximately 65535, depending on the spell's AP cost. One side
effect of this is the repercussions it can have on the algorithm for the Drain
spell, as the attack is less effective against targets that have next to no AP.

Drop item:
Nothing much to say here, except for the fact that only the last monster
defeated has a chance to drop an item.

AB priority:
When the AB command is used, the characters always attack the monster with the
highest "AB priority" rating. This excludes cases in which Karn or Ryu are
present and take the shape of Puka or any dragon except SnoDr, FlmDr, or ThrDr.

Element:
Now, this is awkward. Not only does a monster's element symbolize the attribute
of all of its physical attacks, it embodies its elemental weakness. Obviously,
the programmers subscribe to the "fight fire with fire" ideal. Since the element
names are presently unknown, arbitrary names have been assigned to the elements.

EP and GP:
One of the lesser-known features is how the party receives more EP and GP than
normal when the enemy group is dispatched relatively expeditiously. The list
below describes the correlation between the amount by which the EP and GP
values are multiplied and the number of rounds required to win the battle.

Round  Multiplier
1      150%
2-4    130.078125%
5-6    120.3125%
7+     100%

Special attack: [Red Breath]
Aiming: One random character
Evasion and counterattack: Disabled
Probability: 43.75%

NOTE: When using a normal attack, Pog has a 50% chance of attacking both Nina
      and Ryu. Otherwise, it will target the westernmost character exclusively.

      When the monster uses a normal attack, the algorithm chooses a character
      randomly to determine whether there shall be retaliation and whether the
      westernmost character shall evade the attack. Consequently, Ryu cannot
      retaliate when Nina is the character that is chosen, and he is capable of
      counterattacking even when he is not under attack. Additionally, the
      easternmost character cannot evade normal attacks unless alone.

      In Phase 2, all attack decisions are translated into a normal attack that
      will target both Nina and Ryu. Naturally, when it is classed as a special
      attack, the converted attack is ineligible for the "Slam" process.
