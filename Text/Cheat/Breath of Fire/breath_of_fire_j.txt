 ZACK (a.k.a. Ryu from SNES games)
 ¯¯¯¯
   This sword-wielder hails from the town of Drogen, which gets wrecked by the
   Dark Dragon clan within the first minute of gameplay. His clan has powers
   of the Light Dragon or, rather, did -- they've lost 'em! But, it's his duty
   to defeat Zog, Dark Dragon King, whose wreaking havoc all 'round the world.
   
   [SKILLS:]

    - SnoDr -------->  7 AP. Transforms into ice-elemental dragon.
    - FlmDr --------> 10 AP. Transforms into fire-elemental dragon.
    - ThrDr --------> 12 AP. Transforms into thunder-elemental dragon.
    - IceDgn -------> 20 AP. Transforms into powerful ice-elemental dragon.
    - FirDgn -------> 27 AP. Transforms into powerful fire-elemental dragon.
    - BltDgn -------> 30 AP. Transforms into powerful thndr-elemental dragon.
    - GldDgn -------> 40 AP. Transforms into powerful zombie-killing dragon.
    - Rudra --------> 50 AP. Transforms into powerful fire-elemental dragon.
    - Agni ---------> 60 AP. Transforms into ultimate dragon
    - Revert -------> 0 AP. Returns to normal (in-battle, while transformed)

    NOTE: Zack can only learn transformations at Dragon Temples/Shrines.
    NOTE: Agni calls for everyone to merge; Karn cannot be fused with anyone!

   [FISHING:]

    This is Zack's unique ability, letting him fish for items on the field.
    Sometimes he gets fish, but the real purpose of this is to get the Dragon
    Relics. If you find an old well or odd dock, fishing off of it may just be
    the key to getting a good piece of equipment. He needs to have a Rod and
    Bait (both items) equipped to his accessory slot to fish.



 NINA
 ¯¯¯¯
    Winged princess of the Winlan Kingdom, she takes it upon herself to go and
    defeat the wizard causing harm in Karma/Romero. Eventually she joins up
    with Zack after he's helped her out. Her specialty is healing magicks, so
    she's always useful in a bind...provided she doesn't get herself killed in
    an instance due to low defense.

    [SKILLS:]

     Lv. ---- Cura1 ---> Recovers HP by 50pts. 
     Lv. ---- Fort ----> Briefly ups defense power. 
     Lv. ---- Heal ----> Cures any abnormal statuses. 
     Lv. 06 - Lk-Up ---> Briefly ups Luck stat. 
     Lv. 07 - Atk-Up --> Briefly ups Attack power. 
     Lv. 09 - Cura2 ---> Recovers HP by 100pts.
     Lv. 11 - Hold ----> Holds enemy move (paralysis)
     Lv. 12 - Ag-Up ---> Briefly ups agility
     Lv. 13 - Warp ----> Warps to a town (ones party's previously visited)
     Lv. 14 - Zom1 ----> Angel Lv1. Single enemy. (damages undead)
     Lv. 15 - Cura3 ---> Recovers HP by 250pts.
     Lv. 17 - Renew ---> Cures "Stun" State with 1 HP
     Lv. 19 - Idle ----> Slows enemy down (lowers agility?)
     Lv. 21 - Shield --> Lessens damage from magic
     Lv. 23 - Cura4 ---> Fully recovers HP
     Lv. 24 - Zom2 ----> Angel Lv2. Single enemy.
     Lv. 26 - FortX ---> Ups party's defense power
     Lv. 28 - Hush ----> Briefly seals enemy's magic
     Lv. 30 - Dispel --> Prevents an enemy from using magic (one casting)
     Lv. 34 - RegenX --> Revives character in "Stun" state w/ full HP
     Lv. 41 - Wall ----> Reflects magical attacks off ally
     Lv. 46 - ZomX ----> Angel Lv3. All enemies.

    [FLYING:]
    
     This is Nina's special power. Unfortunately for the player, she doesn't
     gain the ability until very late in the game, after visiting one certain
     time-influencing tower... However, when she does get it, it allows the
     party to land anywhere they'd be able to walk normally, as well as search
     out treasure spots they'd normally be unable to get to.



 BO
 ¯¯
    A member of the Forest Clan who led the army of Tantar to many victories.
    After events in Lament Woods, he joins the party permanently, giving them
    a much-needed edge on the Dark Dragon forces -- great attacking and magic!
    He suffers from a defensive problem, though...

   [SKILLS:]

    Lv. ---- Flare ---> Fire Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Spark ---> Thunder Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Cold ----> Ice Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Fry -----> Thunder Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Flame ---> Fire Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Frost ---> Ice Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Cura1 ---> Recovers HP by 50pts.

   [HUNTING:]

    Bo's special ability uses his bow-and-arrow setups to kill monsters on the
    field. If successful, he can pick up what's left of them -- these items
    are oftentimes of great use, like the W. Ant (heals AP by 100) or the Meat
    dropped by boars (heals all party's HP some). These items can't be sorted
    in the inventory, unfortunately...

   [FOREST-WALKING]

    Bo's got another ability! If you place him in the party lead, he can trek
    through the pines, to places otherwise unaccessible. This is the only way
    to get around early on, particularly near Romero.



 KARN
 ¯¯¯¯
    Karn's a low-down dirty theif from Bleak, who just wants to be the best in
    his trade. He joins after completing the Krypt dungeon, and is a big asset
    in the ways of treasure-hunting with his lockpick and fusion abilities.

   [SKILLS:]

    NOTE: All fusion abilities increase damage/defense in battle.

    Shin ---> Fusion that combines him, Gobi, and Bo. Faster hunting on the
              world map and also forest-walking abilities retained.

    Debo ---> Fusion that combines him, Gobi, and Ox. Only available under the
              water, which makes it pretty dumb once you don't need to travel
              that way any longer. No special abilities...

    Doof ---> Fusion that combines him, Ox, and Bo. Only available on land, so
              it's the exact opposite of Debo. Can still walk through forests.

    Puka ---> Combines him, Gobi, Ox, and Bo. Doesn't retain any abilities but
              Karn's (IIRC). His special ability is opening dragon-crested
              doors on the world map, and having great battle fortitude. >=p

   [LOCKPICKING:]

    Karn's a lockpick master, meaning he can open up any locked gates you find
    in the game (well, almost all of them).

   [TRAP DISARMING]

    Karn's also an adept thief and can smell traps a mile away. This includes
    disarming treasure chests that have nasty after-effects and also trapdoors
    which can cause the party to lose progress.



 BLEU
 ¯¯¯¯
    Bleu, to put it simply, is a bangin' sorceress with the body of a snake.
    Her magickal skills are peerless, and she has quite an arsenal to unleash
    on the unsuspecting enemy hordes. It's all offensive, though; if she had
    white magick, she would definitely be THE best.

   [SKILLS:]

    Lv. ---- Exit ------> Escapes from a dungeon to world map
    Lv. ---- Flare -----> Fire Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Spark -----> Thunder Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Cold ------> Ice Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- 3.5 -------> Quake Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Para ------> Stops enemy's time
    Lv. ---- Bomb ------> Explosion Lv. 1, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Sap -------> Absorb an enemy's HP
    Lv. ---- Warp ------> Warp to a previously-visited town
    Lv. ---- Rub -------> Kills an enemy with "Shock!" (works ~50% of time)
    Lv. ---- Flame -----> Fire Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Fry -------> Thunder Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Frost -----> Ice Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- 5.5 -------> Quake Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. ---- Boom ------> Explosion Lv. 2, single enemy
    Lv. 20 - F.Ball ----> Fire Lv. 3, single enemy
    Lv. 21 - LStorm ----> Thunder Lv. 4, enemy group
    Lv. 22 - Chill -----> Ice Lv. 4, enemy group
    Lv. 23 - Flee ------> Flees from battle
    Lv. 24 - 9.5 -------> Quake Lv. 3, enemy group
    Lv. 25 - Blast -----> Explosion Lv. 3, single enemy
    Lv. 26 - Gale ------> Thunder Lv. 5, enemy group
    Lv. 28 - Ice -------> Ice Lv. 4, enemy group
    Lv. 29 - Char ------> Fire Lv. 5, enemy group
    Lv. 30 - Nova ------> Explosion Lv. 4, enemy group
    Lv. 31 - IceX ------> Ice Lv. 5, enemy group
    Lv. 32 - FireX -----> Ice Lv. 4, enemy group
    Lv. 33 - Drain -----> Absorb enemy's AP
    Lv. 35 - BoltX -----> Thunder Lv. 3, single enemy
    Lv. 37 - NovaX -----> Explosion Lv. 5, single enemy
    Lv. 40 - Comet -----> Meteor Storm, enemy group


 GOBI
 ¯¯¯¯
    Gobi is a thrifty fish-man who used to be a prominent member of the Prima
    Guild. He set up shop in Auria, the town of riches, and eventually tags
    along with the party since he has business elsewhere. Well, he eventually
    ends up as the party's guide and joins them.

   [SKILLS:]

    NOTE: His skills can ONLY be used underwater

    Ebb -----> Attacks all enemy ranks with fish schools
    EbbX ----> Attacks all enemy ranks with fish schools
    Eco -----> Attacks all enemy ranks with fish schools
    EcoX ----> Attacks all enemy ranks with fish schools

   [BIG FISH:]

    After receiving the 'Sphere' item, Gobi will once again be allowed to use
    the Big Fish ability of his clan. This lets him traverse any part of the
    ocean, but is mostly useful for getting to the western part.

 OX
 ¯¯
    Ox is a member of the Gant machinists, a people who mine and overhaul 
    machines. He's a really big powerhouse, and his wife was kidnapped when
    the Dark Dragons came to their village. He attempts to get to the Hidden
    Base, but ends up in the underwater town of Prima where he joins Zack in
    his quest to destroy the evil clan.

   [SKILLS:]

    Lv. ---- Cura3 --> Recovers HP by 250pts.
    Lv. ---- Heal ---> Cures any abnormal statuses

   [WALL-BREAKING:]

    He's such a fountainhead of brute strength, that Ox can destroy sections
    of walls that have already been infirmed. This is used a few times in the
    course of the game, but it also helps to get treasures in isolated rooms.

 MOGU
 ¯¯¯¯
    A mole in the village of Gramor, he was put into a deep coma by Mote. The
    party helps him find his "courage" in the dream world and he joins them in
    their quest, partially as thanks and to get back the rest of the town's
    enslaved mole-people.

   [SKILLS:]

    Lv. ---- Dig ---> Escape from battle

   [DIGGING]

    Digging is a mole's specialty, so obviously a mole-person retains that
    tip-top technique. On the world map, Mogu can dig into the dragon marks
    and uncover the areas below, which may have treasure or people. He also
    can use this ability to dig up items on the world map, a skill employed
    once in the lategame (see: Root).

 Name your character if you want (default: Zack) and adjust your settings. As
 the game begins, Zack will be in a burning house, awoken by an old hag. Open
 the burning bureau nearby to get a [V. PTN] (you won't be able to get it
 later) and follow the guide downstairs.

 The villagers have gathered, now. Talking to the people by the entrance makes
 them step aside, and once Zack talks to the middle woman, more townspeople
 rush in and say the Dark Dragons are attacking the village.

 After some scenes, the old man makes a [300 GP] chest appear nearby. Rob it
 of its bounty and exit the building. The only other building contains the
 dragon save point. You can heal for free at the old woman in the main house,
 too. Get out of town when you're ready to do some cuttin'.

 'Kay, you can battle weak Slimes around these parts, all of which you can
 fell in a single hit. They drop Antidotes, too. Bullas take two hits to drop,
 however. When your health gets low, don't waste items; go back into town and
 heal up. Beware, because Bullas can appear in twos. I suggest kickin' monster
 behind until you're around Level 4. 

 Don't bother with buying any new swords/armors, as you'll get an upgrade in
 the very near future. After healing up, make your way north of...

 Yeah, kinda backwards. Anyway, there's a major monster infestation in the

    |___________________|  If you took the previous advice and didn't buy any
                           equipment upgrades, you might have to hotfoot it
 through the serpentine passage and camp out at the healing water spots to get
 a few levels. But, as soon as you get to the end of the (one-track) hallway,
 you can get the BronzSW (@5) which will be of great aid. The rest of the
 corridors are self-explanitory, too, with treasure chests along the way. If
 you see a passage, take it -- there isn't any secret items lying in wait at
 any dead ends.

 Make sure to equip the Visor/Gauntlet/BronzSW as soon as you get them, which
 should let you plow through most enemies now. One chest (@6) is a trap, but
 heals your HP/MP since there is a boss fight coming up. The other chest in
 the west (@7) is an Antidote trap, letting you get the item in exchange for
 some AP. Get chest 7 before 6 if you want all the items.

 The stairway nearby leads up to the boss.

 | BOSS: Frog | HP: ~100 | EP: 500 | GP: 350 | ITEM: None |
 o------------o----------o---------o---------o------------o

  Zack should be hitting for 19 dmg or thereabouts, so this shouldn't take too
  long if you're about level five or six. Frog hits for 7~9 or so damage but
  is also faster than you (unless you're a high level), so if you need to heal
  it'll have to be done a turn before you actually need to do it -- anticipate
  the enemy and all that. 'Sides the speedy Frog's legs (:p), it's just hack-
  -and-slash, through and through. When you deplete its HP, it "seems alright"
  enough to take one more hit to go down. Such fortitude...

  ---

  Take the two chests nearby (Herb/150 GP) and start chuggin' back towards the
  castle entrance. Yes, you have to walk back. Luckily, the experience from
  the amphibian you just murdered should've pushed you up a level or two; and,
  there aren't enemies anyway.

  As you come out of the castle victorious, the king says that the Dark Dragon
  family must have control of...uh, the Quake Control. The secret palace in
  Nanai should be a conduit to stop 'em. Sorry, no lavish reward for the hero.
  Exit back onto the world map, aiming north again...

  By the way, you can buy an ArmPad (better than SuedeCP) if you want, but
  you'll get a free one comin' up. Having about ten herbs is a good idea for
  the upcoming boss, though.

 Get northbound up the peninsula and you'll eventually loop around by Nanai,
 which is clogging up the only passage east. You can only enter it completely
 in the nighttime.

 Evidently drunk from the night's pillaging, the Dark Dragons are either on
 the ground in "passed-out" mode or wary to your presence. You can still
 sneak around town, luckily; getting caught just means you're ejected from
 town. Go into the inn and search a bureau for a sweet [S. PTN], then leave
 again.

 Head around the inn to the north and go east, sticking as far south from the
 vigilant vigilante as you can. When you get to the water pool, head north
 and enter the unguarded house. There's two doses of [150 GP] inside. Exit
 again.

 'Kay, this time go south from the west edge of the pond and you should be
 just out of view of the item shop guard and the other faux-ninja in the
 east. From there, you can continue to the structure the pond surrounds or
 sneak to the eastern edge and enter the weapon shop. Nothing of interest
 except for the LongSD (2250g), which you can't probably buy. You can also
 enter the northeasternmost house by cutting along the east side of the pond
 and heading east along the north edge of town. There's two [HERB] chests to
 be found.

 Anywho...when you're ready to continue, enter the palace, unlock the gate,
 and head into the subterranean caves...

 Some of the chests are skippable, but the F.Stn./B.Stn. battle items, as well
 as the Cure, are definitely worth the detour (the formers are useful in the
 upcoming boss fight). As before, this is a one-time-only dungeon, so if you
 are a huge perfectionist, hit up all the loot in the caves.

 The second large area sends you right to a fancy room; the boss is near the
 adjoining control altar.

 | BOSS: Knight | HP: ~200 | EP: 700 | GP: 500 | ITEM: None |
 o--------------o----------o---------o---------o------------o

  Use the F. Stn. and B. Stn. items and you'll really put a dent in this guy's
  health. By level eight, Zack should have the upper hand in speed, so you can
  act without thinking ahead. That said, Knight uses T.Bolt to do 20 damage to
  you, so use Herbs to rectify the situation. Luckily, T. Bolt isn't a crutch
  the boss uses too much; physical attacks are more likely to come your way.
  When his HP lowers too far, he uses "Recover!" to gain 40 health back. When
  its health is exhausted, the Knight manages to yell and stay in the fight
  for about about 100 more damage (!). It takes three near-fatal encounters for
  ol' rustbucket to give up the ghost.

 Once you can move again, inspect the machine for the [E. KEY] and leave via
 the teleportation device. You'll escape just in time to see Nanai meet a nice
 earthquakey explosion. You end up back at...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 Nothing to do but listen to the nerdy vassal (Scribe Shanky from Musashi? XD)
 talk about going to Winlan. Go back to where Nanai once stood and head east.
 If you're finding the enemies annoying, remember that you can use the E. Key
 in battle -- it does 30 damage to all enemies...and it's reusable!

 Anyway, the path east of Nanai's ruins leads north eventually. Ignore the
 cave you see and head into windmill central...

 There's an inn here, although if you want to know a fun fact, you can eat the
 fish on the kitchen counter and in some houses to refill HP -- hey, if it
 saves you the cash, right? Other things of notice are you can buy Acorns at
 the item shop (refill AP) and use the storage facility, which houses your
 items/coins for use later on. Can't store the E. Key, though.

 In the the eastern house on the main horizontal street, you can search a
 bureau for a [V. PTN]. Yum. Go into the castle and talk to the white-robed
 woman to cue some scenes; once they've concluded, you'll control Nina, the
 princess. Go down the nearby stairs to arrive back on the ground floor.

 Take the two [HERB] chests nearby and the four chests in the northwestern
 corner of the level. There are two chests in the floor below, too. Talk to
 Zack to see him mumble something about a girl in his sleep...kekekeke!

 Exit Winlan and go to the cave nearby.

 News around here is that the dead have been turned into zombies by a wizard's
 dubious potion. Everything seems normal during the daytime, so get the inn's
 [L. PTN] and the northeasternmost house's [PROTNB] -- both in bureaus, of
 course. In a house directly east of the item shop, there is a hole in the
 floor. Drop down into it to find some people living under the floorboards.

 An NPC complains that the map is missing. To find it, go over to the jars.
 Push (the only possible) one east, then push one north. It seems like Nina
 can't push any others, but if you try to push one west, you'll see it go off
 the screen -- a miracle of 3D. Push the water barrel away and 'inspect' where
 it was placed to find a [MAP].

 Exit Romero through the western gate to be on the world map again. If you

 the E. Key you have. In fact, it's highly recommended, as you can pretty much
 get through the entire forest without taking any damage (if you're lucky).

 On the first floor are two healing fountains, so if you want to camp out and
 raise levels, there's the place to do it. Go down the stairway north of the
 entrance to the tower and find the two [HERB] chests.

 Near the east fountain on 1F is a scythe-wielding creature. Talk to it and...

  This should be a pushover no matter what you do. Use the E. Key and have the
  soldiers attack. It should be dead in three turns, since he starts crying as
  his HP depletes, giving him one last stand. Chances are he'll act first
  in this battle, so plan your healing strategies accordingly.

  Okay, given the complexity of the stairs around here, I'll do a step-by-step
  way to do this.

  01) Take "E" to the second floor.
  02) Take "K" to the third floor.
  03) Arc east and take "L" down to second floor.
  04) Take "D" upstairs, avoiding the floor holes.
  05) There will be four floor holes, as so:

               [] []
               [] []

      Take the NE on in the arrangement, ending up at first floor.

  06) Avoid hole and take stairway "F" to second floor.
  07) Take "G" up to third floor.

  Here, you can find another scythe-wielder blocking your way.

  Again, use the E. Key to take down this boss. Same as the Morte fight, 'cept
  she has about 1.5x more health. She can pack a punch, too, dealing about 20
  damage or thereabouts. You'll probably have to have someone healing every
  other round. Like before, Mortea will seem "alright" when her HP's been 
  crunched, but ~30 damage should take her down for good.

  When you're done, take the stairway she blocked up to the top of the tower,
  heading west across the bridge. Once you get to the second tower, you'll
  find the kidnapped Romano girls and two stairways. Take the one by the gate
  to find some healing fountains and a dragon lord statue.

  Open the switch inside the gate you just passed to make the girls move out
  of your way, letting you head downstairs. Take the [CURE] you see and keep
  on going.

  ---

  Eventually, you'll find the Wizard in a dimly-lit room who throws Xeon Gas
  on you -- that stuff prevents your powers from working. The guy even has the
  audacity to call everyone a "bird"! Grr...

  Anyway, you fight the wizard twice, each time with you forced to lose. One
  of the soldiers will fly off to get help...

 The wounded soldier tells of the princess' fate before dying. Zack is asked
 to rescue everyone, and can't refuse. Go into town, buy any supplies you'll
 think you need (Herbs/ChainML!), and exit onto the world map. Talk to the
 Winlan soldier and he gives you a ride back to...

 You'll land on the roof of the second tower. Head down, save if you want (not
 recommended if you're unsure of your strength), and return to the wizard's
 chambers. The accompanying soldier can't go down with you, and leaves the
 party.

 In the subterranean, gassed-up area, follow to the leftern side of the area
 and get the long-range [FOIL] weapon (and also refill HP/AP). Equip it on
 Zack if you want and head toward the north/south passage in the middle of the
 area. The wizard bemoans your presence and attacks! Wowee! Zowee!

  Use the B. Stn. and C. Stn. items immediately and you can deplete all of his
  HP. Of course, he puffs out his chest and can weather a little more damage,
  but that's what the E. Key is for. Just use that for your major source of
  attack if you don't have the above items, and use Herbs when it slings its
  magic at you. T. Bolt and Blizzard can do around ~20, so if you have to use
  item healing, it'll be attack, heal, attack, heal, etc.

  Following battle, the Wizard dies and you get the [REMEDY]. Afterwards, its
  another flight back to...

 Go to the second floor and see speak with Nina at the king's bedside. His
 Majesty appears to be in critical condition...until he jumps around the bed
 like a kook. Nina will join the party permanently now and you can leave via
 the tunnel.

 So...uh, where is it? On the first floor, take the stairway into the basement
 and talk to the two green guards preventing passage beyond. They'll step
 aside and you can cross the bridge. Follow the dirt path until it ends near
 the seaside, then continue east to the town rubbing shoulders with the dry
 riverbed...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| 17) Tantar/Tuntar                                                    [TNT1] |

o--------------------------------------o

 Word around these parts is that the Dark Dragons have dammed the river mouth
 and the agricultural communities are suffering. Zack and Nina'll have to be
 doing somethin' about that, won't they? Before you get your hands dirty, dig
 around the inn and chieftain's houses for the bureau items, a [CHARM] and
 [L. PTN], respectively.

 Once the looting is done, go into the foundry in the southern part of town
 and find the blacksmith. Give him the I. Ore you found in Aura Cave (if you
 don't have it, go back and get it) and he'll turn it into a [SAW]. You can
 leave now.

 Oh, and if you go to Tuntar on the other riverbank, you can find the item
 shop and an [HERB] bureau in the chieftain's house; the inn has a [CURE]
 bureau in the back. The town here also speaks of a...stone robot... Hmm...

| ENEMY: Creep, Gloom, WarHog, Stool, Zombie, Blurb |
'---------------------------------------------------'

 Just a note for milking enemies out here. Using the Foil + E. Key really can
 clean up enemies around here, the WarHogs in particular -- they leave loads
 of EXP/GP to finance your equipment expenditures. M. Drops are on sale in
 Tuntar, if you want some.

 To continue with the story, go northwest of Tantar until you find a slope to
 advance north. You'll come to a grove of trees blocked by a large tree, and
 if you have the Saw in your inventory, you'll cut it down. The boughs of the
 woods shake as you enter...

o--------------------------------------o

 Small area, so there's no map. Make note that the S. Rider enemies will be
 faster than you and can hit for 10+ damage, so even with a Foil/E.Key combo
 you may end up killed. Keep your HP above 25 at all times while here, or at
 least until you're faster than them.

 The duo starts in the south. Travel north and you should see a chest in the
 NW -- [HERB]. Get it and continue north along the western screen boundary,
 coming to a [T. DROP] chest. From there head back south, taking the first
 eastern path.

 Now, the destination is in the upper right-hand corner of the woods, but you
 can get a few other chests -- [WRIST], [LIFE], [T. DROP] -- by exploring the
 eastern expanses. One is along the northern edge of the wall, and the others
 can be found by going south from there, then west along the southern screen
 boundary.

 When you want to continue, head into the northeastern part of the woods and
 enter the weird-shaped bunker...

  Basically just use the E. Key and Foil; don't even have to use Atk-Up or
  anything. Should only take two turns to murder these faces, or one if you
  are decently leveled.

  Once the doofuses are dead, walk under the doorway where the bats are and
  you will fall into a basement with four chests: two [LIFE]s, [LONGSD] &
  [T. DROP]. Use the stairs nearby to exit.

  Now, head up the path along the eastern wall (straightforward) until it
  splits north and south. Take the north (south is a trap) and you will come
  upon another set of tweedle-dee/tweedle-dums.

 o--------o---------o---------o---------o
 | Lancer | HP: ~80 |
 o--------o---------o

  Same strat as last time: use E. Key and Foil. Shouldn't take more than two
  turns this way, and even yet, the enemies just use basic attacks. Laff.

  With the duo dead, arc south to the four chests: [HERB], [T. DROP], [ACORN],
  and [LIFE2]. Use the down-stairway in the northwest, coming into floor B1
  (as I call it). 

  Continue east and take the short north passage, which sends you plummeting
  into a treasure room. Heal up before you take the items, because the SE
  chest deals 50 damage to the party leader (note: can't KO). The [WOLFHT],
  [T. DROP], and two [HERB]s are your reward. Take the tiny stairs back up
  and take the long path near another [HERB] chest -- there's a similar
  chest in the very SW of the room.

  In the north, there are three Dark Dragons guarding the kidnapped chief.
  Yipes! Come into battle healed before you engage 'em.

  There are two Lancers and a Bowman this time around. Use Atk-Up if you need
  to, but the Foil/E. Key strategy can clear the Lancers in the first round
  with a good probability. They're a bit more powerful than normal, and since
  there are three, they can swamp a character and kill him/her off if you're
  unlucky. But, besides that small likelihood, this should be gravy. Try to
  end the battle fully-healed, since your HP carries over to the next.

  When the chief is returned, he asks if you want him to lead you to the Dark
  Dragons. Giving an affirmative answer will cue a fight with Pog, although
  by repeatedly refusing to tag along, the Pog fight can be skipped entirely
  (and go right to the one after, the General)!

  What a goofus! This Schizo-wannabe (see: FF7) isn't up to snuff, and can
  only play off your lack of recovery from the previous fight. Cure yourselves
  up if you're in critical condition (attacks can do ~20 dmg) and give Atk-Up
  to Zack, who can wail on the enemy, hopefully for ~50 damage. Use Fort for
  good effect, too, if you have T. Drops to heal the AP with. There really
  should not be any trouble here if you can recover your health. As per usual,
  you have to deal extra damage at the fight's end to really kill the boss, 
  but it's only 30~40, easily dealt with the E. Key. Make sure to heal up 
  before this fight ends, because you will be fighing ANOTHER boss very, very
  soon.

  A wolven stranger saves your hide and the fake chief reveals himself as the
  Dark Dragon General!

  I would say that you should give Fort to Bo, but the General is a complete
  PUSHOVER. Make no mistake: the General is pretty powerful, dealing 20 or so
  to Zack/Nina and 30ish to Bo...but he just doesn't have enough HP to sustain
  any sort of offense. Have Zack attack, Nina use the E. Key and heal if she
  has to, and Bo use a Lv2 spell of his (or cure), and this should be over in
  two rounds.

  Afterwards, the chief leaves to look for a way to stop the rock that's been
  used as a stopper for the river, and Bo joins the party permanently. Equip
  him with the WolfHT, of course. You can leave the fort, now, and also the
  woods. Nothin' else to do here.

  In Tuntar, the newly-released chief says that the secret of the giant robot
  in the north is found in Agua. Since there aren't any ways to go near the
  twin cities, it's time to revisit Romero. If you position Bo in the party
  leader position (L/R shoulder buttons), you can walk through forests and
  use the shortcut to...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 Buy ChainML for Bo and a Sown for Nina if you haven't already!

 Anywho, after you've talked to Tuntar's chief about Agua (YOU MUST DO THIS),
 zombies will start appearing in Romero during the night. Enter the town 
 during the day and talk to the wild-haired old man in the northeasternmost
 house. The geezer says he'll give you information on Agua if you eradicate
 the town's zombies.

 Walk around the world map until it's night and re-enter. The old woman in the
 graveyard doesn't say anything else to you until you've talked to the female
 NPC (in old man's NE house, 2F) about Cleansing Water. After that, the hag's
 zombie hubby reveals a secret tombstone passage, saying that the cave in the
 west has the Cleansing Water. Enter the newly-opened hole and take the [HERB]
 and [WTRJR]. Exit town and remember to upgrade equipment!

 you will need to get into Agua Tower. The zombies have been laid to rest,
 but who will bring back the slain piggies? =(

 Upgrade your equips if you haven't already and exit back onto the world map.
 With Bo in the lead, head towards the floating tower by the northwest pond.

 o------------o----------o----------o---------o

  You're gypped out of a good fight here. Wisp will either attack someone for
  mediocore damage (~15) or does mediocre damage to everyone (~10). Use normal
  attacks, the Earth Key, and Bo's spells (Fry, in particular) to defeat it.
  Conserve the B/C Stn.s you may have, but feel free to use Atk-Up/Fort. No
  last bit of strength before it dies, either!

 Search the pillar after Wisp's gone to get the [KNGKEY]. It doesn't unlock
 any of the gates you encountered previously, but it does operate the gigantic
 robot north of Tuntar.

 Allen Wong writes: There was an item I came across that wasn't in your guide
 and was found in Agua Tower on the top level where you get the key from the
 Wisp.  It is in a corner hidden inside the fourth of the four pillar
 indentations on the right where there is a hidden spot with a SteelBW that I
 accidentally came across.  You have to walk into the wall to get to that
 invisible chest.  Thought you'd like to add that you your items. (Thanks!)

 Nina's Warp spell doesn't work here, so you'll have to put on some walkin'
 shoes and make the descent. Warp to Tantar once you're done and get back on
 the map.

 To find the monolithic robot, head north of Tuntar and go up the first slope
 you see by the road. It leads to a cave, but instead of entering it, go east
 and follow the mountain range north. At the very northern spot, continue up
 the plain until you see a cliff quarry to the east. The robot is there, and
 you have to enter from its left leg.

 After Agua Tower, you're treated with an easily navigable letter. Once out
 of the stairwells, go east until you find the two chests, [BRONZHT] and an
 [HERB], in an antechamber. Exit east to the next floor.

 Here you'll find three goofy Dark Dragon soldiers around a big...uh, heart.
 They want to rip your face off, of course.

  This should be a no-brainer, what with three incredibly weak idiots putting
  up their dukes. Use the E. Key and Foil to take out the Lancers in the first
  round, then slap the General around in the next (and last) round. General'll
  yell himself a second chance when his HP's depleted, but you know how to
  deal with people who can't use their inside voice. ^___^

 Once the goonies are dead, use the key on the heart's panel. To get all the
 chests when the teleport pads are on, here's what you do (from heart's room:)

 01) Take pad nearest room stairway
 02) Take pad at the twisting dead end
 03) Take pad against western wall ----------> [ACORN]

 Now, get back to step three:

 04) Take the other pad here.
 05) Take pad in the tiny dead-end nearby ---> [LIFE2] + [MRLB1]

 Get back to step five's location:

 06) Take the other pad in the room
 07) Take the next pad...

 ...and you should be in the heart of the giant. Use the Key here and Nina'll
 command it to take her to the lake. It'll destroy the rock with a laser beam
 and you can leave the thing entirely. The stairway exit is thattaway.

 Talk to the chief in the pondside house and he'll suggest finding the forest
 clan's sacred Ring. He pushes his chair aside, and if you enter the hole
 beneath, you find an [HERB] and the cave's [KEY]. Go to the house's second
 floor and open the bureau for an [W. PTN] also.

 Once you've healed/saved and have gotten back on the world map, head to the
 cave near the robot.

 Another fairly easy map, it's a wonder the Dark Dragon's haven't pillaged
 the shrine already. Head north across the wood bridge and veer west, taking
 the [W. PTN.] nearby. Exit out the other side and you'll be back on the world
 map; take the other cave entrance nearby.

 Unlock the gate with the key and venture downstairs. It's a straightforward
 walk until you get to a waterfall room. Enter the shallows and jump down the
 falls to the south, landing at the foot of the place.

 Continue south and get the [LIFE] chest, and if you arc west via the nearby
 stair, you can come to another waterlogged platform with a [LIFE2] chest.
 You might as well go this way because the northeastern down-stairway leads
 to a circular dead-end. So, take the down-stairway in the west.

 As you come to the top of the falls, head north along the west wall to get
 a [2000 GP] chest. Enter the shallows and stick to the middle, climbing the
 platform in the north to get a [HERB]. Finally, break land along the eastern
 wall and continue all the way south, to find an [ACORN] chest nearby. Proceed
 to get back in the water and jump the falls again.

 At the bottom of the falls, climb the layered land platform nearby and reap
 the [SKYSH] item (give to Nina). Trek east to the blue-chest platform, which
 turns out to house the legendary [RING] item. Taking it sets off the teleport
 device nearby and you can make an easy exit. Warp to Tantar and save before
 you do anything else.

 Oh, and you can equip the Ring as an accessory [Attack +10]!

 Enter the chief's house and talk to the Tuntar chief to begin the marriage
 ceremony. Afterwards, heal at the inn and leave town. You'll see the next

 Refer to previous section on The Giant -- TGT1 -- for item locations.

 'Kay, now you have to make it back to the brain of this behemoth. To do so,
 take the following warps (starting at first room with a warp, natch):

 01) In heart room, warp nearest the stair
 02) Warp farthest from pad you just took
 03) Go north. Take NE warp.
 04) Take warp in the room with two pillars
 05) North to warp

 | BOSS: Gremlin | HP: ~1100 | EP: 1400 | GP: 800 |
 o---------------o-----------o----------o---------o

  Hardest battle up to this point, definitely.

  Immediately start casting Fort with Nina, on Bo, herself, then Zack -- the
  boss has an attack that hits everyone. He also has a weakish attack (~25dmg)
  that is dealt to a single target. Healing is more of a priority here, but as
  long as you can use Fort on everyone, the battle should be tolerable. Bo
  should be a healer or use Fry (T. Bolt clone) which does lots of damage; Zak
  can use the E. Key for an easy thirty damage. Gremlin rarely uses the multi-
  -hit skill twice in a row, so the party should get a healing turn in every
  time. When its HP is depleted, you'll have to inflict an additional 175-ish
  damage before it drops. Remember, if you're really in a bind, use an M. Drop
  or Meat (have Bo kill a boar on world map) -- both are great pick-me-ups if
  the damage is too much for you. Bo's spells come in very handy, and are the
  best method of attack actually, so you may want to have Zack pull item heal
  duties.

 After Gremlin's toast, so is the robot -- it falls to the volcano. It even
 says "good-bye" to the party (v_v) as it destroys itself. Luckily, the lava
 flow from the eruption hardens in the riverbed and you can now continue 
 south.

 headed next, and it's right nearby, thankfully. Buy some Herbs back in town
 if you have little or none.

o--------------------------------------o

 Put Zack in the lead here.

 Talk to the priest guy and he'll let Zack continue alone (i.e. party members
 do not fight with him). Heal at the pure-water fountain and take the [MELON]
 chest on the right side of the room. Talk to the Dragon Lord apparition to
 begin a boss battle.

 o-------------o----------o---------o---------o
 | BOSS: Talon | HP: ~500 | EP: 400 | GP: 190 |
 o-------------o----------o---------o---------o

  This is just a back-and-forth battle, with one person taking a shot before
  the next guy takes his. Talon relies on basic attacks (~15dmg), so heal if
  your HP drops below twenty -- he can inflict critical "Slam" hits, too, and
  is faster than you. Zack seems to pull of Cntr attacks a bit easier when he
  is all by his lonesome, though. The boss doesn't pull any sort of tricks at
  the end, either -- he just dies. Using the E. Key expedites this process.

 After battle, Zack is bestowed powers to save the world. He'll now have the
 SnoDr, FlmDr, and ThrDr elemental spells. Heal up and leave to the world
 map.

 There's a little part of sidequest you can initiate now. Use Bo to walk in
 the forest and find the flowered clearing. Talk to a fairy who asks if you're
 there to cut down trees. Leave and go west from the forest to another flower
 circle. A man will be stuck there, saying a strange force is keeping him
 there. That's all.

 Southwest of the forest is a cave entrance, and that's where yer going.

 Very straighforward for the most part, follow the tunnel until there's a path
 split -- one west, one south. The western one's blocked for now, so continue
 south to exit. Beware the Shadow enemies here who usually appear in twos and
 threes, because they like to throw Curse/Paralyze around.

 On the world map, head southeast and south alone the waterside hill to find
 the town of...

 The town guards show their hospitality by immediately kicking your behind in
 jail under the pretense of "intruding." In jail, talk to the sleeping man and
 he will open the locked gate for you. Yes, the incarcerated man can open the
 cell... =/  Check the water fountain in the corner for some [PRISNCL] wear.
 You can leave the station after that.

 Guards around town will throw you in jail if they see you, but you can still
 enter the inn, dragon-lord save shrine, weapon shops, and some residential
 houses. Enter the weapon shops (next to jailhouse) and go to the 2nd floor.
 Push the dresser on the north wall aside and enter the secret room beyond it.
 Shove the pot aside and take the [LIFE2] underneath.

 Back in the second-floor barroom, a man has the hiccups. Go downstairs and
 buy one vitamin (650g) and he'll reward you with [5000 GP] for the kindness.
 Why he didn't buy 'em himself is beyond me. Anyway, time to play Robin Hood
 with all the greedy homeowners.

 Behind the police station are some mansions with rosary emblems on 'em. The
 one right behind the station has a [LIFE] chest and an [S. PTN] in the
 bureau near there. Upstairs, rob the bureau of a [CURE] and the chest of a
 [W. ANT]. The sleeping "shooop!" guy doesn't even know he's being burgled.
 Exit the manse and head to the one east of there.

 The first floor has a [LIFE] chest and a [V. PTN] bureau. Upstairs, take
 the [2000 GP] bureau and the [MRBL1] chest. Exit the residence and go to the
 one right behind it.

 Don't open the first-floor chest here -- it's rigged to alarm! The bureau
 beside it still gives up a [L. PTN]. Upstairs, raid the [MRLB3] bureau and
 the [CURE] chest. Talk to the old man as Nina (he requests it...) and help
 fix his aching back -- you get [20000 GP]! Go to the last mansion, now.

 The first floor has an [ACORN] chest and a [SMARTRG] chest. Equip it on your
 main healer/magic-user. Take the stairs up to the [LIFE] and [ANTDT] finds,
 bureau and chest, respectively. The woman here is actually the mother of the
 guy who was trapped in the fairy circle by the dragon shrine. If you talked
 to him before, she'll want you to help rescue him (warp to Tantar, talk to
 fairy in forest, talk to fairy at circle, return to Auria). When you do, you
 get [20000 GP] for the trouble.

 Head into the northernmost mansion now. Go up to the second floor and raid
 the [CURE] and [G. TIARA] chests. There's also a [2000 GP] stash in the NE
 bureau. The man on the ground floor (Ross) is in a bit of pickle, but he
 won't tell you anything unless you agree to help him. To get him to do that,
 talk to the man at the wharf, left of the weapon/item shop.

 Once you've struck a bargain to help (in exchange for use of his ship), he'll
 say his daughter is stuck in the safe. Sadly, you can't do anything about it
 now. You'll have to progress with the storyline, and that requires you to buy 
 a "G. Bar" -- 65,000 gold. Since there isn't a storage shop, just sell all of
 the junk you have and make sure to get the easy 40,000g stated above. Kill
 enemies, whatever...just make some cash. The G. Tiara sucks, by the way, but
 sells for 10,000g. Buy a Pouch item, too -- it helps in the next town.

 Once the gold bar's in your possession, exit onto the world map and steer
 east. The cave's nearby.

 Talk to the two men here who warn of Bleak's thieves. Enter the stairwell
 and enter the maze. Ordinarily, this would be a little annoying, but since
 there is only one straightforward way with a few dead ends around, it's very
 simple. When you finally get to the eastern wall, take the first left path
 to a [SHELLHT] and [CURE] chest duo. Continue south along the eastern wall
 to find an up-stairway.

 From here, go east. When you get to the north/south split, you can leave at
 once to the world map (south), but if you meander north along the path, you
 can come back to the first room where the two guys were, and be able to 
 unlock the gate for easier passage. Whatever you want to do, I guess.

 Don't forget about the locked gates here...

 Ahh, the joys of thievery. You can stay at the inn for free, but the owner'll
 steal 200GP from you if you do...that is, unless you have a Pouch in your
 inventory. Take a nap with the Pouch in your inventory to catch the owner
 red-handed, and he'll give you [5000 GP] to keep quiet.

 Anyway, there's still thieving from the thieves that can be done. Don't buy
 into the "fortune teller" -- she'll just dump you in a house and take your
 cash. However, in that very same house (the one she stands by) is a barrel
 that covers a [LIFE2]. Later on, you can get a powerful item behind the
 heavy box, too.

 In the NW house behind the shops is a fakey magician. Upstairs in his house
 is a set of [HERB] (x2) chests. If you want to see Chun Li of Street Fighter
 fame in a cameo, talk to the magician. Answer "yes" twice, "no" twice, then
 "yes." Kinda funny.

 Anyway, go to the northern house and talk to the old man. He says Karn can
 help you open the safe in Auria but he's in the Krypt currently. If you have
 the G. Bar, you can trade it for an Icicle to travel in the desert. Unlike
 the other offers, this one's legit -- you can't refuse anyway. He also says
 there are lots of traps where Karn is... Take the [LIFE] and [W. ANT] pair
 of chests upstairs -- and the 2 [HERB]s in the magician's next-door house --
 and leave town.

 Upgrade your equipment, too! Then, exit town and head west to the visible...

 Nothing really here, although there's an (unmarked) inn NE of where you come
 in, and you can stay for free (save point is here, too). Nothing else of
 interest here, so enter the orange tent in the north. The mayor says he'll
 give you the fife if you destroy the Sand Worm. Agree, and it will become
 night.

 Go to the goat pen beside the orange tent and the boss fight will cue up
 automatically.

 o-----------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Not hard at all. Have Zack turn into the Thunder Dragon while Nina uses Fort
  on Bo a few times. Sand Worm only has a single-target attack, which can do
  50+ to our weak friend Bo, but is prefectly tolerable on everyone else. Nina
  can deal out cures while Bo attacks (if you have LongBo) and uses Fry. This
  guy's no Gremlin, that's for sure.

 Afterwards, take the [FIFE] from the chest in the mayor's house. Heal up and
 leave town. Down at the sandswirlin' moat, walk onto the cement tile and
 press the "A" button to make a bridge appear. Enter.

 Another mostly simple area. From where you enter, take the snaking path
 along the east wall to the exit: a down-stairway. You'll enter a room that
 looks like this:

 _______________________________________

                                           that drop you into a spacious hole.
 To find the exit there without much lame fighting, head due north, then head
 due east (appear in same room by #4 platform).

 Exiting this room brings you down (eventually) to a large, similar-type one.
 The chest you find at the northern platform has [HEADGEAR] but opening it
 KILLS a character -- make sure you have a Life on-hand. The platform to the
 left with the B. Rang can't be tangled with, for now anyway. Keep going
 north and try to get past the eyeless monster on the stairway platform...

 o--------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Zack should transform into the thunder dragon and attack, Nina's the healer
  and stat-buffer (Fort -> Bo), and Bo can use Fry and be the second healer if
  you need to. Which you won't, because EyeSpy is pretty unconvincing as boss
  material for the most part. When its eyes have been put out, it starts to
  use T. Bolt on everyone (flat 25dmg). Bo can be a healer while Zack wrecks
  EyeSpy's face, too -- just remember to give him an Acorn when he needs it.
  Be happy, because for once, Bo is taking equal damage to his companions. :p

 Head upstairs afterwards and find a gaggle of treasure chests: [ICYHT],
 [CURE], two [SKULLHT]s, and an [ANTDT]. Open the blue chest to trigger a
 drowning trap...but Karn saves you! When Karn goes below, do the same and
 talk to him -- he'll join the party. His special ability is lockpickin' on
 caliber with Jill Valentine (:p). He also disarms traps, so use him anytime
 you think a trap's about.

 After the first two locked doors, you'll come to a third farther north. Go
 west to find two chests -- [CURE] and [HERB] -- with traps in 'em. Retreat
 back to the gate you passed, lockpick it, and go downstairs again.

 Take the first southern exit you see to a [HUNTCL] chest, then backtrack to
 the large stairway in the middle of the room. Follow it down to a vast room
 with caskets in it. Search all eight chests and you'll discover that the
 book Karn's looking for...is the casket itself! You can leave the area now,
 although you'll have to walk out. Hope you have some Mrlb3s to spare. =)

 Now that you can unlock vault doors and all, you may consider going back to
 L & D Cave and a few other places, particularly Agua. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU
 DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The destination is still Auria, though.

 Entering from the Auria side, unlock the first door just to do so and return
 west, taking the northern path along until you can get to a locked vault. 
 Pry it open with Karn and get the [DART] chest. Continue south along the
 east wall until you get back to the first vault door you unlocked. Take the
 nearby stairway and head east. Remember how you can get back to the initial
 room (from Auria) with the gate switch? Head north and come to another gate
 to open and this time it's a...[G. BAR]! To Auria!

 NOTE: You will actually need another G. Bar soon. This is still optional, but
       it's kinda dumb to gather another 65,000g when you can get the item in
       ten seconds.

 Unlock the doors until you get up to the boss floor. Go left until you find
 another locked door and, beyond it, a movement pad. Use it to go south and
 you'll be able to walk out in the fresh air for a brief moment before coming
 back inside.

 The first chest is a [LAVASH], which is +36 defense at this point in time!
 Keep climbing until you come to a watery shrine. Search the left draconic
 statue for the mindblowingly strong [LIFEAR] armor, for Zack only. The right
 statue has an [ICYDR] dirk for Karn. You can leave now.

 The guards will arrest you again if you're spotted, and if so, you won't be
 able rely on the guy from before...because it seems Karn was incarcerated at
 last jailing! Anyway, just a tidbit. Also, Karn can't disarm that trap chest
 in the NE mansion...what gives? =/

 So, go into Ross' mansion and unlock the two vault doors in the basement
 underground. The daughter says her father was planning on giving the LtKey
 to the Dark Dragons and how her mother wouldn't have set him straight... Hmm,

 Right off the bat, lockpick your way into the ground-floor room and take the
 [2000 GP] chest, then the stairs up. There's an old man here who says he'll
 give you his treasure if you defeat the monsters. Climb the stairs nearby to
 get on the third floor.

 There are two stairways here. Take the left one first to a [B. STN.] and
 [LIFE] chest duo. Double-back and take the left stairway. Now on the fourth
 floor, take the other stairway just south of where you come in.

 Floor #5. Take the stairway in front of you to get to a [LIFE2] chest, then
 take the down-stairway in the west to another room with [HERB], [HORNHT], and
 [CURE]. Double-back two rooms until you're at the other part of Floor #5; go
 south around the corner and head north along the east wall to the sixth-floor
 exit.

 Two more stairways here. As you arc counterclockwise, take the last (2nd)
 stairway you see. You'll eventually arrive on the eighth floor with [TURBAN]
 and [2000 GP] chests. Return to the sixth floor and take the stairway you
 ignored. This leads up to the seventh floor, and if you take the stairwell
 placed right near the entrance, it leads up to the top floor. Inspect the
 glowing red-orb stand and...

  Yeah, this guy can really wallop. Burn Out can do 30-40 damage and T. Bolt 
  does 40 damage (consistant). Luckily, those are only single-target attacks
  and easily overcome. Have Zack become a thunder dragon, Nina heal Cura1/2,
  and Bo attack with Karn. Like a few other bosses, he dies immediately when
  his HP is depleted.

 Afterwards, inspect the pillar to get the [DKKEY], NOT usable in battle...
 Return to the old man on the second floor and he'll let you take the [MIRROR]
 chest he's been guarding. You'll now find the world map in constant daylight,
 which is hilarious. Warp to Auria.

 appears and (easily) dissuades him from doing something stupid. It's rather
 funny how his wife says "Peace!" before leaving. :p  Talk to Ross, then go
 and talk to his daughter, who'll ask for the party's help in stopping the
 Dark Dragons. You can't refuse...

 She'll move and you can reap the bounty of your fetch quest: [DART],
 [B. STN.], [METALSH], and five [HERB]s. That's right, a bunch of crap for
 the most part. DIE RICHIES! Once over your initial dismay, start climbing
 the mansion tower steps. Get the [F. STN.] chest en route and claim the
 [LTKEY] at the top of the tower.

 Back in Ross' house, he says you can take anything in his house as payment.

  Once again, the Dark Dragons prove to be complete pushovers. Have Zack turn
  into the thunder dragon, Karn attack or use the E. Key, Nina heal, and Bo
  Fry stuff. The Archer sucks, but the Knight can deal +30 damage to a single
  target with his physical attack. Easily remedied, no? The Knight can use a
  T. Bolt spell (~25dmg) when the Archer is gone, though.

 Afterwards, the disgraced Dragons call for an attack on the ship and sink 'er
 to the bottom. A fish-faced man comes and says their main camp can be reached
 by going around the north peninsula. Fishy Face says he'll trade you some
 gunpowder in exchange for a gold bar. A lop-sided trade to be sure, but you
 have to do it. If you don't have a G. Bar, go back and get the free one in 
 L & D Cave; if you do, exchange it immediately for [GNPWDR].

 A bumbling archer decides to pick a fight with you.

  Everyone can attack and kill him. The'nd.

  Just attack 'em. That's about as simplistic as you can get.

 Afterwards, take the next stairway up and you'll find a nice human opponent.
 ...NOT!

 o-------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  You know the drill. Have Zack transform into thunder dragon, Bo attack and
  use Fry, Karn attack and use the E. Key, while Nina heals everyone and stat-
  -buffs. The monster mostly attacks to a single target, but it can do much
  carnage to people with low defense (in a word: Bo). It did 100+ to Bo when I
  did this. It also has a ink-shooter attack to everyone, that does 20-50 dmg,
  depending on who it hits. As long as you keep Fry+T. Dragon Attack+E. Key+
  Cura2 going it's a fairly bland fight.

 After the squidlarkin's dead, rob the bureau of a [V. PTN] and take the
 stairs down. Take the two [ACORN] and [HERB] chests and leave the ship for
 Auria.

 Of course, nothing ever goes as planned. Dark Dragon maruaders show up and
 demand you give them the key (word travels fast!), to which everyone refuses.
 Go down with the ship...? Well, some people attack you first.

  Change Zack into a thunder dragon, have Bo use Fry, Karn attack and use the
  E. Key, and Nina manage the party upkeep. Like before, the octopus monster
  can use a powerful single-target physical attack (counter: Cure2) and a 
  medium-damage hit-all, for 30~50 damage. Not really different from the romp
  you did on the last boss.

 Gobi helps everyone escape and then uses dynamite to blow everyone up.

 GOBI: "If this doesn't work, don't blame me, OK?"
 EVERYONE: "You're out of your mind!"

 Gobi says you need a "Gills" to reach Prima. He'll sell it for ten million
 gold pieces; you have to choose "Yes," at which time he takes all your cash
 and loans you the rest (rest of what?) You can then control Gobi on the world
 map and sea floor, where he'll be by himself...

 The monsters underwater are powerful, so use any Mrbl1s you have to walk in
 perfect peace. Head west to find the fishy-faces' city of...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 Lots of shops here, but that's to be expected at a merchant town. One shop
 even sells B/C/F. Stn.s, which are always good to have in full supply. Stock
 up however you see fit and talk to the guild owner in the ornate-looking
 house in the north. He says the town has no Gills for sale, but Gant should.
 I don't suggest buying anything here unless you've got a good economy about
 yourself. See the shop list for help here.

 Exit town. To get to Gant, go south from Prima's and break land on the beach
 nearby. Follow the twisting, one-track path to the town in the dead trees...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

o--------------------------------------o

 Head north up the first stairway and enter the house with a square roof. The
 second-floor bureau has an [L. PTN] for you. Continue north to the highest
 building and talk to the bearded man there. He'll say the young men in town
 have been kidnapped (notice the place was deserted?) and he wants you to haul
 some goods back to Prima for him. Accept the offer and take the [GOODS] from
 the chest behind him. There's also a secret entrance behind the dresser, as
 you can probably see, but there's nothing you can do back there...yet.

 Rob the [A. PTN] dresser upstairs before you go back to Prima. You remember
 the way, I hope...

o--------------------------------------o

 Once you have the "Goods," bring them back to the guild leader in the red-
 -colored building in the north. He'll give you the [GILLS] in exchange for
 Gobi's hard work. Somehow, there's also a letter saying Gant's been attacked
 by the Dark Dragons! Just then, a ghost appears upstairs and Gobi says he'll
 get a warrior to defeat it...for 5000 GP. You can decline and raise the cost
 up to 6000 GP, which you should do (takes two 'no's).

 Leave to the world map and go back and get the party members on the island.
 Upgrade your equipment when you get here, now that all allies are present.
 When you return to the Prima inn, talk to the Ghost and...BOOM! Fightin'
 commences.

 o--------------o-----------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Morteo | HP: ~1400 | EP: 3850 | GP: 3609 |
 o--------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Have Gobi use EbbX, Zack change into a thunder dragon and attack, Nina heal
  and stat-buff, and Karn/Bo use E. Key and Fry, respectively (whoever is in
  your party at the time). Gobi is probably the weakest defensively, so change
  him out if he starts taking too much damage. Morteo has a weak physical cut
  attack, which is very easy to stomach unless you're Gobi/Bo (~50-60dmg). But,
  Cura2 is a great band-aid. Morteo "seems alright" when his HP is depleted,
  and that only signifies that battle's around half over -- he's got a lot of
  HP left.

 After Morteo's send packing, the sleeping man nearby wakes up (Ox) and says
 he's one of the metal smiths. Everyone vows to help him (how can he breath
 underwater?) and Ox will join the party. His specialty is breaking stuff with
 a hammer, including walls, and being strong -- you've probably seen a few
 things that can crumble or be pushed, ya?

 Exit to the world map and travel northwest to the beach landing. Or, do the
 following optional things.

 Enter the stairway and have Ox crush the rocks (a-button) and break the wall
 nearby, leading to the [GIANTHR] and [ECHOHT] chests. Go upstairs and take
 the [HERB] chest near the vigilant guard -- he doesn't have to be alerted.
 Now, if you want to proceed with minimal fights:

 01) Break wall near stairway you came through; head north
 02) Break wall directly north; keep heading north
 03) When you get to two breakable walls, head right and get [METALSH]; from
     2 walls, go left for [HERB] -- you have to fight LancerX, though.
 04) At the two walls, break left one and follow path to [LIFE] at dead end
 05) Go back and break the right wall
 06) Go north and take long way around or break wall nearby -- guard may spot
     you on latter if you take direct cut-across.
 07) Follow path to breakable wall, and crunch that sucker
 08) HEAL UP, Fuse Karn into Shin (if applicable) and take stairway down to--

 o------------o-----------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Toad | HP: ~2200 | EP: 6000 | GP: 1500 |
 o------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Karn -> Shin = Win!

  With a name like "Dark Dragon," you'd think they'd transform into something
  menacing... Have Zack transform into a thunder dragon and attack, Nina plays
  stat-buffer and healer, Bo can use Fry/E.Key (if not fused), Karn can use
  Shin, and Ox can crunch and heal (if you want...). Unlike previous battles,
  you can switch out anyone who is a liability and be no worse the wear --
  consider this as you fight. Toad can use a powerful physical attack
  (~70dmg!) that can kill anyone who's health is in poor shape...or Bo who
  took 200+ damage when I was fighting. Luckily, it has no multi-hitting skill
  so Nina can Cura2 the wound away. Consider using Atk-Up on Ox if you've got
  the SpineHR (buy: Gant), which can do almost 100 damage by itself. Bo's weak
  frame aside, this should not prove insurmountable, especially if you got
  Karn's spell in Gant. 

 The prisoners, now released, say that the secret weapon they were forced to
 build was taken north to Nabal. An old man near Gant may be able to give a
 bit of advice on infiltrating the top-notch security location, though... Warp
 to Gant.

 IF YOU DID NOT GET KARN'S SHIN SPELL, GET IT NOW! It's in the secret room in

 Talk to the man in the northernmost house and he'll fix your [B.RANG] if you
 have it, which is better than the Foil you have. If you don't have the 
 B.Rang, you need to get it -- it's stuck in a rock in the Krypt, near where
 you fought EyeSpy. Once it's fixed, exit to the world map and head towards
 the beach. Instead of entering the water, head northeast until you find a

 Show the man the completed B.Rang and he'll talk about the GrimFowl, and how

  Now that I beat the idea of having Karn's fusion into your head, make sure
  you have it on. Have Nina use Atk-Up on Shin'D-out Karn and have Zack turn
  into a thunder dragon. Ox can attack and heal and Nina can do the same, but
  this should be over in a heartbeat -- Karn's fusion rips everything up.
  GrimFowl will use the single-target Burn Out and projectile attacks.

 Take the [EGG] for real this time and exit to the north, making sure a bird
 is following _right_ behind you.

 With a bird in tow, the party leader throws the egg into the castle and makes
 the guard regiment get turned topsy-turvy. You can now enter inside.

 Go through the chaotic corridors and find the down-stairway in the SE corner.
 Before you go down, push the two pots there south to find a [LIFE2] and a
 [SKULLRG]! Follow the ensuing passage, heal up when you get to the breakable
 wall, and proceed. The General commends your effort but sends three lackeys
 at you...

  Have Zack transform into the thunder dragon, Fusion Karn attack, Nina buff
  Karn with Atk-Up, and Ox smash things like the hulk. Each Slime has less
  than ~480 HP, so Karn should be able to kill 'em in one hit (+ Atk-Up). Of
  course, the slimes are sort of fast and can do ~30 damage per hit -- Nina
  makes that pain go away, so long as they don't all attack one person, which
  I would assume is really rare. When all three are dead, they transform into
  one single SlimeX, which only has about 500-600 HP. This boss only uses a
  simple attack, too, making it even easier to repair the damage.

 Afterwards, Ox' wife says the ship was loaded with the secret weapon and now
 Prima is about to be destroyed. You automatically go to...

 which you can get by moving onto the fishyface's bed (after he moves) and
 inspecting the spot.

 Stay at the inn, re-Shin Karn, and exit town. Remember that moving thing in
 and around Arad's area? That's the town we're lookin' for. Get onto dry land,
 warp to Arad, then leave for the village in the shifting sands nearby...

 [Thanks to Gnutz for telling the exact time this section was doable!]

 Anyway, return to Nabal and enter the jail cell in the first downstairs area.
 Have Ox break the wall and follow the passage to [MAGICRG] and a [CURE].
 That's all there is here, so you can leave. If you go upstairs to the throne
 room, you can make two bridges appear for easier access (not that you'll 
 need to come back here).
 
 Also, if you haven't gotten 'em already, you can find a [LIFE2] and [SKULLRG]
 by inspecting under the two pots at the stairway that leads to the jail cell
 (from dungeon entrance).

 [Stephen Gonzales writes:] when you are in the kings throne, a little bit

 Not a very hospitable place, it seems -- only spectres roam the towns and no
 shops are open. Head into the down-stairway nearby.

                               rooms to trudge through. There are breakable
                               walls in the first and third rooms that you'll
have to crunch to get some treasures, and to get #5 Ox needs to break a few
rocks. Taking the "EX" stair out of the monster-infested area makes the party
arrive back in town, at the isolated shrine. Heal at the freshwater fountain
and go up to the second floor. Approach the sorceress and the two spectres 
from before want you to prove your worth. So, same ol' same ol'.

  No, they don't all come out and fight you at once, but you still have to
  fight all three consecutively (order: Wisp -> Cloud -> Myst) so you'll want
  to finish each battle in top shape if possible. Wisp is a pushover and can
  be defeated with regular attacks, and its multi-hit attack (~20dmg) barely
  leaves a scratch. Cloud uses T. Bolt on a single character and Devistate
  which does 45 damage to everyone (always). Luckily the latter doesn't come
  consecutively (AFAIK) so you can always manage to heal, even if Ox has to
  use Cura3. Finally, Myst uses Blizzard (40dmg to everyone) and Burn Out 
  (~30dmg). The usual strategy of having Zack change into a thunder dragon and
  attack, Ox attack, Shin'D-out Karn attack, and Nina heal/Fort/Atk-Up when 
  needed.

 Afterwards, the spirits rouse the sorceress (Bleu) from her slumber and she
 gives the party an [OLDEGG]. She says to place it in the undersea volcano and
 come back when it's finished. A typhoon will be a-brewin' very soon...

 Warp to Gant and go underwater, heading north of Prima to the volcano.

 Not too labyrinthe but the monsters are still annoyances here, hitting for
 ~25 damage a pop if you're not using Mrbl3s to avoid fighting. When you get
 to the room where the "6" is on the map, there will be lava around the base
 of the cliff. Walk on the thin piece jutting out and press the action button
 to drop the OldEgg into the lava. Doing so automatically brings you back to
 our old friend Bleu in Wisdon. She joins up permanently and you're off again
 to Prima on a dime.

 With the OldEgg having grown larger in the volcano's depths, you take a rest
 in town. Outfit Bleu as best you can because as soon as you try to leave you
 will head out to meet the enemy. Gobi will now have a "Big Fish" ability and
 you can travel underwater faster and without enemies being able to engage in
 battle.

 The Typhoon Bug will do its work on the Dark Dragon armada, until they drop
 underwater. When you're let off, head north on the sea floor and one of the
 fishyfaces will ask you to take out the leader of the bunch. It seems Gills
 have become popularized since you got 'em...

 | BOSS: Pincher | HP: ~1100 | EP: 5775 | GP: 5775 |
 o---------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Have Zack and Karn turn into the thunder dragon/Shin, respectively, and use
  Ox to bash the monster. If you want to use Bleu she has some decent spells,
  but I suggest switching her out for Nina so you can have a healer. Whichever
  route you take, Pincher gets murdered by thunder-based spells, so having as
  many as you want helps you. The boss' regular attacks hit for about 30ish,
  and its T. Bolt spells hit EVERYONE for 95 damage. You'll almost have to
  spend a turn undoing that damage -- don't forget that Ox knows Cura3!

 A cutscene afterwards introduces 4 of the D. Dragon Commander's sub-generals
 who are dispatched to kick your allies' behinds and take the Goddess Keys.
 Gobi also joins the party permanently. When you return to the world map, our
 greedy fishyface comments that he's "missing something" -- go back to the
 guild leader and he'll drop two treasure chests for him. Obtain the [MYSTSF]
 and the [SPHERE]! Upgrade Bleu's equipment as your coinpurse allows and leave
 town.

 Gobi can turn into a fish when he's in the lead (when you have the Sphere,
 that is) so change into it now. Go north towards the Sea Volcano but steer
 west over the once-unpassable abyss -- this lets you into the other side of
 the ocean. There's a lot of extra stuffs to do about now

 NOTE: You have to come here later in the game, so go now so you don't have
       to do lots of backtracking!

 ---

 To get here, cross the underwater abyss with Gobi's Big Fish ability and
 follow the southern wall. When you get to a passage normally unpassable due
 to jagged rocks, head due west and you'll reach and island. Tunlan's there.

 Lots of, uh, stuff to see here, most notably everyone who plays a flute and
 the Nina lookalike with amnesia. Good equips too. Head north to the house
 and use the stairway to find a treasury with some stone monsters "guarding"
 it. The gate can't be lockpicked (!) but when you approach any of the other
 chests, you'll get pushed into a trapdoor. Make sure you fall in the left
 trapdoor. 

 You'll fall in some living quarters with boxes around. The SW box is on top
 of a [ROD5] fishing tool for Zack, the best actually! Push the SE box and
 fall into a room with a [MELON] / [HERB] chest.

 If you're not familiar with the Rod5, it lets Zack play fisherman to some 
 top-notch special equipment of his. They're available now, if you want to
 get 'em. More of that in awhile.

 Exit Tantar and head due west until you hit the coastline. Travel north from

 may be able to get a [SLAB]. Once you do, it's time to go to the next area.

 the mountains that lets you get to the coastline. Head south until you find
 a meadow with another well. Fish out the [DRAGONHT]!

 Exit Romero and put Bo in the lead. Head west through the forest, past Karma
 Tower, until you hit a range of mountains running north/south. Head north and
 arc around them, continuing the westward trek. There's another broken-down
 well nearby, from which Zack can land a [DRAGONSD]! You'll have to give up
 the B.Rang to use it, but it's about +50 attack power, so make the right
 choice, yo.

o--------------------------------------o

 NOTE: You must have the DragonSD to proceed!

 En route to GrimFowl Woods, you may have noticed a path going west. Well,
 it is in that direction you will be going. Go back through the Hidden Fort
 to get in position, and follow the mountain path west, south, then back 
 east along the seaside. The shrine is near there.

 Make Zack the party leader to gain entrance, then take the [MRBL2] chest at
 the right side of the dragon. Talk to the dragon to start the second test.

 | BOSS: Bain | HP: ~1100 | EP: 1020 | GP: 360 |
 o------------o-----------o----------o---------o

  To quote Dumb & Dumber: "Pretty bird!" This blue avion will be fighting Zack
  mano e mano, as is the usual. Its exterior doesn't bely its mediocre attack
  strategies -- with the DragonSD and DragonHT, this is ten times as easy. 
  Bain'll still be faster than Zack and can do critical "Slam" hits, so, like
  last time, anticipate healing. Transform into the thunder dragon to really
  take this toucan to town (plus, ThrDr heals you to full!). The boss expires
  once its HP is depleted; no second wind like some others.

 For your conquest of Bain, you'll receive four new dragon transformations
 from the Dragon God: IceDgn, FirDgn, BltDgn, and GldDgn! Now, back to the
 storyline, eh?

o--------------------------------------o

 To reach Gust, you need get in the water and head north of Tunlan where a
 beach is. If you haven't been to Tunlan, the beach is the westernmost beach
 on the north side (if that makes sense to you). Once landborne, head west
 to an orchard, then north across the brige towards town.

 In the house left of the pond, push the crate out of the way and fall into
 a basement portion. There are some barrels here that prevent access to a
 wizard, which can give Karn a fusion spell. The formation is:


[1][2][3]  To get this "puzzle" out of the way, go like so:
[4]   [5]
   [6]     1) Push [6] left or right
           2) Push [4] left
           3) Push [5] right
           4) Push [1] and [3] north
           5) Push [2] left or right

 You can now get to the spellmaster behind the barrels. Put Karn in the lead
 and talk to the wizard, who'll give Karn the Debo spell, which combines him,
 Ox, and Gobi. Since it can only be used underwater, it's not THAT useful,
 but still pretty cool.

 In town, you may notice a few people saying that Nicholie is the only one
 who can fix the destroyed bridge to Scande; and, that some guy had his lunch
 stolen by a Fly. This will be attended to later. For now, head north out of
 town and into the Gust's "valley" where the iron door on the mountainside 
 leads to...

  They hit for about 17, while your party can probably hit for 300+. Nothing
  much to worry about if you're rested up at the inn. Just beware that they
  can "Slam" for a lot of damage, if your characters are weak-DEF. Karn's
  transformation can really smoke these roaches.

 Return to the mousy gathering and talk to the mouse guarding the treasure
 chests. You'll be permitted entrance and get the [HERB] and [M.CURA] item.
 The party leader automatically leaves and uses the potion, restoring all to

  Have Zack change into the Ice Dragon, Karn use Shin and attack, Ox smash up
  the bad guy, and Nina play healer (duh!). Ruga's multi-hit breath attack can
  kill (~120dmg!) those with weak DEF, so you may have to throw a few Life2s
  around. Luckily, Ruga dies without any hassle at the end -- this boss has no
  extra HP left in him.

 Afterwards, RugaX turns out to be...Nicholie! Bleu says she'll need Oil to
 help him, though, and that comes from frogs... She directs you to Frog Cave!
 Before you go, however, in the western part of town, the man who said his
 lunch was stolen has moved from the cave entrance. Follow it to the end and
 you'll find a cheese-eating fly...who attacks you!

  Uh, it's a stupid 'boss,' but it can deal lots of damage with 'Slam' attacks
  should it get one off. Otherwise, transform, fusion, blahblahblah kill! Take
  the [G.FLY] when you're done and leave town. Once back in the water, head
  to the southeasternmost part of the Western Ocean, swimming to the beach
  that's blocked (from foot travel) by spikey rock formations. Once on land,
  head to the cave.

 The middle frog strikes a bargain: Oil for a G.Fly. Since you should already
 have a G.Fly, he'll give you the Oil straight away. If you don't have the
 fly in question, go back to Gust and enter the cave in the west part of town,
 killing the G.Fly. Back to town...

 Nicholie and his attending nurses (:p) are in the house just right of where
 you enter. The bridge-builder says to destroy the poison flower, and when
 Bleu looks in her crystal ball, it explodes! Not a bad omen, I hope...
 Head north into the valley to find Cort standing by the poison flower. He
 says it's hungry...!

 o---------------o-----------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: FlowerX | HP: ~1800 | EP: 3850 | GP: 3609 |
 o---------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Have Zack turn into the bolt dragon, Karn use the Shin fusion and attack,
  Ox tempers his hammer on the boss, and Nina heals. The boss' regular slap
  does about 50 damage, and can poison you. If you get poisoned, have Nina
  alleviate it and Ox act as the healer. Pretty basic stuff. I've heard of
  people who've found this battle tough, but I don't really see it.

 Cort flees once his creation's been deep-sixed, and the lunatic people of
 Gust'll be out from under the flower's control. Karn will have to turn back
 into Shin, but don't do it right now; heal up with items before you leave,
 too.

 Back at Nicholie's bedside and Gobi'll say there's a monster causing commotion
 ...but the  monster is really Nicholie! Whathehex!?

 | BOSS: RugaX | HP: ~800  | EP: 4162 | GP: 3121 |
 o-------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  The annoying this is that you'll have to re-Shin Karn. ARGH! Switch your
  lineup to suit yourself. For me, it's Ox/Zack/Nina/Shin Karn. Have Zack
  change into the Ice Dragon, Karn use Shin and attack, Ox smash up the bad
  guy, and Nina play healer (duh!). Ruga's multi-hit breath attack can kill
  (~120dmg!) those with weak DEF, so you may have to throw a few Life2s around.
  It's basically the same as before, which is why I copy-and-pasted the prior
  strat. >=p

 After the incredibly stupid 'stall' battle, Nicholie is back to normal and
 decides to fix the valley's bridge to repay the debt. Everyone automatically
 rests. Now that everyone's back to normal, check the house left of the pond
 and find the flute-maker. Search his bed for a [MAESTRO], which you'll need
 later (get now so you don't have to backtrack).

 Head back to the bridge, which is near where you fought the FlowerX boss.
 Approach and Cort will...uh, change into a Mighty Morphin Toad.

 o----------------o-----------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: HornToad | HP: ~4000 | EP: 6800 | GP: 7000 |
 o----------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Zack should use BltDgn, Nina heals, Ox smashes and uses Cura3 if needed,
  and Shin Karn attacks. The Squash attack can do quite a bit of damage to
  DEF-crappy characters (~100dmg), but usually it's not too bad. If you have
  Nina defend until she has to heal, she can survive. The multi-attacking
  "stomp" skill can do around ~70 to the party members, except Zack who'll
  take significantly less damage. When HornToad "gets mad" when its HP is 
  depleted, Nina should defend to stay alive. For some reason, Shin Karn'll
  be taking more damage than usual, but he should have lots of HPs to sustain
  himself.

 Cort bemoans his own stupidity before exploding, and Nicholie beckons you to
 head into Scande, 'cross the bridge. Heal and save back in town before 
 setting out.

 Inside this cavern, enter the doorway the little she-mole is in. As one of
 the mole-kids says, "The Dark Dragons are exploiting us." They want you to
 break Mogu from his comatose state, that Mote (1 of 4 generals, remember)
 placed him under. Talk to the elder who wants an item from Tunlan to break
 his state; accept to obtain a [COWL].

 Warp to Tunlan or, if you hate doing sidequests and didn't go there, you'll
 have to backtrack. To get there, head to the beach near Gust and swim south;
 the island should be in the east a little from there.

o--------------------------------------o

 With all modes of communication open, the hospitality's a little better now.
 Enter the northernmost house and talk to the green-robed granny to learn 
 about the Bolster, an item for entering dreams. Accept to solve her problem
 -- the princess wants to give the TmKey to Zog, who she's smitten with -- and
 the Bolster's yours.

 Head upstairs and talk to the Princess, infatuated with eternal youth (and
 idiocy), before returning to the granny. The marks on the princess' back
 show how to open the safe, and when you follow the granny to the safe, she
 says the princess likes to swim at night...the marks are visible...

 Exit Tunlan and wait for it to be night; or, use the DkKey and make it night
 immediately. Re-enter town and you'll find the princess' throne blocked from
 voyeurs and intruders(!), as the guards call the men party leaders. So how
 to view? Go back to the first floor, take the stairs to the second, and
 instead of descending again, enter through the west wall (has a crack in it).
 Approach the pool from behind the nearest palm and "inspect" it with the
 action button to see the marks:

 "Blue, Red, and White, from left to right"

 Return to the granny, tell her about the findings, then inspect the left
 part of the safe door. After inspecting the second, the troll statues'll go
 haywire and jump down the hole, right before the princess and her escort 
 come to see the commotion.

 ...and in the confusion of Bleu blowing up the doors, Cerl (1 of 4 generals,
 remember) takes the key. After Bleu blows everyone up (lol?), go back to the
 safe and take the [BOLSTER], the two [MELON]s, and an [M. DROP]. You can get
 the chests in front of the trapdoors by flanking 'em. Anyway, back to Gramor,
 folks.

 This place is annoying because of the floor switches. Stepping one one makes
 the walls vanish (still there, though) and you end up stumbling around until
 you hit another switch, making the walls show up again. Your destination is
 a little boy standing on a stairway. To get to him from where you enter:

 01) Step on the first switch
 02) Head west to next switch, making walls reappear
 03) Follow western path until you step on obscured switch
 04) Continue east to next switch
 05) Double-back west and take southern 'alley'
 06) Take the nearest southern alley from there
 07) Follow path south, west, and south until you see an eastern path
 08) Take that path to the boy on the stairway.

 Talk to him and choose to fight him, even though he says you'll never be able
 to do so. When you engage with the Mothro boss, run away and have Bleu warp
 you out of the tower (w/ Exit). Go back towards Dream Town and talk to Ann at
 the town icon before entering.

 Go back in the house where you entered the dream world and talk to Ann. She
 says a "very wise man" fixed the bridge to the south, and the mole nearby
 says Courage is being kept in the southern cave (yes, this game is simple).
 Exit town, but not before healing up and/or buying more Mrbl3s.

 On the world map, head west of town and you'll find a bridge's been made.
 Follow it south and enter the eastern Wilderness, via the middle "alley" in
 the hills.

 If you touch a steam stream, you'll lose 2 HP. This can stack up if you're
 fumbling and stumbling, so watch where you step. As you walk, you'll snake
 your way east, west, then east, then west, ad nauseum. The first chest you
 see is a [LIGHTSH], right off the side of the path -- get it!

 Travel west until a break in the bone-walls allows you to go north (west is
 a dead end). You should see a chest nearby but you can't get to it -- it's
 just a [LIFE]. To get it, continue along the way until you find another
 northern alley; continue east. Brave the geyser-infested gauntlet to get 
 said [LIFE], and if you continue, to a [HEADGEAR]. The north way you passed
 is the way to go, though.

 Make it through the walls of steam (annoying, hmm?) and you'll be spit out
 near the destination. Enter.

 Time to see the kid again. If you don't remember the way:

 01) Step on the first switch
 02) Head west to next switch, making walls reappear
 03) Follow western path until you step on obscured switch
 04) Continue east to next switch
 05) Double-back west and take southern 'alley'
 06) Take the nearest southern alley from there
 07) Follow path south, west, and south until you see an eastern path
 08) Take that path to the boy on the stairway.

 This time, the kid retreats instead of fighting. Go up to the second floor,
 which can be navigated like so:

 09) Follow path until first (working) switch
 10) Follow the inviz path north, west, and zig-zag southwest to the next
     switch
 11) Go south and take the path east (you should see the stairway)
 12) When you find a west corridor, take it to the stairway

 You should be on the third floor now.

 13) Follow path to the first working switch
 14) Head south to the orange switch, which turns the walls back on
 15) Take one step north and head east
 16) Follow the inviz path west, north, west, and north.
 17) You should see an orange switch off the east side of the path now.
 18) To get to it, exit "under" it on the screen (i.e. go east) and follow
     to the switch
 19) Take the stairway up.

 Fourth floor, going up! Luckily, this floor's a joke and there's an on/off
 switch every couple of steps. They lead to the kid, so heal up before you
 approach and talk to him.

  Mothro lacks a health meter, so you'll be fighting in the dark so to speak.
  Turn Zack into the BltDrgn, Karn use the Shin transformation, Ox attack and 
  alleviate poison, and Nina heal up. Mothro often makes weapon attacks fail
  (in Pokemon Double Team fashion), so magickin' the guy is the way to go.
  You can actually fight with Bleu instead of Nina here, although Nina's Idle
  spell seems to work. Besides "Poison," Mothro can use "Shock!" which can
  kill a target and "Time Out" which inflicts paralysis. Overall, a pretty
  lukewarm boss fight; it just takes awhile with the boss' evasion abilities.

o--------------------------------------o

 Warp to Tantar and exit town. Go north towards the Lake Cave, following the
 road to the end of its length. North of there should be a slope onto a tree-
 -covered cliff; go east around it then north. You should come to a marking
 of a dragon. Have Mogu dig there and you'll come to an underground cavern...

 Four chests here. The northwest one (Clog) is a deathtrap and the northeast
 one is a HP/AP healer, so you can figure out the order. Or, have Karn disarm
 the bad one. Either way, you get an [L. PTN], [A. PTN], [V. PTN], and also a
 [CLOG]. The Clog's an accesory that raises the Active/MagDef stat. Distribute
 it as necessary, then touch the teleport device to leave.

 Onto the next marking!

o--------------------------------------o

 Warp to Camlon and head towards Nanai. Before you get to the west part of
 the once-city (=p), head north to a riverbank that touches shoulders with a
 marking. Dig down and you'll find a treasure of a different sort...a spell
 for Karn! Make Karn the party leader (Reverted from current transformation)
 and the wizard'll teach him the Doof spell. 

 It sounds funny, but it makes him strong. Strong enough to move heavy things,
 in fact, which is why you should head to Bleak. Teleport out on the pad and
 warp to the den of thieves that is...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

o--------------------------------------o

 Remember the fortuneteller's house where she swindles you? It's just north of
 the dragon shrine. Inside, you may remember a heavy box you can't push. Well,
 with the Doof simulation, you can shove it aside and enter the room below.
 ...And it's another wizard! Talk to the man with Karn (normal) in the lead to
 learn the Puka spell! Wowee zowee, huh?

 Exit back into the house again and find the other huge box. Push it north,
 then push the pot west, allowing you to enter the hole beyond. You should
 fall by some barrels. Push the left one north and the right one east so you
 can get at the large box nearby. Push it up and inspect beneath it to find a
 [CLEARCL] armor for the women! If you're big on using Nina, this could really
 help her stay alive a lot longer. =)

 So, now you have Puka...think there's anything else to do? You're dang right!
 Puka can open strange doors and such, so where have we seen those...?

o--------------------------------------o

 A little north of Auria is one of those strange doors. With Puka in the lead,
 you can blow it to the side and take the [DARKBR] inside. It's an accessory
 for Karn, which raises Active/Fate/MagDef some. Definitely worthwhile. Now,
 if you want to make use of Puka again, warp to Gust.

o--------------------------------------o

 Exit Gust to the south and head towards the southwestern beach. Where you
 once broke land, there's a door in plain sight. Open it with Puka and reap
 the LoveBR! It's a female accessory, so slap it on one of them. :p

 The Winter Cave is actually a two-screen walkway, so you can get through it
 with about one Mrbl3. It's recommended, in fact, since Nautulis foes appear
 quite often appear in twos and threes, plus MORE enemies. It's annoying and
 you don't have to sit through that crap.

 The Flower enemy has about 500+ HP, so unless you have the Puka simulation
 for Karn or a lot of power from level-grinding, running is a good idea. And
 speaking of good things, there's a town directly east of the cave exit.

 The largest (widest) house in town has a [HERB] bureau and the inn's bureau
 has a [CLOG]. Now that the larceny's out of the way, you can put your ear to
 the ground and see what the regular folk has to say. Some say that the Spyre
 in the south controls the climate (it's frozen in this area, in case you've
 got glaucoma) and another says that the entrance can only be opened by one of
 the mole people...and we've got one of those!

 Buy some equipment for Mogu if you're using him in the main party (QuartzAR
 and IronCL, if possible), and get some Mrbl3s if you're running short. A note
 of advice, though -- you'll be getting two great armors in the near future
 and Mogu can equip both.

 If you want to land on the world map closer to the tower destination, use one
 of the stairs to walk on the frozen creek and slip-'n'-slide out the way in
 the south. Once you're at the tower's base, use Mogu's diggin' claws on the
 draconic marking to enter...

 This place isn't too hard, so there's really no reason for a map.

 From where you enter, head south up the extra-long hallway to the stairway --
 this brings you down to a system of bridges in a waterway. In the south are a
 pair of treasure chests out of reach. We'll get 'em in a sec. First, from 
 where you start out, loop clockwise to a [CURE2] chest, then backtrack.

 Follow the canal-tops east and take the first mini-stair you see north. When
 you get to the fork, continue east, which takes you south in the process. At
 the island you come to, make a pitstop to get the [A. PTN] and [SHELL] chests
 you find. Keep on truckin' west to find a platform with the exit stairway; do
 not take it yet, as the chests you're seeking are west a little more. They're
 a [FLAMEAR] and [WORLDAR] -- two excellent armors, both of which Mogu can use
 if you held off on buying him one in Spring like I said. Take the stairs you
 bypassed up into a green field.

 Yes, there's a huge lawn up here. Slimes, Fleas, and other crappy enemies you
 can decimate with one attack appear here, so save your Mrbl3s if you want. To
 exit in this neverending sea of grass, venture northeast of the starting area
 to come to the exit platform.

 Now, you're subjected to a huge black, rainy backdrop -- a similar expanse
 that you have to navigate. Zombies, Ameblobs, and a few other enemies from
 dungeons past appear now...see a running theme? This time, the platform to
 the above floor is southwest of the one you start. Also, if you want to exit
 the tower COMPLETELY (read: to world map), search the northern wall for a gap
 and enter it. If you're ready to come along, hit 'em up to the next floor.

 This time 'round, you've got a huge sandbox to play in. SandClods, Scorps,
 and a few other Arad-area enemies come up from their pits to party with the,
 well, party. To find the exit platform, head due east from the starting one
 until you hit the wall, then go south. The newest floor's style is...

 ...WINTER! Yay. You'll see a gap to southern wall nearby -- DO NOT TAKE IT,
 for, as you guessed, it kicks your behind out a window and you land on the
 world map. Warlocks, D. Knights, and some other contemporaries on par with
 your team (hopefully, you're better) now show up, so Mrbl3s can come in a
 bit more handy. This time the exit's a little easier to trek to -- just go
 straight north! No compass required.

 The fifth stage in this wond'rous wild ride is the sky level, complete with
 a windy-cloud portrait as a background. Phoenix (Bain pallete-swap) shows
 up here, and a few other new arrivals...again, Mrbl3 if you're not in the
 mood. The exit is in the southwestern corner of the gigantor boxed-in area.

 No, you're not in the Twilight Zone -- it's just the sixth and final stage
 to the tower's trickery! The enemies are mostly the same fare as before, so
 surprises they ain't. Head northeast to find a platform with a machine that
 needs a key and a glowing totem. Inspect the pole, take off your fisticuffs,
 and duke it out with...well, nothing. Mote surprises you and warps you off
 to...

 Haha, like "Nightmare." Get it? -___-

 Talking around can tell you that this is a dream world, controlled by Mote.
 Gawd, not again. A geezer sleeping in a bed says that Mote needs to be done
 away with for everyone to return, that his consciousness will belie where he
 resides.

 Exit onto the world map after you've healed up/bought items, where you'll
 find there are no enemies! Finally, a stroke of good fortune. From Mare Town,
 head south along the ridge and you'll find a slope that lets you get up on 
 said ridge. Follow it until you come to a cave at the base of an ivory tower.
 Gives new sense to the phrase, huh?

   | |
   |_|        So, by on-screen direction, here's how you'll find Mote in the
  ENTER       labyrinthine second stretch of the tower:

 01) Head north, step on the path-switcher device
 02) Follow west to next path-switcher device
 03) Continue on southern path to next path-switcher
 04) Continue north to next switcheroo device
 05) Head east and take first southern walkway to a north/south split. Go
     south to spinning tile.
 06) Go west to switch panel.
 07) Go west, skip the first northern alley, but take the second one to a
     spinning tile.
 08) Continue west and north to exit tile.

 Probably the most annoying part of the game, IMO -- at least you had a guide
 to help you through and eliminated all the fumbling trial-and-error crap.
 This new area will have three stairways (one isolated) with some glowing
 mustard- and ketchup-colored tiles. The tiles seem to hurt everyone in the
 active party 'cept the party leader, although this may just be my setup on
 Zack (?). Either way, you don't want to do a jig on these things since they
 inflict -3 HP each time you walk on one. 
 
 Go up the stair (middle) with the purple panel in front of it, arriving at
 a second-floor area filled with yellow tiles. Head south of the yellow tile
 figuration (shaped like a middle finger...?) and go a bit east, at which time
 you should fall through a trapdoor into the isolated stairway below.

 Follow the tiny stairways until you get to a room with just five up-stairways
 (not counting the one you come up) arranged like so:

                    [1]        The "[E]" being the entrance one, of course.
                               Take the "[5]" stairway; if you take any of
       [2]  [3]                the others you'll wind back up at the initial
                               room and have to start over. Once the correct
       [E]  [4]  [5]           passage's been taken, you'll end up in Mote's
                               chambers and, boy, is he not excited to see you
 knocking on his door.

 o------------o-----------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Mote | HP: ~3500 | EP: 5400 | GP: 6000 |
 o------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Use physical attacks right off the bat and heal when Mote uses physical
  attacks (~40-70dmg). On the second turn, he'll talk some jive...until his
  conscience arrives and "blocks his power." How does he do it? No idea. The
  battle will then start anew.

  You'll find that when you physically attack Mote, his pixels proliferate a
  bit, making physical attacks do more damage and magical attacks less damage.
  If you have Zack in the BltDgn state, he'll be doing pitiful damage but a
  nice meat shield. Basically, all you can do is attack and heal when it uses
  its physical attack. When its HP is depleted and "Mote gets mad" over it, he
  starts using Inferno (90dmg to one target), which is easily smoothed over w/
  Cura2. This battle can take awhile, particularly if you have Mogu and he can
  die easier than most, but it's just an attack-and-heal kind of battle. Just
  attack when he's all blurred and use throw magick at him when he is (which
  will re-obscure him). Karn should be in his Puka transformation, naturally
  -- his Slam can do 600+!

 After Mote takes a dirtnap, you'll be back in Spyre. Search the totem for a
 [SKYKEY] and use the machine nearby to switch the outside area to defrost.
 Use Bleu's exit to get back on the world map. Back to Spring!

 The winter of Spring's discontent has passed and it's...uh, spring again. 
 This also means you can enter the obligatory waterfall cave the town's famous
 for having. Before that, though, if you have the Rod5, you can fish up the
 [DRAGONAR] from the duck pond. To find it, head into two and wade in the west
 river. You can find the duckpond near there. Equip the Rod5 and some bait to
 Zack and he'll fish it out from the dock. Whether you like it as much as the
 LifeAR is really moot -- you should get it because it's a requirement for the
 temple later on!

 When you're ready to skidaddle, wade in the river and duck behind the falls.
 It's just a two-area dungeon that leads to the world map. Duh, right?

 Search the inn's bureau to find the [RUBYRG], first and foremost, then locate
 the moving man in the town square. He says that time's stopped (explaining 
 why no one talks to you or moves) and drops a hint that it may have something
 to do with the "Tock" in the east...

 Before you do anything, find the northeastern windmill house and get to the
 second floor. Move a barrel and search its former spot for a [W. ANT]. Should
 you need to heal up or buy stuff, you'll have to warp elsewhere; at least you
 can warp back, which is all this town's good for currently.

 To find "Tock," exit south of town to find a forest. As you head east, hug
 the northern cliffs (you go NE) until you find a slope you can use to get a
 better vantage point. East of there is another slope where a tower sits, but
 you need to walk with Bo, meaning you diffuse (:p) Karn.

 Too intricate for maps, so we'll have to do this junk by the book. =(

[FIRST FLOOR]

 To begin with, head north from where you enter to find a "ring" of arrow'd
 pads. Ignore 'em (healing fountain to the north, though) and head west to an
 arrow by itself. Take it to teleport through the wall, then teleport through
 that wall. Approach the third "<-" teleport but go north instead of takin'
 it, where you can get an [ICYAR] chest. I gave it to Ox, since Zack had the
 DragonAR. Now, use the arrows to get to the western wall, then walk back to
 where the healing fountain area is.

 Use the "<-" once to wall-shift, and BEFORE you take the next, head north to
 a [LIFE] chest, then continue north for a [EVILCN] for Bleu. Continue north
 to a left-pointing arrow, then loop to the small room west of there for
 another <- arrow. This should warp you to an antechamber with a stairway in
 it. If you're confused, just remember you have a bird's-eye view and can see
 the destination. Onward!

[SECOND FLOOR]

 Take the nearby [CURE] chest and warp into the north/south corridor. Use the
 "->"s to move to the eastern screen boundary, then loop counterclockwise to
 back to the eastern screen boundary. Use the "<-" to enter the southeastern
 room with a stairway in it. Vamoose from this floor, pronto!

[THIRD FLOOR]

 Wow, you end up right by a [G. TIARA] chest and use the down arrow to shift
 to the ground. BE CAREFUL YOU DO NOT STRAY TOO FAR SOUTH OR YOU CAN FALL OUT
 OF THE TOWER. Solve the easy "puzzles" nearby for a [LIFE2] and [GUARDSH]
 chest pair. Go upstairs when you're ready.

[FOURTH FLOOR]

 There's a huge maze of these idiot tiles here, and two chests in the middle
 of 'em, as well as two stairways. The stair closes to the west edge cannot be
 entered from this floor, luckily, so you can put that out of your mind.

 The nearest chest to the west wall is the [AGILEHT]. To get it:

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 01) Go to northern wall and look for this configuration:

     [->][<-]  [->][<-]  [->][<-]
  [/\]      [/\]      [<-]<================= Enter this tile from the north
  [/\]      [/\]      [/\]                   and this'll begin the steps to
     [/\][<-]  [/\][<-]  [/\][/\]            get the item.

 02) Once in the "ring," take the <- to the south.
 03) Head south to the <- tile
 04) Head west on the <- tile
 05) Take the downward tile to the treasure box
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To get the [WOLFSKIN] chest:

 01) Enter from the point used in Step #1 of the previous chest-getter proof.
 02) Go south onto the <- tile
 03) Go west on the <- tile
 04) Go south on the downward tile
 05) Go east on the -> tile
 06) Go south on the -> tile
 07) Go on the downward tile that is directly left of the chest nearby
 08) Go east on the -> tile
 09) Go north on the <- tile

 To get out of this hellhole:

 01) Follow the WolfSkin-getting directions to Step #8
 02) Go west to the downward tile
 03) Go east on the -> tile
 04) Go east on the upwards tile
 05) Go north on the upwards tile
 06) Go north on the <- tile
 
 ...and take the stairs up!

[FIFTH FLOOR]

 The stairway in the left leads back to the annoying arrow pads, so stay away
 unless you like doing annoying things repeatedly. Heal up and head up the
 northern alley to find Cerl and, of course, you don't fight her at once. This
 time, the battle is stalled as you get sucked into a time-space continuum
 rip and...whatever. You're crapped out onto the world map, at which point you
 should walk back to Carmen. Everyone got separated, so you'll be Zack only at
 the moment... Use a Mrbl3 because some monsters can use Shock! (instantdeath)
 on you.

 When Zack arrives, Nina and the others gather for a meeting. Apparently, Alan
 and Cerl were childhood friends and he ends up going to Tock to see what's up
 with her (he claims she'd never help the Dragons). Follow Alan and refuse
 Karn once you're back in the tower.

o--------------------------------------o--------------------------------------o

 Backtrack to where Cerl was (see previous section for methods) and you'll
 find her and Alan chatting. Unfortunately, Cerl transforms into a giant
 preying mantis-type monster, and we all know what those do to their male
 friends... *gulp*

 | BOSS: Cerl | HP: ~3500 | EP: XXXX | GP: XXXX |
 o------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Uh, Cerl sucks, plain and simple -- you've probably hard a harder time on
  the Gremlin boss. She'll attack for mediocre damage (~50-70) on one person
  and buff herself with some magicks. Have Zack attack with BltDrgn, Karn use
  the Puka transformation, Nina heal, and Bleu bombard with her best spells.
  In fact, Cerl seems to have around the same HP as the last boss, which is a
  thing considering the level of difficulty. Cerl can sometimes attack all of
  the party members for ~40 damage, but when Nina is barely hurt, you know the
  party upkeep's in good shape.

 Unfortunately for the party, Cerl can't be beaten this time as she threatens
 to speed up time in Carmen until everyone's dead. The party lands at the 
 South Castle, but Cerl enters and shuts everyone out. This time, Nina's with
 you when everyone's scattered in the wind, so you can warp to town outright.

o--------------------------------------o--------------------------------------o

 Enter the house north of the square fountain to find out Alan's been injured
 by Cerl's dastardly corruption of space-time-ness! When asked if there's any
 item that means a lot to Cerl, Alan says "Fruit" from the Holiday Tree where
 they grew up. That should remind her of the time they spent together so long
 ago (*nostalgiatear*).

 On the world map, return to where Zack was thrown the first time Cerl messed
 around with time. To get there, head like you normally would towards Tock,
 but look for a ramp leading south past the first forest you come to. There
 should be a lone tree by some town's ruins, and once you punch the tree w/
 Ox, you can take the [FRUIT] on the ground. 

 To get back to the South Castle, follow the path you're near east and when
 it goes south and disappears, follow it to the mountain pass. The castle is
 right nearby.

o--------------------------------------o

 With the Fruit in your inventory, Cerl's heart is warmed and you can enter
 the castle. Upstairs you'll find her with a blue chest, and she says that
 Alan'll never forgive her and they should just leave. Take the [TMKEY] and
 go back to Carmen......AGAIN. ARGH. Luckily there are some cool events that
 take place and I won't spoil 'em. You end up back at Tock.

 Crap goes wrong after Carmen's restored, though, and Nina's thrown into a
 space-time loop. Everyone ends up near Tunlan.

 A strange man by the dragon lord shrine says there was a famous doctor in
 Carmen. Go to the house near the princess' palace and talk to an old man to
 learn the girl in the house (Nina replica, remember) has amnesia. Now, put
 two and two together and it's time to revisit the unfrozen city.

o--------------------------------------o

 The northeastern windmill house is the doctor's, and when you talk to him he
 says a Tonic can be effective in alleviating the series. You'll need four 
 items: P. Fish, Root, C. Nut, and W. Ant. Locations are as follows:

 [W. ANT]

  You can find a [W. ANT] in the upstairs room of here, by moving the barrel
  and inspecting under it. Hopefully you haven't sold that yet, because you
  will have to wait for a white deer to appear on the overworld and kill it
  with Bo. And that can take awhile... Other locations for the W. Ant we've
  already come across in the game (with corresponding Ctrl+F sections):

  - Auria ["ARA1"]
  - Bleak ["BLK1"]

 [P. FISH]

  This one's easy. Head past where South Castle was (and see nice scene ^_^)
  and you'll find a marsh that's all icky and poisoned. Follow the dirt road
  to a broken bridge and fish off it, at which time you'll catch a P. Fish!
  This stands for "Poison Fish," so don't let anyone take a bit, y'dig?

 [ROOT]

  This one's a little hard to figure out, but when you think of roots, you
  may just make the connection to Gramor's mole-men. South of the town, on
  the world map, you can find some pale, swirly-lookin' plants. In front of
  the lone one, have Mogu dig and he'll come up with the root.

 [C. NUT]

  Obviously, this stands for "coconut," so you'll have to take a trip to the
  only deserted island you know of...Tunlan's! Well, the only inhabited one,
  that is. Warp there, exit onto the world map, and have Ox punch a tree to
  drop the item in question.

 When you've got all the items, return to Carmen and the doctor will make a
 herb stew for ya, culminating in a [TONIC] for the party. Before you go, 
 look for a strange man by a NE trough who tells you to "search here." When
 he disappears, take the [PASS] he left behind. This lets you enter Scande.

 Now, return to...

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| 100) Tunlan                                                          [TNL5] |

o--------------------------------------o

 Enter our li'l amnesiac's residence and she'll take the tonic, and she'll
 regain her bearings on everything. You'll also notice that Nina has the
 ability to fly on the world map...! Yay for her and the new portrait she's
 got. Too bad she couldn't come back with a huge defensive boost...

 You can fly to Scande (it's almost due south from Tock), or you can try out
 the new flying abilities and get some awesome items. Your call.

o--------------------------------------o

 From Tunlan, transform Nina into a giant bird and fly a smidgen north before
 crusing west. You'll arrive near Tock, and can find a dragon-marked hole at
 the foot of a mountain. Dig with Mogu to find a [HEROBW]. There's a toxin
 trap (poisons party leader), so have Karn disarm it.

 Let us proceed to the next place.

o--------------------------------------o

 If you don't know where Scande is, find the western edge of the continent and 
 head due south past the poisoned marsh. A big castle is denoted on the map,
 but you don't want to go there just yet. Keep flying south (and SE) until you
 find a dead-tree-infested area (near the ship drawn on the map). Use Mogu to
 dig at the dragon mark you find, landing near a treasure trove of treasures!

 Warp out when you've taken 'em all.

o--------------------------------------o--------------------------------------o

 You could probably do this earlier, like right after you get Ox, but I didn't
 remember to write it down. Anyone who knows the exact time, let me know and
 I'll rearrange this section.

 Anyway, return to Nabal and enter the jail cell in the first downstairs area.
 Have Ox break the wall and follow the passage to [MAGICRG] and a [CURE].
 That's all there is here, so you can leave. If you go upstairs to the throne
 room, you can make two bridges appear for easier access (not that you'll 
 need to come back here).
 
 Also, if you haven't gotten 'em already, you can find a [LIFE2] and [SKULLRG]
 by inspecting under the two pots at the stairway that leads to the jail cell
 (from dungeon entrance).

 [Stephen Gonzales writes:] when you are in the kings throne, a little bit
 southeast from there, theres an opening that leads to the outside of the
 castle.. and move up then left..(youre now in the docks/pier) and in the
 dead-end, in the lower-left corner, theres a "HIDDEN CLOG".

 NOTE: Having the DragonSH helps immensely. Cntrl+F the term for more info.

 ---

 North-northeast from Gust, you can find a temple isolated on top of a lake.
 With Nina's newfound flyin' powers, you can land near there and enter it.
 The man inside demands that you have the DragonAR before proceeding, so if
 you don't have it, go get it (fish with Rod5 in Carmen duck pond). Once the
 admittance's been granted, take the [MELON], heal up, and take the challenge.

 | BOSS: Avian | HP: ~3000 | EP: 1400 | GP: 1600 |
 o-------------o-----------o----------o----------o

  Avian bird flu is right! This pallette-swapped GrimFowl is quick, attacking
  first every round. This means you'll have to anticipate when you'll need to
  heal, but a rule of thumb is to use a Cure (or similar) when your HP is 
  below 75~80. Transform into the bolt dragon and attack away -- even the
  Tri-Rang pales in comparison to this. Sometimes the bird's attacks can fail,
  so that's something to look forward to. I took it on at around Lv. 23-24 and
  was able to get in two attacks before I had to use a Cure. For those who've
  power-levelled, this should be no sweat. Hopefully you won't have to eat a
  Slam from Avian, because that can screw you right there. [Reader Chinvincible
  recommends transforming into the Fire Dragon, whose attacks play off the
  boss' weakness, perhaps outdamaging the Bolt Dragon!]

 You'll be told your training is complete at this point and obtain the Rudra
 transformation. Congrats!

o--------------------------------------o

 Have Nina fly directly north of Agua and you'll find a tiny isle with what
 seems to be a house on it. A house it is not, but you can still find the
 [TRI-RANG] weapon for inspecting the landmark. Lighthouse, maybe? Either
 way, the Tri-Rang kicks the DragonSW's behind quite a lot.

o--------------------------------------o

 Using Nina's flying abilities (aren't they just so handy?), fly northeast of
 the cave near Romero. You won't have to fly far to see a dragon-marked patch
 of ground, and when you dig with Mogu, you'll find three treasure chests.
 The one out in the open is a [V. PTN] with a curse trap, the left one is a
 [S. PTN] with a fire trap, and the right's a [SASH] with a Boom trap.

 There's a healing fountain nearby, though, so the traps are inconsequential.

 Southwest of town is a beach and a Puka-only door. If you fly north of there,
 you can find an isolated well. Equip Zack with the Rod5 and some bait and he
 can fish out the superb [DRAGONSH] item. This raises his defense greatly, and
 if you've had trouble with the Avian boss, this'll almost halve its attack.
 Yes, it's that good.

o--------------------------------------o

 This is actually a bit of a sidequest, so I'll cover it all here.

 To begin with, you can find the I-Woman's home southwest of Tantar. It's on
 an island, but the rocky beach means you'll have to fly here. Talk to her
 and she'll ask you if you know of any other weapon fanatics. This is where
 the correspondance begins. Proceed as follows:

 01) Fly to the W-Man's Home (almost due south) and he'll let you take a
     list to the woman. Search his house for the [LIST] and two [HERB]s.
 02) Give the List to the I-Woman and she'll let you inside. Take the [WTZIT]
     from the chest.
 03) Give the Wtzit to the W-Man and he'll ask you to deliver back a letter.
 04) Show the letter to the I-Woman and she'll want you to bring another back.
 05) The old man says it's an [I.CLAW] and gives it to the party. He also says
     it's related to the mole people...

 You can't do anything more at this time, however. It just saves time.

o--------------------------------------o

 If you recall, this place is where you got some holy water to un-zombify the
 town of Romero. Well, now you've got some Gills, so you can actually delve
 deeper under the water. It's a dungeon without any major twists, so I trust
 you can get to the water part by yourself -- that's where this thing starts.

 ---

 Strange as it is, there's a temple under the water and if you've completed
 the other dragon shrines/temples, you will be allowed the Agni transformation
 that really lets loose one enemies. And, you get it without any hassle -- I
 guess this really is EASE cave, huh? =p

 enter. If you don't have the Pass, return to Carmen and talk to the stranger
 by the NE windmill house and search where he stood upon his vanishing.

 A normal man by the elevator says the lift's broken, and if you inspect it,
 you're told the parts are out of place. Oh well... Search the inn's bureau
 for an [HERB] and head south down the stairways as far as possible. There's
 nothing you can do here at the moment, so fly to Spring.

 the parts can be fixed in Gant, so off we go!

 Head into the northernmost house's second floor and talk to the old woman.
 She'll punch her husband out of bed so you can talk to him. Apparently the
 parts can be fixed while the party sleeps, so...they are. After the [PARTS]
 are received, it's back to Scande. You'll have to fly back since the town
 doesn't register as a town. =/

 Inspect the elevator, now, and the Parts'll fit. Climb the two lifts and
 enter the ornate door to find another mysterious figure. He says the D. Hurt
 can destroy any dragon, and since Zog can turn into one (if you listened to
 the Auria barkeep), this'll probably be of some use. It's found in Tunlan,
 so we'll have to return. Funny how the Bolster was considered a treasure but
 not this thing...

 Upon entering, head straight north into the first doorway. The flutist shows
 that the D. Hrt is actually a song, and bottles it for the party. Zack'll be
 hurt pretty badly from hearing it (naturally), so rest up before returning to
 Scande...400g for room service is pretty crappy.

 Re-enter Scande's tower and make your way east. There are no monsters on 
 this floor, but there are on the next -- organize your party and re-Puka
 Karn. The stairway you're looking for is by a healing fountain, which you
 should harness before heading up. On the floor right above, you can find a
 [MRBL1] and an [ICYCN], but can't progress further due to a locked gate.

 Back on the first floor, take the westernmost exit onto the second floor and
 start working from there.

 [SECOND FLOOR]

  East of where you come in, there are two chests in an open room. If this
  room is locked, go back to the first floor and take the middle stairway to
  find the floor-buttons that unlock it. Take the [GLOVE] and [POWERHT]. 
  Head down the southern passageway and ascend to the third floor.

 [THIRD FLOOR]

  One-way walk to the next stairway.

 [FOURTH FLOOR]

  Take the u-shaped path to the down-stairway you find.

 [THIRD FLOOR]

  Rob the chest of a [CURE] and take the up-stairway nearby.

 [FOURTH FLOOR]

  This leads to another up-stairway...

 [FIFTH FLOOR]

  There's a healing fountain on this floor, and enemies also appear, so you
  can campout here and grind for levels. Exit the room to the north and walk
  the magenta tiles to Zog. Obviously, he doesn't want to let you live 'n'
  stuff.

  o-----------o------------o----------o----------o
  | BOSS: Zog | HP: 10000? | EP: 7000 | GP: 7000 |
  o-----------o------------o----------o----------o

   This guy's tough, but with the DragonSH and the Rudra transformation, it
   becomes a whole lot easier. Still, everyone fighting should have over 150HP
   since the party-affecting skills can do about that -- this means that using
   Mogu is probably out of the question 'less you want a liability. Have Zack
   change into Rudra, Karn use the Puka simulation, Nina cast Deflect and heal
   allies, and Bleu use her strongest spell. Throw the D.Hrt at the dragon if
   you want to score 2000+ damage; this brings Zack's HP down to 1, however.
   If you want to be on the safe side, use an M.Drop -- everyone in your party
   should be faster than Zog...hopefully. >____>
   
   As for Zog's attacks, he has a weak hit-all breath attack...well, except
   for Puka who can take 200+ (!) damage from it. He also uses a physical hit
   which weakens a character by about 70~80dmg when it hits...although when I
   saw it, it was about a 50/50 chance of success or failure. Just heal up as
   necessary, using a second character with Meat/M. Drops if you are forced
   to. 

 After battle, Zog acknowledges your strength and explodes, sending you into
 the chasm far below. Instead of squashed tomatoes, everyone turns out A-OK!
 Sara is down here, and Zack gives her the keys so she can destroy 'em...only
 to have her trick the party and give them to Jade. ARRRGHHH! He says they're
 heading to Agua to release Tyr, so it's time to get on their trail. Everyone
 is cured, at least.

 Head south and a mole person will pop up. Jump in his hole, landing in a maze
 of sorts. There's a congregation of mole people -- talk to the one north of
 the Master Digger (yellow jumpsuit'd guy). When everyone jumps in the hole,
 follow 'em again to reappear in Scande proper, at a cavern with town access.
 Leave town and head for Agua. Remember where it is? No? It's the floating
 place by Romero.

o--------------------------------------o--------------------------------------o

 Since you've already been here, can lockpick your way up the floors instead
 of doing the puzzles, and the enemies suck, I'm not going to re-explain easy
 junk. By the fourth or so floor, you should be able to exit onto the tower's
 exterior and re-enter another point. From there, it's just a stairway to the
 towertop shrine.

 BEFORE you do anything, if you haven't already, search the two statues around
 here for the [LIFEAR] armor for Zack and the [ICYDR] for Karn. Enter the
 shrine to find Sara, who runs to a stairway. Follow her to find Jade, who
 raises a tower from an island nearby. Take the teleport device to...

o--------------------------------------o

 If you want to leave the Pagoda, just exit south to arrive on the world map.

 ---

 To begin with, there are five stairways here, but you can't go to all of 'em.
 Enter the northwest one by walking on the floor tile below a ledge, which
 raises a stairway.

[SECOND FLOOR]

 Get the nearby [POWERAR] chest and step on the tile near the stairway, which
 lowers a gate. Go south to the [DOMINO] chest and go down the stair whence
 you came. You'll have to use Exit to get out now, which is why this part was
 tackled first. =p  If you want to fly to the tower, head north-ish.

[FIRST FLOOR]

 Okay, you've re-entered the Pagoda. Go up the northeast mini-stairs, then
 arc south to get to the second floor.

[SECOND FLOOR]

 There are two holes nearby but they're red herrings -- don't bother. Head
 east across the skybridge and when you get to the purple-tiled floor, take
 the fork's north path to a [AGILEAR] -- a good armor for Bleu/Nina. Follow
 the other part of the fork to a down-stairway.

[FIRST FLOOR]

 Step on the floor-button to close the two gates nearby. Take the right newly-
 opened gate and when you get to the eastern wall, follow it north to a chest
 containing a [TRAPGRD]. Follow the wall south (don't step on gate switch)
 and follow west on the southern screen boundary. When you get to the far-west
 wall, take the alley beside it (right), which loops around to another switch.
 Step on it and continue north to the newly-opened gate, which contains a
 [FLAMEDR]. Take the stairs up.

[SECOND FLOOR]

 Follow the purple tiles to another stairway.

[THIRD FLOOR]

 The party's in a differently colored room, now. Walk up the stairs nearby
 and you'll be hit with a shield...but Sara regains her senses momentarily
 and breaks it for you, allowing you to proceed. The party took MAJOR damage
 from touching it, so heal up appropriately -- use a Cure2 or something to
 alleviate all that hurt, then go downstairs...but suddenly...

 o------------o------------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Sara | HP: ~11000 | EP: 8000 | GP: 8000 |
 o------------o------------o----------o----------o

  If you didn't listen to what I said, you'll enter battle with 1 HP. Heal
  up ASAP, with a Cure2 or M. Drop. Sara attacks for ~90dmg to one target or
  uses T. Bolt to deal ~50dmg to everyone. Needless to say, this battle is a
  piece of cake (or crap), and shouldn't pose a problem. Have Zack use Rudra,
  Karn use Puka, Nina heal, and Bleu use her strongest spells. You can even
  use the D.Hrt here for some damage, if you've saved it.

 Sara departs now that's she's free from Jade's control, so go downstairs.

[SECOND FLOOR]

 Follow the straightforward path to a healing fountain and, then, a stairway.

[FIRST FLOOR]

 You'll be at the two isolated stairs. Take the [STONEHT], then the other way.

[SECOND FLOOR]

 DO NOT fall down the hole; the area only looks small. You can actually follow
 the path east, under the "eaves" of the blind spot. It leads to a stairway.

[THIRD FLOOR]

 You'll now be in a "space zone," not unlike the one in Mare Tower. There are
 a bunch of annoying "disappear the path" buttons here, but if you follow the
 long, winding one (take south path from where you start), it eventually will
 lead to an upward stairway.

[FOURTH FLOOR?]

 Take the moving device north to find Jade taking Tyr's power. The screen goes
 black...

 Zack wakes up in Drogen and his party tells him Jade's made the Obelisk
 operational. On the world map, head south to the poisoned marsh and look for
 the giant purple lake. The Obelisk floats, and Nina can take the party in at
 once.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

o--------------------------------------o--------------------------------------o

 NOTE: Buying tons of Cures is a good idea from this point on, if you do not
       have CuraX! Also bring Acorns or other items that cure AP.

 ---

 Upon entering, open the door and have Mogu inspect the crack within. Since
 there is no entrance, he'll have to make one and, if you have the I.Claw,
 Mogu mentions learning how to use it. 

 If you do not have the I. Claw, see the "IWH1" section; if you do, fly to
 Gramor and talk to the elder with Mogu in the lead. It's only good for one
 use, but Mogu learns the "secret". Back in the Obelisk, inspect the crack
 with Mogu and he'll drill down into...

[FIRST FLOOR]

 You land by a teleportation device. There are two devices you can take on
 the northern side of the platform -- go for the easternmost. This takes you
 north to another platform with only one device in the west. It leads to a
 stairway.

[FLOOR B1]

 Take the north device to a platform with two moving devices. The northernmost
 is the one you want to take, and it leads to a one-way path to another device
 (yes, I know it's stupid to call everything a 'device'). You'll encounter a
 [FLAMEHR] chest naturally. There's also a big goon nearby, but you can't get
 to him from this position.

 Take the moving device (:p) to get back where you came in. Head north and
 this time, take the southern device on the second platform you come to.
 From there, it's a series of straightforward device-hopping to the goon. He
 runs away momentarily to the exit, so follow him.

[FLOOR B2]

 Take the moving platform north and a mummy-like thing comes out of the wall.
 Let's get it on, hombre!

 o------------o------------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Goda | HP: ~11000 | EP: 6000 | GP: 6000 |
 o------------o------------o----------o----------o

  This goofus only has one single-target physical attack, so there should be
  no problem making this guy come undone. I suggest just using Agni which'll
  do 999dmg to the boss consistantly. If you want to go the hard way/highroad,
  transform into the bolt dragon and attack, Karn can use Puka, Nina heals, 
  and Bleu uses whatever magicks she wants. But, really, Goda's pathetic no
  matter how you slice it.

 Goda asplodez and leaves a gaping hole in the wall; enter and go down the
 stairs you find.

[FLOOR B3]

 Four moving platforms you can take, and you can take either -- they all lead
 to the same room in the same position! Weird, I know. Luckily, this room is
 incredibly straightforward, with you either riding a platform or leaving one
 staircase to go up another...ad nauseum. Eventually, this takes you to the
 down-stairway in the middle of the room.

[FLOOR B4]

 Take the lone device west and go down the stairs -- don't bother with the
 other moving platforms, as they only lead to the stairs you left. Doesn't
 make sense, you say? Well, don't take 'em, like I said! =p

[FLOOR B5]

 Heal up Zack's AP and head north to meet swords with Jade. He asks if you
 want to switch sides, and no matter what you answer, he turns into one of
 those fat, mutated sweaty-blob monsters.

 o------------o------------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Jade | HP: ~23000 | EP: 8000 | GP: 8000 |
 o------------o------------o----------o----------o

  Transform into Agni to really murder this fool; or, do the usual if you do
  not have enough AP: Rudra/BltDgn + attack, Nina heals, Karn uses Puka, and
  Bleu slams things with her magick (Nova?). Jade attacks single target for
  mediocre, easily-removable damage (~80dmg) unless you're Puka, who can take
  up to 300+ (!); his attack-all spore attack does ~40 to everyone but Puka,
  who takes about ~150dmg. Again, not so incredibly hard, but it just takes
  awhile to chip away his inordinate amount of HP... Always keep your HP
  above 100 for the most part, since Blizzard does just that much to all the
  allies. There's nothing you can do about the T.Bolt spell if it hits a low-
  DEF character -- it did 279dmg to my Nina... Just revive and persevere as
  possible, which encapsulates what this entire battle is about. Note that
  once his HP is depleted the first time, his health bar disappears (only
  about 5000dmg left apx).

 Jade says it was destiny he would lose and blows up. Hah! Search his throne
 for a [EMPORSD] and search the right pillar for a [STARHR]. Anyway, if you
 need to level up or go do other stuff, Exit out and leave the elevator for
 awhile.

 Go below once you're ready and you'll find a girl past the first moving
 device. She heals everyone if you answer 'yes' to her. If you want to use
 this place as a level-up center, she will keep healing you so long as you
 don't give answer her with the negatory option (grinding in the poison marsh
 gives better EXP results however). Before you advance, here's what you need
 to have:

 - lots of Cures (x50 recommended0
 - a WtrJr' (heals all HP/MP - get in Ease Cave)
 - Acorns (only a few)

 If you've fought at the poisoned marsh as advised, you should be getting
 EXP/GP in the three-thousands. If you get Slimes and other crap, you're too
 far south (go north of Obelisk).

 To progress, though, you'll have to throw a big 'no' in her face. There are
 two ways this can go, each giving different endings.

 o---------------o------------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Goddess | HP: ~50000 | EP: 10   | GP: 12   |
 o---------------o------------o----------o----------o

  This boss is actually has two ways to go.

  [FIRST WAY:] - [Gives the bad ending]

   This is what happens if you don't have the Agni transformation for Zack.
   With the EmporSD and the Puka transformation as Karn, you should be hitting
   999dmg or thereabouts since the goddess' "crying little girl" form is
   pretty weak in terms of defense. She also won't attack for awhile. Once her
   HP bar's depleted, she'll ask you to be her friend -- choose "Yes" and Sara
   will tell you to use Agni, then the battle re-begins.

   The crying little girl now has a wild hair style, and will attack with some
   regular attacks and Blizzard (100dmg to all). Transform into Puka and Rudra
   and have Bleu use FireX. Nina heals, as per usual. Since Blizzard doesn't
   get used twice in a row (not that I could see, anyway), you should have a
   bit of time to heal up before the next slew of icicles. Everyone should be
   faster than the Goddess if your levels are in the mid-twenties/early 30s,
   so throwing a Cure item around isn't such a bad idea. You can use Nina's
   Shield spell to halve damage from Blizzard, if you didn't know (it wears
   off in three turns or so).

   [ENDING:]

    SPOILERS AHEAD:

    .

    .

    Sara shows up and everyone and reminds everyone that they should continue
    to be 'heroes' and help with the rebuilding of the world. Everyone agrees
    and...cut to credits! Afterwards, Tyr is shown in the Obelisk saying "I
    haven't done anything wrong, don't hurt me" before turning into an evil
    portrait of herself. Y'know, the one with the Dragon Ball Z hair. >=p

    THE END!

 o---------------o------------o----------o----------o
 | BOSS: Goddess | HP: ~50000 | EP: 10   | GP: 12   |
 o---------------o------------o----------o----------o

  [SECOND WAY:] - [Gives the better ending]

  Transform into Agni and attack the Goddess, halting the battle for only a
  moment. Instead of the "little girl," you'll fight her true form, a giant
  multi-snaked demonic thinger. Change back into Agni (feed Zack a Acorn if
  you need to) and start attacking. You'll be doing 999 damage each time and
  shouldn't have any problem with this, provided you have some Cures in the
  inventory to heal up. This way's actually a bit simpler than the previous.
  BigCrash should be doing ~70dmg, and unless you have CuraX, Agni is the way
  to fight this (cheap? yes). Just heal up when your HP is around 150-200,
  since the Goddess will always get the first turn. You know how to anticipate
  healing...

   [ENDING:]

    SPOILERS AHEAD:

    .

    .

    Tyr curses the party and disappears, and the party falls out of the tower
    (which is collapsing) only to be saved by Nina's power of flight. Back by
    Winlan, Sara's spirit commends the party for defeating the Goddess of
    Destruction and says they're truly the legendary heroes. Zack says his
    only line in the game ("Wait!") and the dragon lord appears, reminding the
    party to rebuild the world in the war's end. Karn whines about taking a
    break, but Bo says a hero's work is never done. Gobi reminds the party he
    is still do his payment. When a Winlan soldier asks Nina to return to the
    castle, she says there's work to be done -- subsequently, she flies all
    around the world before a montage of the party leaving plays:

    1) In Gramor watching Master Digger/Mogu spin around
    2) The party walking single-file in the desert
    3) Ox and his wife watching their newborn child
    4) Gobi swimming as Big Fish back to Prima
    5) Karn entering Bleak
    6) Bo returning to Tantar
    7) Nina and her father hugging before Zack leaves (she waves ^^)
    
    Finally, an old lady involved in the rebuilding of Drogen sees Zack coming
    back with the sunset as a backdrop. Sara's picture appears over the sun,
    signifying the end of the game. The credits this time have pictures of the
    enemies, compared to the "bad" ending's which had a dragon lord pic. At
    the end, there's a pic of Nina and Zack with "THE END" and an evil Zack
    pic that says "To be continued..."

| V. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                                        [FAQZ] |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 [Q] - How come I can't used Agni?
 [A] - You need to merge with all the characters, so this means that Karn must
       be de-fused with other people. It should work fine, then.

 [Q] - How do I get some W. Ants?
 [A] - Kill the rare white stag on the world map with Bow; or, alternatively,
       look in the "CRM4" section for a location list.

 [Q] - Hey, [something or the other] is out of order! What gives!?
 [A] - Chillax, I haven't played for awhile. Send in a correction and I'll
       update. =p

 [Q] - You forgot [so-and-so]!
 [A] - Send me the correction and I'll update, although you'll have to provide
       the earliest time you can do/find the "something."

 [Q] - Do you like this game a lot?
 [A] - Not really... >______>
