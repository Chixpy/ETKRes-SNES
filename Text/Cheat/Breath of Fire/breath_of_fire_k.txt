| Introduction                                                    | IDXA001 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Welcome to my guide to BOF1. I'm pretty much aware of the fact that BOF1 is
an old game, and that it also lacks a few things which should be in an RPG
game by rule in RPG standards of today. Nevertheless BOF1 is truely a classic
every RPG player should have played.

The usage of this FAQ is easy. Since I believe using Walktroughs is no fun, I
try to write ALL my walkthroughs so that you only have to read them on moments
you're absolutely stuck. Just look up the passage you're stuck in the index
then press Ctrl-F (Apple-F when you are on Mac) type over the code behind it
press enter and the brower will look the section up for you. (If you don't get
the right section, which is possible do it again, and you should be right now).

When you must know. A rule in RPG standards today is not to make the player
look up the entire worldmap to find a clue to go on. BOF1 was produced before
this rule was taken up in the standards, so being stuck forever is pretty
easy here since it could be you missed something. You can always go back for
it, that's not the problem, but where to look. Therefore, at the start of
each section I'll note which section you must have done before you can take on
this section, so you can easily spot what you got to do. The IDX codes will
be noted also, so you don't have to look through the entire FAQ.

In every dungeon I'll use "-", "#"  and "=". When I start a line with "-" it
means you entered a new area within this dungeon. When you have multiple
things to do in the dungeon I'll split all actions up with a "=" marker so
you can do all things one by one.
The "#" is practically the same as "-" with only one small diffrence.
Once you got Bleu in your party you'll gain the spell "Exit" which you can
use to warp out of a dungeon. At the end of nearly every mission you can
use that spell to get out. When I place a "#" in stead of a "-" it means
this is a part of the FAQ you can skip if you decide to use Exit.

What the fuck is "GUTS"?
I named if after the "GUTS" message that shows up in BOF3 when your party
members automaticly revive by willpower when they are slain. Here I use it
to name the system of the secret HP bar of bosses. Most bosses start with
two HP bars. One you can track, and one you can not. When you've beaten the
visible HP bar out the Boss will enter what I call the "GUTS"-mode and then
you have to beat the second HP bar out which the game won't show.

The numbers behind party member names that I note are the levels I had when
I wrote this FAQ at that sections. Are they recommendations? No! I never
level up, as I deem it a waste of time and a way of cheating. I noted those
levels for inexperienced RPG players, so that they have a good view of the
levels I had so they can compare their way of playing to mine. I do recommend
inexperienced players to have higher levels than I have. Experience players
should ignore the fact that the levels are printed in this FAQ in the first
place.
Sometimes I noted an "F" behind the level numbers. That has to do with Karn.
Karn can fuse with other party members. Party members I marked with an "F"
were in my party fused with Karn at the time.

Then, please note that I wrote this FAQ for the US version of BOF1. So I use
all the US names of stuff. Please keep that in mind in case you are playing
the Japanse version of the game.

Furthermore I wrote this FAQ playing the SNES version of BOF1. I do have
the cartridge for the GBA, and as far as I played that version it's exactly
the same except for a few cosmetic changes, but since I never finished that
version I cannot make guarantees. If you find any things in the GBA version
that are significantly diffrent, please notify me and I may note it in this
FAQ and credit you for your trouble.

Having said that all, enjoy the game!

| Game over? Or Not?                                              | IDXB002 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
What is handy to know here is that the only way the game can be over is by
defeating the final boss and not by any other way.

Hey Trick, the game will be over when the enemies kill me just as in any
other RPG!

I beg your pardon, but that's NOT the case. When the enemies beat you the game
is not over. Not in a random encounter and not in a boss fight either. You'll
be transported back to the last savespot you used to save the game. This is
not an auto-reload of the last savegame, as some RPG games do, but really a
transport. Nearly all things you've done till you got yourself killed will
NOT have to be re-done. There's no limit in how many times you can die, you'll
always be back at the last savespot.

When the last savespot is unavailable the computer will pick a new savespot
to teleport you to. Mostly the closest in the area you are in.

There is however a penalty to this and one that can really hurt if you don't
pay attention to that. The total ammount of money you got in cash will be
halved. The money you deposit at a bank will NOT be halved. Therefore it can
be recommended that before you take on a hard mission (or a mission you are
not really sure about) to deposit all your money at a bank and withdraw it
from the bank when you plan to go shopping again.

Whenver you get warped to the latest savespot because you lost a battle your
HP and MP will be restored, and aside from the money you lose there are no
more futher penalties.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Karn's Fusion Spells                                            | IDXB003 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Fusion is a very interesting ability of Karn's. Karn fuses with two ore more
party members (which is either Bo, Ox or Gobi) to become a super being.

The best part of this ability is that Karn doesn't turn back into a human
after battle like Ryu does when he becomes a dragon. Karn does turn back into
human form when important parts of the scenario take place.
You can rest with Karn in fused form and he won't unfuse.
You cannot trade weapons with Karn in fused form. For that you really got
to unfuse first.

Here are the spells Karn can learn.

+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| Shin                      | Karn + Gobi + Bo                   | AP 10   |
+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
Shin is the best. You fuse with the two most worthless party members in your
team (not counting Mogu) and you get a very good form back for it.

Also good to know is that Karn can hunt in this form like Bo, but he can
shoot faster and his range is longer, so hunting works much better with Karn
as Shin.

Shin is also able to walk through forests like Bo.

To obtain this form you must have Ox in your party and go to Gant.
Go to the house in the back of town and go to the room where you got the
Goods before. Push the cabinet aside and go through the way that is created
Have Ox to remove the rocks then Karn to speak with the strange man.
Voila!

+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| Debo                      | Karn + Ox + Gobi                   | AP 15   |
+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
I found Debo absolutely useless. You can only use it underwater. Point is
that on the moment you acquire it, the chance that you get any more underwater
battles is nada, unless you really want to seek them out, can't think of any
reason to, actually.

To obtain Debo go to Gust. Second house on the west. Push some crates to fall
into a pit. You'll find barrels to push like this
  A B C
1 * * *
2 *   *
3   *
= Push B3 to either east or west
= Push A2 west. C2 East
= Push A1 and C1 north
= Bush B1 either east or west
Now you can access the spirit to get the spell



+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| Doof                      | Karn + Ox + Bo                     | AP 25   |
+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
Personally I never use Doof. If you find some use for it, be my guest.
Doof can however be used to move heavy objects to obtain bonusses

To obtain Doof you must have Mogu to dig at a spot close to were Nanai used
to be. There you find the man who can teach you the spell (Karn may not be
fused at the time)

+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| Puka                      | Karn + Ox + Bo + Gobi              | AP 40   |
+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+
Puka is among most fans (not among me though) the favorite fusion for Karn.
I suppose he is strong, but I personally don't like to sacrifice Ox since
I use him a lot since his defense is high. Saves magic.

Anyway to obtain Puka you must have the Doof spells first. Then go to Bleak
and go to the house of that girl who pretents to be a fortune teller.
Go to the back of the house and have Karn (if Doof form) to push the cabinet
and you'll fall into a pit. Unfuse Karn and speak to the man to obtain Puka.

| Walkthrough                                                     | IDXC000 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
You start the game with Ryu in Drogen.
Good luck.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Drogen                                                          | IDXC001 |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ryu 01                                                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- You'll be in bed when the game starts and an old lady will wake you up while
  your house is on fire.
  Follow the lady. Don't worry about the flames blocking your way, the lady
  will use magic to put them out.
  Follow her down the stairs

- Go to the doorway on the sourth. There are four people there.
  Talk to the blue haired girl on the left and she'll move.
  Talk to the other blue haired girl.
  Now a sequence will start in which Sara will act. After this is all over
  the game will truely begin.
  Talk to the chief. Open the chest to get 300GP.
  Exit south.

- Now you are in the city square of Drogen. You can buy stuff at the shops
  here, and I do recommend to buy some herbs and antidotes here. If you're
  out of money you can leave town to fight monsters to earn cash.
  The dragon temple can be used to save the game (they are in nearly all
  towns, so I won't say it all the time). When you're done leave town to
  go to the next town.

(Don't waste your time and money on buying weapons and armor. They are way too
expensive at this point, and you'll get all equipment you need for free in
the first dungeon. Of course, going for weapons later is a good idea).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Camlon                                                          | IDXC002 |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Just like Drogen, this city is ruined.
- Go north and enter the castle.

- = Head north
  = Around the corner west
  = ARound the corner north
  = Around the corner east (you can drink at the fountain to restore all
    your HP and MP).
  = At the end north
  = Around the corner east
  = First way south
  = At the end east (another fountain where you can drink to restore your HP)
  = Around the corner south
  = First way east, and then immediatly north
  = Go downstairs at the end

- Follow the corridor and exit upstairs at the end.
  (You can take the treasure of you want).

- Head south and exit downstairs at the end

- Follow the corridor and exit upstairs at the end.
  (You can take the treasure of you want).

- = Go south
  = At the end west
  = First way north
  = Around the corner north
  = Go west at the end
  = Exit upstairs
  (The chests here are trapped)

- Go to the frog on the throne and it'll attack you.

| Ryu 04                                                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Preperations: Bring a lot of herbs                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Most of the attacks of the Frog are about 7 or 8 HP. It is faster than    |
| you, so basically, you should attack it all the time and heal when your   |
| HP is getting lower than 20, using an Herb.                               |
| The Frog has a GUTS-mode, but it has so little HP in that mode that you   |
| can forget about that little detail.                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this battle you can claim the treasures in the chests here, if you want
and head out of the castle the same way you came. There are no more random
encounters here any more, so don't you worry about that.

After you leave this area your next target is the city of Nanai.


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Very important is that you know that BOF1 has a diffrence between night and
day. Entering Nanai by day won't make much sense, the guards simply won't
let you in, and there's no way to fight them. When it's day, simply wait at
the worldmap till its gets dark and enter the city again. Now the guard at
the entrance should be sleeping and you can enter.

Now be very very careful. Most other guards are not sleeping and if such a
guard sees you you'll be kicked out of town, and you gotta start all over
again.

(The weapon shop in the east of town is still open for business, but the
stuff they sell is either worthless in this stage of the game, or you already
got it, or way too expensive).

- = From the sleeping guard head north (save your game at the temple if you
    want). Don't get too close to the guard, or you'll be kicked out of town.
  = Head west
  = At the end go northfirst way east
  = First way north
  = At the end east
  = At the end south
  = Keep going south (if you pass the pillars in the middle you'll be too
    far away for the guards to see).
  = At the very end east
  = First way south
  = East past the sleeping guard
  = First way north (don't get too close to the guard)
  = Enter the large building

Phew.... made it.... But now the a dungeon is about to start, so be right to
fight.

- Open the gate and exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs (again)

- Welcome inside a volcano (or so it looks at least)
  = Go south down the ramp
  = Go south down the other ramp
  = Go south and cross the bridge
  = At the end of the bridge go east
  = Go north up the two ramps
  = Cross the bridge to the east
  = Cross the bridge to the north
  = Go down the stairs

- Exit downstairs

- = Go down the two ramps south
  = Cross the bridge south
  = At the end take the ramp up at the eastside
  = Cross the bridge south
  = Go all the way east till you can go no further
  = Cross the bridge to the north
  = Go down the ramp on the westside
  = Go up the other ramp on the westside
  = Exit downstairs

- = Go into the north corridor
  = Go to the knight talk to him and kill him.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This knight is pretty fast and his attacks are around 12 or so. Not to    |
| mention his ThunderBolt attack which does around 20 damage. So you do     |
| understand that you gotta heal as soon as you HP are getting close to     |
| that ammount. When his HP is getting low, things can start to become      |
| irritating cause he starts to heal. His healing spell is stronger than    |
| your attacks and he keeps doing that, so in theory this fight would last  |
| forever, HOWEVER his MP will run out, and once he's run out of MP he can  |
| no longer heal. That's the time to finish him off.                        |
|                                                                           |
| This fight WILL be very demanding on your Herbs so carry as much as you   |
| can afford at the time.                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  = Examine the strange stone device and take the key
  = The pad on the east started to glow, step on it to complete this mission.

You'll be back in Camlon. If you leave Camlon and go past where Nanai used to
be you'll get to Winlan. Your next target.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Head straight north for the castle.
In there speak to the queen. She'll offer you a room to sleep.
Ryu will accept.

While Ryu is sleeping Nina will take over the game. (She starts the game at
level 5). Leave her bedroom and go downstairs. And leave the castle.

Be sure to buy at the stores what you need and leave the city of Winlan.

Nina may on her own have a hard time beating  the creatures on the worldmap,
so head straight to the cave west of here. (There are some she can beat, but
best is to take no chances).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- Immediatly when you go north you'll meet two soldiers who won't allow you
  into the cave unless you allow them to join the party. (The reason I didn't
  note those two soldiers in the character section is because they are only
  on this section, and the game makers didn't even bother to give them a
  name. They are not really special, but they come in handy, since Nina would
  never make it on her own).
  = Go north
  = Go up the ramp
  = Go downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- In this room you can find the I-Ore. Be sure not to continue the game
  without it, as you need it later in the game. (Read on to find out how
  to get it).
  = Go down the ramp south
  = Head east and follow the road
  = At the fork (after passing a treasure chest) go north
  = First way west
  = Open the chest to get the I-Ore.
  = Go back east and take the first way south
  = First way west
  = Go back to the stairs
  = If you came back here to claim the I-Ore only you can make your way out
    of the cave. When you are here on Nina's quest to get a cure for the
    king, ignore the stairs and head north in stead.
  = Cross the bridge to the north
  = At the end go east
  = Cross the bridge to the east
  = Cross the bridge to the north
  = At the end west
  = Go down the ramp and keep going west
  = Go to the stairs and exit upstairs

- Go north and take the stairs up

- Exit south

You'll be on the worldmap. West is the city of Romero. Right now you can only
pass through it on your way to the forest west of it. (Romero will be
important later in the game, of course you can stock up some goods if you
need). The forest to the west of this town is your next target.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
I hate  this forest, so don't blame me for any possible irrelevant detours.
I gotta search myself every time I play this (which must be over 80 times by
now).

- = Go west
  = First way South
  = At the end west
  = First way north, and first way west
  = At the end south and immediatly west
  = Exit west to leave the forest

Straight to the west is the white tower, I believe to be Karma (The game is
pretty vague in the names of dungeons).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Karma is a dungeon that requires good preperations. There are two pretty
deadly bosses here, and no resting points. Despite the fact that Nina is a
white mage, having a lot of Herbs is recommended. If you have acorns things
are even better since you can use them to recover used MP, and the chance is
great that Nina will need that.

- = Go north
  = First way east (You can use the fountain to recover)
  = Go to the Grim Reaper figure and kill it.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Morte's attacks can do around 16 points damage, which can be pretty much  |
| of a problem for Nina in particular. Most of the turns Nina will have to  |
| heal people up (mostly herself) while the Soldiers do the attacking.      |
| You can reduce the damage a little by casting Fort over your party. You   |
| do not really have to be cheap on using MP since you are close to a       |
| healing fountain. Take advantage of that situation.                       |
|                                                                           |
| Once Morte went into the GUTS mode his attacks will be stronger, however  |
| it will only take 1 or 2 turns to finish him off, so it won't be too much |
| danger after all.                                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  The stairs you see are the exit to take, but you may want to drink at the
  fountain first. :)

- = Go to the outern ring corridor and take the northern way west there
  = Follow the road and take the first stairs up you see

- = Go north
  = At the end go east
  = Follow the corridor
  = Take the stairs down

- = Follow the corridor to the north.
  = Jump into the right hole in the floor

- Go upstairs

- = Head south
  = Take the stairs up at the end

- Go south to the reaper figure and kill it.

| Mortea doesn't like to play games. Mortea is a lot stronger than Morte    |
| and attacks of 20 are regular, but 30+ is no exception here. Not to       |
| mention that Mortea is very fast. The fact that Nina is always the        |
| fastest when performing a healing spell is your only trumpcard here, so   |
| make use of that.                                                         |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| All party members are reduced to 1 HP, and Nina is also reduced to 1 MP   |
| at the start of this battle. You cannot win this battle. The wizard has   |
| infinite HP. Don't waste your healing items and stuff on this fight,      |
| because you are not supposed to win. After a few turns this fight will    |
| be broken off. Soldier2 will leave the arena to get some help, while Nina |
| and Soldier1 will contine the fight. Just allow the wizard to kill you    |
| the story will continue.                                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now the game will carry over the controls back to Ryu. A soldier will ask
you if you want to save Nina. Accept this request. Now before you leave
Winlan you may want to buy some items because (as you may have guessed) Ryu
will have to deal with the wizard now (and he has to fight alone).
When you are ready leave Winlan and talk to the guard with the orange wings.
He'll bring you to Karma so that Ryu can continue Nina's quest.
(Soldier3 will join you for a very short while).

- Exit downstairs

- You can save at the dragon statue and use the fountain to recover.
  Exit downstairs

- Go west and exit downstairs

- Go east and exit downstairs

- Follow the corridor and exit downstairs (Soldier3 will stay behind)

- = South
  = At the end west
  = First way north
    (HINT! You can take the second way north to get a Rang. A weapons for
    Ryu with good ATK and allows Ryu to attack all enemies in once).
  = Go to the Wizard and kill that $@*$#)@*$

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The Wizard is very annoying. His spells can deal around 15 damage         |
| so you must be alert. His Petrify move allows him to dodge your attacks   |
| which is truely annoying. Doesn't always work though but most often it    |
| it does. Just attack and heal in time is the recipe to victory.           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight you'll get the Remedy. The cure for the ill king.
The mission will be over and you'll automaticly get back to Winlan Castle.

Go there upstairs to the King's bedroom and speak to Nina. The King will be
cured and you'll get permission to use the eastern tunnel. Nina will also
insist in joining you on your quest, so Ryu and Nina will from now on travel
together.

You can leave Winlan through the east tunnelm which you can enter by going
downstairs on the ground floor of the castle. Go past the guards and leave
to the east, then head for Tantar.

(Don't bother claiming the treasures in the tunnel. You can't. You'll have
to come back for those once Karn joined the party).

| When you left Winlan through the east tunnel and bridge follow the road   |
| to the south. When you get to a T-cross with one path leading into the    |
| forest, take the path south (so NOT into the forest). Whe the path stops  |
| continue going south, and head east at the end.                           |
| Follow the shores and you'll see a dried up river. Follow the shores of   |
| that river and you see two cities. Tantar to the left and Tuntar to the   |
| right. It's Tantar we're going to, so the city on the left.               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
In the purple house south of town lives a blacksmith. Give him the I-Ore.
(If you missed it, you can find it in the cave beside Winlan, read that
section for it). Now he'll make a saw for you.
With that saw you're done here and you can leave for the forest to get onto
your new quest.

If you got the Saw from Tantar, Ryu will automaticly cut the tree blocking
your way in. And so you can enter. (However Ryu will break the saw in the
process).

- = North

- Be warned about one thing. This dungeon is filled with trapholes you can
  fall in! :(
  = Kill the guards at the entrance.
  = Go immediatly east
  = At the end north
  = Follow the corridor
    (I know there was a shorter way, but you'll fall into a trap hole if you
    try that one).
  = Forget the treasure chests (traphole) and go north
  = When you see the guards go to them and kill them
  = From there go west and exit downstairs

- = Go east
  = second way north
  = Follow the corridor
  = At the end of this corridor go west
  = Go to the three guards and kill them
  After this fight the Chief of Tuntar will speak to you and suggest to
  take the weapons of the enemy before leaving. Accept his suggestion.
  This will lead into a boss fight.

| Pog is two-headed, and the red head stands for fire, and the blue for ice |
| not that the elements had much meaning back in BOF1, but it's still a     |
| nice detail. The attacks of Pog are overall not strong, and when you      |
| decided to cast Fort, the attacks will be even weaker. Pog is able to     |
| attack both party members in one turn. Basically Ryu should do the attack |
| and Nina the healing. Since you had some strong monsters to get here and  |
| this fight can be demanding on Nina's MP, some acorns are a good idea to  |
| have here.                                                                |

| This fight is pretty semiliar as the one you did against the knight. But  |
| now you got three party members in stead of only one. His attacks are     |
| very strong and Nina will be healing contineously. Bo can kill him in     |
| only three turns if you let him cast "Fry" all the time. This will        |
| require the usage of an acorn though since he doesn't have enough magic   |

  = Go south from there
  = Head east

From here I suggest to go to Tantar first in order to rest at the Inn and
save the game at the Dragon Shrine. If you'd talk to the chief of Tuntar
(the village on the right), he'll tell you the secret of the stone robot is
in Agua. That's the next target but before you can go there you'll have to
do the Zombie Quest

+--------- NOTE ------------------------------------------------------------+
| Now that you have Bo you can start hunting the animals that roam the      |
| world map. With Bo in the lead you can shoot them. Whenever you see a     |
| white stag. HUNT IT! You'll obtain a White Antler if you succeed which    |
| you need later in the game.                                               |

| Now that you have Bo in your party, you can do things a little bit faster |

| From this bridge go north, and go west as soon as you reach the water.    |

| Ignore the cave and keep going west and you'll see Romero.                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When it's day you can ask around people and they'll be talking about how the
city has problems with Zombies. At day the city is safe, but at night the
city is swamped with Zombies. If you speak to the mayor he'll only be willing
to help when you rid the city of the Zombies.
When it's day there's nothing to do but to leave town and to wait for
nightfall.

At night the city is swamped with zombies, but don't you worry. They will not
harm you. When you speak to the old lady at the graveyard her zombie husband
will open a passage. If that doesn't happen hear towns people in the houses
out until one tells you of the water jar and try it again.

Go into that passage and get the Water Jar from the chest to the north.
Go south and up the stairs to get back on the world map and to go to the
cave to the west.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Remeber the General you fought on the moment Bo joined the party? This    |
| one is exactly the same. The lancers who are in this fight are also the   |
| same as the ones you fought in the very same dungeon. So basically        |
| nothing new here. I had Ryu equipped with the Rang at the time and that   |
| made this fight easy for me. I used Bo to cast Fry twice on the General   |
| make him go in GUTS-mode (when this happens all further attacks are       |
| cancelled. This goes for all bosses by the way). And one attack from Ryu  |
| could hurt all enemies, so I was rid of the lancers pretty quickly.       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  = After the fight examine the plate and the Robot will get active
  = Now go north and step on the teleporter pad (west of the stairs)

- Examine the device to get the robot on the move.

Now a sequence will start (which was quite impressive for a game of that time)
in which the robot will destroy the barrier that keeps the water out of Tuntar
and Tantar. Your mission here has ended (for now).

  Step on the teleporter

- Go north and exit downstairs

- Go west and exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- Exit south

Now go back to Tantar (south left of the river).
Talk to the chief here and he'll give you access to a key you need for the
next mission.

  = At the end take the stairs down and go west
  = Take the other stairs up and go west
  = Take the other stairs down and go west

You'll be back on the worldmap, but the mission doesn't end here.
You see another cave to the north-west. Enter it.

- = Go north
  = Unlock the door (you need the key from the Chief of Tantar for this)
  = Exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs (yes, again)

  = Go south, first way west
  = Take the stairs south into the water
  = Go south and drop off the waterfall
  = Go south
  = Around the corner east
  = Second stairs north (The first has a SkyShield. Good to give Nina more
    defense).
  = Open the blue chest to obtain the keyitem "ring".

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Upon your arrival speak to the people at the entrance and they'll make way.
Go to the chief's house. Speak to one of the chief's there and the wedding
will take place.
Now you can leave the city.

Now you'll see that somebody has taken over the robot, will cause a disaster
with that. So get into the robot and kick that @$*@)$#* out of it.

NOTICE!
The boss in this mission is the hardest of the game. Be sure you are
well-prepared. Carrying as much meat as possible is a very good idea.
(You can get meat by hunting boars on the world map).

The way through the robot is exactly the same as before in section IDXC00D,
so I refer to that section of that. So let's get on with the boss, shall we.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Ryu 13                 | Nina 12                 | Bo 12                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The start of this battle ain't that hard. This guy does a lot of damage   |
| though. It can also strike all party members in once. Especially Bo shows |
| himself incredibly weak here.                                             |
|                                                                           |
| Once the GUTS-mode has started things will get really hard.               |
| Then the Gremlin will only use his all attack, and because of that you    |
| may be doing more healing than actual fighting. If you got some Meat you  |
| can use that when the situation gets critical (and it will). If Nina has  |
| cast "Fort" on everybody at the start of this battle good. It won't be    |
| key to victory but it helps a lot.                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this battle is over, you can rest assured that the hardest part of BOF1
is over. Even the final boss is not this hard (on the other hand, compared
to the final boss here, any other boss is hard).

This is the first Dragon Challenge Shrine out of 3.
This is the place where you can earn your first dragon transformations for
Ryu.

I'll hereby note that these shrines are NOT optional. You have to complete
them all in order to earn the ultimate form Agni, and without Agni beating
the final boss is impossible.
But that comes much later, let's concentrate on this shrine first, shall we?

Enter the shrine and talk to the guardian. He'll only allow Ryu to pass.

Then talk to the dragon spirit and he'll have you to beat Talon.

| Boss 10 \

| Talon                                                    | GUTS: NO       |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The point is that Ryu has to fight Talon alone.                           |
| Talon has very much HP which makes this battle rather boring.             |
| He is also a lot faster than you.                                         |
| His attacks are mostly 15+, but he can do a "Slam" attack which can       |
| really hurt you. (35+ damage)                                             |
|                                                                           |
| Best is to use normal attacks, and start using healing stuff whenever     |
| Ryu's HP bar turns orange. Herbs can do a fine job in this. Bringing a    |
| few cures is also a wise thing.                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When you win this fight you'll get the SnoDr (Snow Dragon), FlmDr (Flame
Dragon), and the ThrDr (Thunder Dragon). Using these dragon forms can really
make your next boss battles a lot easier.

Now your challenge has been completed and you can talk to the guard to get
out. On to the next mission.

Immediatly when you arrive here you'll be arrested and thrown in jail.
Not to worry. You see the sleeping man. That is Karn. He won't join the party
yet though, but when you wake him up he'll open the cell door for you. (Oddly
he goes back to sleep after that). Now you can leave jail. Be warned though,
there's still a guard and when you get too close you'll be kicked into jail
again. The way to get out is still the same then.

Now what you must do here, is buying a Gold Bar at the Manillo shop, however
that thing is extremely expensive. 65000 Gold. It's very unlikely you got
that in cash. You can (of course) hit the fields to hunt mosters to earn
enough cash (and earn some EXP in the process), but that will take very
extremely long. I don't think you want to take that long.

You can start selling weapons you no longer need. That won't be enough though.
Then it comes. All citizens in Auria are rich. Very extremely rich.
(Bill Gates, eat your heart out). And that makes that they have the ability
to reward you generously for any kind of services you do for them. Let's
take those out.

On the upperfloor of the shop is a bar. There's a customer who has a very
bad case of hiccups. If you buy Vitamn at the shop of 650 gold and give it
to him you'll receive 5000 gold. That works wonders doesn't it?

In the 1st house on the left you can find a W-Ant (White Antler) in a chest
upstairs. Take it. You you need it much later in the game and you can't win
the game without it.

In the second house on the left is a woman. Speak to her and she'll tell you
her son is missing. If you leave Auria go back through the cave and go "ring"
east of the forest you can find him. Speak to him and go to the forest and
go to the clearing. Speak to the fairies. They should dispell the spell on
him. This does not always work. If it doesn't return to Auria (use Warp if
Nina is level 13 or higher) and try it again. When the fairies agree to
dispell the curse speak to the guy again, then return to Aria to report to
his mother and receive your reward. (20000 gold pieces in cash).

In the second house on the right, there's a man who wishes to speak with
Nina. If you allow her to fix his back, you'll get yourself another 200000
gold pieces. I must note not to open the chest on the ground floor in this
house. The owner will yell "THIEF THIEF" and you'll get yourself in jail
(Karn can get you out again, so no problem after all).

This is all the money you can earn with services, but it did help a lot to
shorten the time collecting money, didn't it?

A few hints.
= Do not rest in Auria. If Nina has Warp (she should by now). Warp to another
  town and rest there.
= Also watch out. If you did already get in Bleak, don't rest there without
  bringing all your cash to the bank first.
= If you go out to earn money by beating monsters, bring your money to the
  bank first. After all if you lose your cash is halved and that penalty is
  very heavy at this moment.
  The only cities available with a bank yet are Winlan, Romero and (if you
  already made your way there) Bleak.
= It makes no sense to hunt for monsters near Auria. What they give is
  too little to notice. Try the area around Tantar or the forest around Karma


When you got the Gold Bar, go to the Pier to the west of town and talk to
the sailor. He'll tell you the ship belongs to Ross.
Now go to the big house at the north of town.
Talk to Ross (the guy walking around in the house) and he requests your help.
Say "Yes". He wants you to save his daughter.
Too bad there's nothing you can do for her now, but you must have heard this
before you can go on to Bleak, your next target.

Now you can leave and head for the cave to the east.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cave between Auria and Bleak                                    | IDXC00K |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
NOTICE!
If you encounter monsters named "Bully". Run away. When they come with their
version of thunderbolt you're history. (Of course you're warped back to the
latest savespot, but it's frustrating when you got to do things over again
and again).

- = Talk to the guys at the entrance and they'll make way. If they don't you
    first got to speak to Ross about his daughter first.
  = Exit downstairs.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Nearly all citizens of Bleak are thieves. Because of this you can better
trust nobody. The store and the bank are the only places here where you can
find people you can trust.

Even the innkeeper cannot be trusted. He claims to give you free lodgings,
but when you wake up and check your money you'll see that 1000 gold pieces
have been stolen. (That's also a way to stay in business I suppose). Of
course, you can drop all your money at the bank before you use the inn and
that makes the innkeeper not happy, but now you have rested for free... >:)
(You can try that again and again, and he'll fall for that again and again).

When you go to the house in the north of town and speak to the old man nhe'll
tell you that Karn can help you, but that he is in the Krypt. You need the
Icicle to get there and you can only get that if you give him your gold bar
(that greedy old $@&@)$#(*&@)

With the Icicle you got all you need from Bleak and you can move on to the
cave west of Bleak to get into the desert.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cave to the desert                                              | IDXC00M |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- Exit downstairs

- = Go west
  = Follow the corridor
  = Exit Upstairs

- = Go west
  = Follow the corridor
  = Exit south (this is impossible if you don't have the icicle from Bleak)

You'll be in the desert. Your next target is the village of Arad.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Arad is hard to spot as it lies in the middle of the desert. Search the   |
| southern area of the desert. If you see a moving city you're close. If    |
| you see a temple with some sandwhirls around it, then head a little to    |
| the north. That's all I can hint for to spot Arad.                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The tent south-east is an Inn. It's free so use that :)
The dragon statue is also located there.

Now go to the red tent in the north of town and speak to the village chief.
He'll make a proposal. Accept it. You'll have an automated rest after that
go to the north-east of town and kill the sandworm

| This fight is not that hard, but the SandWorm has a few nasty attacks.    |
| This is also the first boss in which we can put Ryu's ability to turn     |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight you get the thanks of the chief. You can now open the chest
in the back of his tent to get the Fife which you need to get into Krypt.

Now you can go to Krypt.

- You can claim all treasures. When you open the blue chest a trap will
  trigger and the room will be flooded with water. However, Karn will come
  to your aid and deactivate this trap and join the party.

- Go south, have Karn to open the door, and get outta here.

The most logical action would seem to be warping to Auria, but I recommend
against it. There are two more things to do between Bleak and Auria.
Therefore I recommend to warp to Bleak in stead and go to the tower near
Bleak first.

Pretty soon you're gonna need another gold bar. Of course you can decide to
hunt monsters to earn enough money to buy one, but I suppose that's not the
way you wanna go, if you know you can get one for free here.

You do need Karn in your party for this.

This cave has two entrances. In this FAQ I assume that you entered this
cave from the east side (that is from Bleak).

- = North
  = Second way west
  = Have Karn to open the door
  = Open the chest to obtain the gold bar

  If you have the mirror you'll automaticly show it making an image of
  his wife. If you don't have the mirror, get it first from the Tower near
  Bleak. After that go back into the cellar.

  Exit downstairs (and make your whole way back to the cellar)

First of all accept Gobi's offer for gills (even though you cannot pay the
price he asks). After that Gobi will take over the game alone.

Since Gobi is a Manillo, otherwise known as fish-man he's able to breath
underwater. So head south from the beach and enter the sea.

Once underwater I gotta say this. Gobi is no match at all for the creatures
of the sea. So whenever you get into a battle, run away, since there's no
way to win (unless Lady Luck has really hopelessly fallen in love with you).
Of course if you lose you'll be transported to the dragon shrine in Prima,
which is the city you got to be. (Cash is halved still)

To do this without being slain:
From the place where you got into the sea, head west and you'll see the city
of Prima.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Prima                                                           | IDXC00V |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Requirements: -                                                           |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Manillos are business man by nature, so it was to be expected that their city
is swamped with shops, and some sell truely good stuff, but I suggest to wait
until you are able to bring the rest of your party here. Go to the chief's
house which is at the north of the city marked with a big red manillo head.

Speak to the Manillo at the right of this house (who is the chief). He'll
tell you to go to Gant.

Now before you leave I suggest to deposit all your money at the bank since
Gobi is no match for the creatures of the sea.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gant                                                            | IDXC00W |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| From Prima head straight south.                                           |
| When you can go no furhter go east until you see a way out of the sea     |
| Go south out of the sea there.                                            |
| From there head east and follow the way until you see the city of Gant    |
|                                                                           |
| (Once out of the sea you don't have to fear random encounters any more.   |
| the ones you'll get now are very easy).                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Go to the house far north of the village and speak to guy there. He wants
you to bring some goods to Prima. Open the chest to receive the goods and
then you're done here. Go back to Prima.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Prima (2)                                                       | IDXC00X |

| Gobi 15                                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Give the goods to the chief.
Then you'll be introduced to Ox in trouble.
Gobi will offer Ryu's help for 10000 gold, the chief will make an offer
for 5000. You can by saying "no" raise the offer to 6000. Accept it.

Now leave Prima and go to get Ryu and the others from the island (who can
no breathe underwater thanks to the Gills you got).

Now go back to Prima and go back to the Inn where Ox is, and fight that
reaper figure above him.

| Morteo is just the same as Morte and Mortea. His attacks are hardly       |
| impressive. This fight is a pushover.                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight Ox will join the party. You're next mission is in the land
west of Prima, but if you go to Gant you can get Karn's first fusion spell
now which I highly recommend to have.

I did something else first. As discribed below.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Krypt (Boomerang)                                               | IDXC00Y |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Requirements: Ox must have joined the party (IDXC00X)                     |
|               Don't forget the Fife (if you put it into a storage)        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ryu 18    | Nina 18    | Bo 19F     | Karn 16F   | Gobi 15F   | Ox 16     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| You remember where it is? South of Arad                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
All you need to do is to get a treasure you couldn't get before since you
need Ox to do the job. Enter the Krypt with the Fife, and let's get going

- Go through the door Karn opened for you on your previous visit and exit
  downstairs

- = Step off the platform
  = 4 steps south
  = Go east to the pillar
  = Stand south of the pillar
  = 7 steps south
  = 6 steps east
  = North
  = Exit downstairs

- Exit downstairs

- Head north and when you see a boomerang in a stone have Ox to destroy the
  stone and pick up the boomerang (it can be used as a weapon for Ryu, but
  it's broken, so you cannot equip it yet).

Now you're done here. Leave this place the same way you came.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| You cannot warp to Prima. Closest village would be Gant and to go to      |
| Prima from there. From Prima head west and get out of the water from      |
| there. Once out of the water head south and follow the way until you find |
| the place to be.                                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- Exit downstairs

- = Head south
  = Have Ox to destroy the rocks
  = Around the corner west
  = Exit upstairs (you can reach the treasure with Ox)

- = Use Ox to crush the north wall
  = Head north
  = Crush the north wall at the end
  = Crush the north wall on the right and go east
  = Kill the soldier who alarms
  = Go north
  = Crush the north wall at the end
  = Go east then south
  = Around the corner east and crush the northwall
  = Make your way north and exit downstairs at the end

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Basically this fight is the same as the one you fought at the beginning   |
| of the game. Only more damage. Can be around 50+. Since Nina is always    |
| the fastest when she casts a healing spell you can take more chances.     |
| Ryu in thunderdragon form, Karn as Shin and Nina for healing spells there |
| not much that can go wrong.                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight you can crush the north wall and use the stairs to get out.

It doesn't make sense to go on now. You cannot go into Nabal at this point.
There is a Dragon Challenge Shrine in this area, but you cannot take it on
yet since you must have a certain item to be allowed in which you don't have
at this moment (and cannot even have at this moment). Best you can do is to
go back to Gant (unless you don't have the B-Rang).

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gant and the old man                                            | IDXC010 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Requirements: - Fortress completed (IDXC00Z)                              |
|               - You must have the Boomerang from Krypt (IDXC00Y)          |

| Ryu 19    | Nina 18    | Bo 19F     | Karn 16F   | Gobi 15F   | Ox 16     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Go to Gant and go to the house in the north of town.
Show the Boomerang you found in Krypt to him and he'll fix it for you. You'll
automaticly rest in the process. Ryu can equip it as a weapon and I recommend
to do so.

Now leave Gant and head for the sea, but DON'T enter the sea.
Go east from the beach and you'll find a camp. Enter it and talk to the old man.
Now that you can show him the Boomerang (B-Rang) he'll give you a hint that
can be handy for entering Nabal. You'll have to use a GrimFowl. That hint
will get you in. Before you leave have Ox to hit a palm tree to get a Cockonut
which you need later in the game.

Now it's time to get to Nabal. For that you got to do the
Fortress over (alas). The route is the same as before so in this FAQ I'll
go directly to GrimFowl forest that lies between the fortress and Nabal.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GrimFowl Forest                                                 | IDXC011 |

| Go to the forest north of the fortress.                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When you get here you see GrimFowl birds all around. In one of the nests
is an egg. If there isn't go to section IDXC010 first.
Pick it up and one of the GrimFowls will attack you

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GrimFowl has a nasty BurnOut attack that can do 75+ damage. And a normal  |
| attack of 32+. Its HP is not impressive and you may not even need to turn |
| Ryu into a dragon. Just heal with Nina if you need and you'll be fine.    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Now pick up the egg. The other GrimFowls will follow you, but if you walk too
fast they will abandon you. So do this slowly, so you can be sure the
GrimFowls keep following you. Lead them up north to Nabal once you arrive
the GrimFowls will distract the guards so you can get in.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Go to the forest north of the fortress.                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
With the GrimFowls causing trouble here you can enter the castle.

- Enter the castle

- = Go east
  = First way north
  = At the end east
  = South
  = Exit downstairs

- = Go South
  = Follow the corridor
  = Prepare for a boss fight and have Ox to crush the wall at the end
  = Go north and fight the guards

| Don't bother killing them all at once. Just take them out one by one.     |

| These guys have no GUTS mode but they do have a trick. When you have      |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight this mission is over and you'll be in the Chief's house at
Prima. Go upstairs and talk to the Manillo who is in bed. He'll get out.
Search the bed to get the statue. Now you can go on to Wisdon.

  = Exit upstairs (the chest can be reached with Ox)

- = Get off the platform
  = Head north
  = Get onto the other platform
  = Exit upstairs

- Enter the castle

- You can use the fountain to recover.
  Exit upstairs

- Here you can see the sorceress sleeping. Talk to the ghosts protecting her
  and you got to fight them in three seperate battles to prove your strength.

After this you'll get to speak to Bleu the sorceress. She's a party member

- You can recover at the fountain.
  Exit south

- Exit downstairs

- Go south, exit upstairs at the end

- Leave Wisdon

Now you have to go to the Volcano which is to be found in the sea near Prima.

  = Follow the corridor
  = When you see a stairway, exit upstairs

  = Around the corner south
  = Exit upstairs

- = Go west
  = Aorund the corner south
  = You'll get by the lava
  = There's a small peninsula. Stand there and press action (default A)

Now there'll be an automated part in which you automaticly go to Wisdon to
recruit Bleu who'll immediatly join the party. After that you'll automaticly
end up in Prima.

|                                                                           |
| You may only replace 1 character per turn. I mostly keep this party up    |
| and switch only when I need Nina for healing.                             |
|                                                                           |
| For the quickest kill you could turn Ryu into a dragon and let Blue do    |
| her most powerful magic. You'll soon win.                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this battle you'll see a cutscene with Jade and Zog. In this cutscene
you'll also see Goda, Cort, Cerl and Mote. You could have guessed that you'll
meet those guys later in the game.

After the cutscene, Gobi will get his license back, and with that the ability
to transform into a fish. You need that ability to reach the next mission, so
DON'T FUSE HIM WITH KARN UNTIL YOU'RE OUT OF THE SEA AT THE POINT OF YOUR
DESTINATION!!!

Go back into Prima and talk to the chief. Open the two chests to get the
sphere.

| When you leave Prima put Gobi in the lead (he may NOT be fused with Karn) |
| and press action (default A) to turn him into a big fish.                 |
| Go towards the volcano north                                              |
| From there swim over the crack to the west.                               |
| Search this area for a way out of the water on an island                  |
| (NOT the mainland!!!) This can be hard to spot, but since you won't get   |
| random encounters with Gobi in fish form you can do this on a relaxed way |
|                                                                           |
| Get out of the water here. If you are on a small island with only a city  |
| you're on the right spot.                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
There's not much to do yet in Tunlan. You cannot speak the language of Tunlan
yet, which is nothing more but music notes. There comes a quest here later.
But this is the place where you can find Rod5 which you need for your next
dragon forms. And that is pretty important, ain't it?

If you find a girl who looks like Nina, pay no attention to it. You cannot do
anything with her (yet).

What is nice to know is that now that Gobi got his license back that you
are allowed a shop.  In Tunlan you can open a shop for Gobi. Do with that
what you like.

Now for that what we actually came for!
- Go north and enter the most northern building
- = Go north to the guards
  = Go east
  = Follow the way until you come at a stairway
  = Exit upstairs
- Go west and exit downstairs
- Try to open the chest on the west and a living statue will throw you to
  a floor below.
- Push the south-east crate and press action (default A). You'll find the
  Rod5.
- Push the crate in the south-west and you'll fall down.
- Go south and exit upstairs

Now you're done here. (for now)

| Requirements: You must have the Rod5 from Tunlan (IDXC016)                |
|               You must have fishing lure (a worm for example)             |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When you got the Rod5 from Tunlan and a fishing Lure (you can buy a worm from
Auria for this purpose) we can get moving.

= Warp to Romero.
= Leave Romero from the west side.
= Now put either Bo or Karn in Shin form in the lead.
= Go west through the forest (not to Karma Tower. Pass it north)
= When you're past the mountain go south
= Around the corner west
= Go to the well
= Equip Ryu with Rod5 and the fishing lure and put him in the lead
= Examine the well and Ryu will try fishing. You'll get a DragonSword
  (DragonSD)

That concludes this mission.

| Going there is hard since there's no spot nearby to warp to.              |
| Closest is to warp to Gant, walk over Prima to the fortress west of it.   |
| Go through the fortress (route is the same as before) and head west when  |
| you're back on the worldmap again.                                        |

| Follow the way and you'll find the shrine                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Once again the guard will only let Ryu in.
But he'll only let you pass if you have the DragonSD in your pocession.
You don't need to have it equipped but it must be in your inventory (and
not in the storage).

As before you gotta talk to the dragon spirit fight and fight a boss.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ryu has to fight alone and that is your only problem.                     |
| This fight is not so difrent than the one you fought against Talon.       |
| As long as you are in human form this fight can take very long. When you  |
| remember your fight against Talon you know how long that can be.          |
| So you can better transform into a dragon. That goes a lot quicker.       |
| The attacks are around 25. Bain is faster than you are so start healing   |
| as soon as you get close to 30 HP or if you wanna be safe under 50 HP.    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Now you'll receive 4 new dragon forms.
Ice Dragon, Fire Dragon, Bolt Dragon and Gold Dragon.
I must note never to use the Gold Dragon. It only works against undead and
costs too much AP.

After this you can leave the shrine and head on for the next quest.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Not much to do here, but to pass the village and exit north.
What is good to see is that some villagers have gone mad. To cure that is
the next mission. For that we need to go to the next dungeon.

| From Gust go north. You'll come in a sublocation, which is yet not of any |

| door north of the strange flower                                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- It's up to you if you wanna open the treasure chests, but getting close
  to them will result into a fight with a pretty strong enemy. For the good
  of this FAQ I'll skip that
  = Go north
  = First way east
  = At the very end north
  = Around the corner west
  = Follow the corridor (and ignore the crumbly walls you can destroy with Ox)
  = Exit upstairs at the end

- You'll meet Cort. Of of the servants of Zog. He'll try out a new formula
  on you and you'll shrink.
  Head north. There's a mousehole in the northwall. Exit through it.

- = Go north
  = Around the corner east
  You'll find some mice here. One of them runs an Inn for free. One mouse
  asks for help. If you spoke to that one another mouse will make way.
  = Go into that entrance to the north
  = Follow the way north
  = At the end go east
  = 1st way north
  = At the end you'll meet some giant cockroaches. Kill them!

| I say to transform Ryu into the BoltDragon works best. Bleu should use    |
| her most powerfull spells that hit all targets. Nina as a healer and      |
| either Karn (as Shin) as attacker or Ox.                                  |

  = Go north
  = Take the M-Cura from the chest
  You'll automaticly get out and get your normal size back

- Take the northern stairs down

After this fight this mission is over. Bleu will temporarily leave the party

| This fly is (of course) very fast and has strong attacks and can even do  |
| "Slam". Since Nina is always the fastest in healing and since this fly    |
| has little HP this fight is very extremely easy.                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Pick up the fly
Leave the cave and leave Gust.
Make your way into the sea.

Now if Gobi is fused to Karn, unfuse him and transform him into a fish.
= Go south.
= When you are in the most southern part head east.
= At the end north
= First way east over the stalgmites (you can only do that with Gobi as fish)
= Head south
= Turn Gobi back in his normal form
= Go south out of the sea

Enter the cave here.
Give the fly to the frog in the northcenter.

Warp back to Gust
Enter ths south-east house and give the Oil to Bleu.

Now go out and dispose of the flower north of Gust.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight Karn will unfuse, like it or not.
Anyway go back to Gust.
Go to the house in the southeast (If you fused Karn again, he'll unfuse once
more. Oh bummer).
After that RugaX 2

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight Karn will once again unfuse.
After this Nicolie will fix the bridge and you get a free rest.

Now head north and go to the bridge which is north-west of Gust.
Of course, an old RPG cliche is that bridges means fights.
So you get a fight.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Follow the mole girl

You'll find Mogu who is trapped under a curse of Mote. Talk to the old mole
next to Mogu. You'll receive a Cowl. With that you can understand the
language of Tunlan. However you cannot speak it unless you already found the
Maestro. It's hidden in a bed of a man in Gust. (Middle house west of Gust)
With that go to Tunlan.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Find it easily by going into the sea by Gust, head south from there and   |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
It's important that you start this misson by day. If it's not day wait on
the worldmap to get dark (or use the Hourglass if you have it).

Go to the palace (big building north of town)
Once there speak to the green old lady between the guards
She'll make a proposal. Accept it. She'll make way. Go upstairs and talk
to the princess. Man... she has a problem and is not willing to listen to
reason. Go back downstairs.

Talk to the green old lady. She'll tell you that the princess has marks on
her back which tells you how to open the safe. She'll walk away. Now leave
Tunlan and wait for nightfall. When it's night enter Tunlan again.

Go into the castle again.

- = Walk past the guards and go east
  = Follow the way and exit upstairs

- Go west (ignore the stairs) and go through the crack in the wall
  (Yes, peeking on a lady taking a bath).
  Examine the princess form beind the potted palms and you'll see the marks.
  You don't have to memorize what the game says.
  Go back through the crack and take the western stairs down

- = Go to the old lady and talk to her.
  = Examine the door on the left side of the lady first
  = Now examine the door on the right side of the lady

Now you'll get a pretty hillarious sequence. At the end of this all Cerl will
steal the key, so result is zero. You'll end up in bed.

- = Go south from the princess' bed.
  = At the end west
  = Exit upstairs

- West and exit downstairs

Open all chests, but make sure not to open the chests in the corners from the
south. The one in the north-east corner contains the Bolster and that is
what you need. This mission is finished. Let's get out of here.

Talk to the old man to enter Mogu's mind.

WARNING! Once you entered you cannot get out until all missions in Mogu's
         mind are completed!

You'll be in an illusion city. Leave the house you're in.
Outside you'll see all versions of Mogu. Each of them represent one of Mogu's
emotions.

This tower is your worst nightmare. It doesn't get much worse than this when
it comes to dungeon design. It's not the random encounters that make this
dungeon hard, it's the way this dungeon is designed.

First of all this dungeon is a maze. But that is not the worst part of it.
No.... far from it.

Whenever you step on a back button (and you will) all the walls will become
invisible making it next to impossible to navigate through it. (I hope I
tell you the shortest route and that you can follow me right). Whenever you
step on a red button the walls will become visible again.

Perhaps you can imagine why you will hate this dungeon already.

Let's get started.

VISIBLE:
= Step on the black button

INVISIBLE:
= Go east

VISIBLE:
= Around the corner north, then around the corner east, then north
= At the crossing north

INVISIBLE:
= Go north till you can't go further
= 3 steps west
= North till you can't go further
= Go West

VISIBLE:
= Keep going west
= First way south
= East
= First way south
= Around the corner west
= At the end south
= First way east
= Around the corner north
= Speak to the boy at the end

This boy is the monster that keeps Mogu trapped in this dream world.
He says that as long as Mogu's senses are scattered you cannot beat him.
I regret to tell you this, but he's right. At this moment he has infinite
HP so don't even try to take him on (if you were foolish enough to do, you
can run away). You must have spoken to him in order to proceed to the next
dungeon (alas).

For now let's get out of here and come back later. I strongly suggest to let
Bleu cast "Exit". (Normally I would write a way out without using Exit, but
for this dungeon I'll make an exception)

Head back to the city. A girl will be on the worldmap. Talk to her.
Enter the city. Go to the front house and talk to the girl.

Now you can leave for the marshes.


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| = From the city head west                                                 |
| = Cross the bridge south                                                  |
| = First way east                                                          |
| = First way north and you'll get into the marshes                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The marshes are terrible. There are many invisible vents that acts as barriers
Let's go.
= North
= As soon as you reach the bones west
= As soon as you reach the bones north
= As soon as you reach the bones east
= Go east not touching the bones until you're standing north of a rock
= 3 steps north
= West till the rock
= 2 steps north
= 4 steps west
= 3 steps north
= 8 steps east
= 1 step south
= 15 steps east
= 2 steps north
= 3 steps east
= 4 steps north
= 5 steps west
= 1 step south
= 3 steps west
= 1 south
= 10 west
= 3 north
= 2 west
= 3 north
= 3 west
= 4 north
= 4 west
= 4 north
= 7 east
= 2 south
= 2 east
= 1 south
= 4 east
= 5 north
= 1 east
= 2 north
= 12 west
= north till your way is blocked by bones
= 9 east
= 1 north
= 9 east
= 5 north
= 8 west
= 1 south
= 8 west
= 2 north
= 1 east.
= 7 north.
= 1 east.
= 2 south.
= 1 east.
= 1 south.
= 3 east.
= 3 north.
= 3 east.
= 2 north.
= 2 east.
= 4 north.
= 3 west.
= 2 north.

Whew you're out of here (bad news you got to go back later).
Enter the cave

Here you'll find Mogu's Courange. Talk to it and all emotions of Mogu will
join together and form Mogu who'll join the party.

After that leave the cave.

As I said bad news, you gotta go back through the marshes. The Warp spell
is disabled. Of course you can allow yourself to get killed that way you'll
end up at the dragon shrine in the city. :) (Your money will be halved, though)


The way is the same as before. Think backwards. I can write that out in this
FAQ for you though.

= 2 south
= 3 east
= 4 south
= 2 west
= 2 south
= 3 west
= 3 south
= 3 west
= 1 north
= 1 west
= 2 north
= 1 west
= 7 south
= 20 east
= 4 south
= west till you reach the bones
= 1 south
= 9 west
= 16 south
= 12 east
= 4 south
= 2 west
= 3 south
= 4 west
= 2 north
= 3 west
= 1 north
= 4 west
= 4 south
= 5 east
= 6 south
= 4 east
= 4 south
= east till you reach the bones
= 2 north

= 4 south
= 3 west
= 1 south
= 8 west
= 2 south
= 8 west
= 2 north
= 7 west
= 4 south
= 6 east
= From here south then east and follow the way without touching the bones

Now be grateful that you NEVER have to get back here again.

Now that Mogu is whole again you can now defeat the monster in the tower.
So that's the place to go. (you may want to rest in the city before you
continue though).

4 levels of misary. Good luck.

Look well how the road goes and follow it (if you memorize it well you see
how it goes for when it turns invisible). This road is easy to follow and
needs to further description.

At the end you'll meet the boy again. Fight him.

| This monster starts the game in GUTS mode, so there's no telling at all   |
| how much HP it has left.                                                  |
|                                                                           |
| It has a pretty high dodge rate and can even dodge spells. That can be    |
| pretty annoying.                                                          |
|                                                                           |
| It has poison moves and when you got status changes you cannot transform  |
| or fuse, so I suggest to transform Ryu into the BoltDragon in the first   |
| turn. If Karn isn't already fused, then Fuse him to Shin. Now that you    |
| are transformed you can not be poisoned any more. What still works though |
| is the Shock spell which can kill you instantly. When that happens you'll |
| transform back into a human and be killed.                                |
|                                                                           |
| Now I say to use Ryu, Karn and Ox for the attack. I let Bleu go crazy     |
| with the Blast spell. When I needed to I put Nina in front as a healer    |
| when I don't need to I have her on the back row. Mogu should not be used  |
| at all in this battle as you can only get him killed. And that goes for   |
| the rest of the game acutally.                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this battle you'll be teleported out of the dream world back into the
real world. You'll not be able to return here.

Now you can leave Gramor and head for the next mission, but before you do
make Mogu dig at the strange plants to obtain the Root. You need it later
in the game.

It really doesn't look like spring in Spring. That is Mote's work actually.
Your next mission is to do something about that in the next dungeon Spyre.
Once you started Spyre you'll come past a point where there's no way out,
so if you have any preperations to make, do it now!

When you are ready, get on the ice and leave the village to the south

Once south of Spring put Mogu in the lead and make him dig directly south
of the tower to enter

Now that you're in you can only get out with the "Exit" spell or with some
"Exits" that make you fall out at the higher levels.

- = North
  = Exit downstairs

- = Go south
  = Go east
  = Follow the way and take the first sideway north
  = Follow the way and go east at the end
  = Follow the road
  = When you get on the flat rock go west
  = From here the way to the exit is easy.

- Take the other stairs up

From here things will go very strange. Great rooms (not really handy to
navigate through) and you'll meet all enemies you met before starting with
the slimes and fleas of the beginning of the game and getting harder stuff
as you get one floor higher.

All I can do is give a pointer of where to search the exit for the next
floor.

One warning, don't go through the openings in the walls. You'll fall out of
the tower and have to start over again.

- Floor 1: Grass
  Exit:    East area

- Floor 2: Darkness and rain
  Exit:    South area (close to west)

- Floor 3: Sand
  Exit:    From the entrance south, when you see the south wall east

- Floor 4: Snow
  Exit:    East

- Floor 5: The Sky
  Exit:    South-west corner of the room

- Floor 6: Space
  Exit:    North, near east

The "Exit" is the pillar that holds the next Goddess key. However when you
try to take it, Mote will appear and warp you into a dream world.

You'll get in an illusionairy city where more victims of Mote are.
There's a dragon shrine to save your game and an Inn to rest and to buy stuff
here. You cannot get out until you defeat Mote. When you're ready leave this
city and head for the next dungeon in this dream world.

- The Tower starts with one of the worst rooms of the game.
  (I wonder which is worse. This or the invisible maze of Mogu's mind)
  This is a small maze, but every time you step on a plate the screen will
  rotate a few times. The number of rotations in always the same, so thank
  God there's no random factor in this, but navigating will be hell.
  In this matter it's very important to keep track of the points I give and
  the way you walk.

  Here goes:
  = North
  = Step on the rotation plate
  = West
  = Step on the rotation plate
  = South
  = Around the corner west
  = Around the corner north
  = Step on the rotation plate
  = North
  = Step on the rotation plate
  = East
  = First way south
  = Around the corner east
  = At the end south
  = Step on the rotation plate
  = West until you step on the next rotation plate
  = West
  = Second way north
  = Around the corner west
  = Around the corner south onto the next rotation plate
  = West
  = Around the corner north
  = Step on the teleporter to get outta here.
  Of course you realize that when you mess up with fighting you'll have to
  do this over again. No there are no mores savespots between this point and
  the boss.

- = West
  = Around the corner north
  = Go to the room with the purple tile
  = Go around the purple tile and exit upstairs

- This part is forcing you to step on the yellow plates and hurt you in the
  process. In the south-east part of this room is a pit-fall that takes you
  to the next room

- Go north (around the yellow tile) and exit upstairs

- Exit upstairs

- This room is horrible. There are hidden pits here, so walk exactly as I say:
  = 7 west
  = 8 south
  = Exit upstairs

- All stairs are fake except for one.
  Taking the wrong stairway will have you to start over
  The most south-east one is the one you must have

- Now make sure everybody is full HP, MP and free of statusses
  Now head north to face Mote

| Don't thing there's anything wrong with your SNES. Mote looks like he's   |
| supposed to look. Please do not transform Ryu into a dragon. Karn may be  |
| fused though. Also use no attacking magic. Only use magic for healing if  |

| Now the battle truely begins.                                             |
|                                                                           |
| Let's explain how this exactly works first.                               |
| The unclear form of Mote is what I call the liquid form. In that form     |
| Mote is protected against magic but weak against physical attacks.        |
| When you attack Mote physically he'll become more solid. In solid form he |
| is weak against magic but protected against physical attacks.             |
| I must say that this is a brilliant boss! Especially considering the time |
| this game was written in.                                                 |
|                                                                           |
| When you start the battle focus on physical attacks first so that he      |
| becomes more solid. When he becomes too solid to be hurt transform into   |
| the boltdragon. You attacks in dragon form count as magic. Now Ryu and    |
| Bleu can be used to make him liquid again. Karn (in Shin Form) and Ox can |
| make him solid and so you keep your attacks balanced. If needed Nina      |
| could heal. And keep this up until this one is dead.                      |
|                                                                           |
| What you must watch out for is once he's in the GUTS mode. Cause then he  |
| get a lot of critical attacks (Slam), even in his Inferno spell. When     |
| you use Nina has healer, be prepared that she may not survive it.         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight is over, this mission will end. You'll be transported back
into the real world in again on the top floor of Spyre.
First of all search the pillar for the Goddess Key (SkyKey).

The quickest way to get out is by using Bleu's "Exit" spell, otherwise you
can get out on any floor by stepping through an opening in the walls.

The only way to get to any location now is by using the Warp spell.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
You must start by warping to Spring.

Before you do anything else I suggest to go fishing in the small lake with
Ryu equipped with a Rod5 and a random fishing lure. You'll catch a Dragon
Armor which you can equip on Ryu and which you need later in the game.
(if you don't succeed your inventory is probably full).

Now go to the waterfall north, there's an exit there that leads to the cave

- This is the final cave between two cities. So the end is getting closer
  (But far from near)
  = north
  = follow the corridor
  = Exit upstairs

- = West
  = Follow the corridor
  = Exit south at the end

Next stop: Carmen

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
In Carmen all citizens appear to be frozen except for one. Not that you really
can do anything with him though. Because of this the inn and shops and all
sort of thing are at this moment unavailable. The Dragon Shrine is still
available though.

What you can learn from the only man who is not frozen is that something
must be wrong in a tower called Tock. So that's the next area to be.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- = North
  At the north side is a fountain as compensation that the Inn in Carmen
  is unavailable
  = Go west

  = GO east
  = Step on the arrow
  = Step on the arrow north
  = Go all the way west
  = At the end south
  = Second way east
  = Second way north
  = Step on the arrow to warp west
  = Exit upstairs

- Warning there's an exit here that can make you have to start this dungeon
  over.
  = Warp south
  = Get on the middle platform
  = Exit upstairs

- Here you have truely a tricky situation of a lot of arrows. If you wanna
  do this on your own I'd say to walk around this room some times to analyse
  this well before you start on this.
  If you're relying solely on me, then here goes:
  = Go to the north-east corner of this room
  = when you are north of the stairway go directly south till you can go no
    further.
  = 1 west, 1 south (you'll disappear behind a pillar)
  = 3 west
  = 1 step east, 2 south
  = 1 step west
  = 1 south
  = 1 east
  = 1 east
  = 1 north, 2 east
  = 1 east
  = 1 east
  = 2 east
  = 1 north
  = 1 north
  = Go north, exit upstairs

- East, first way north
  You'll meet Cerl and she ain't pleased.
  You won't get to fight her yet. In stead you'll be warped to the worldmap.
  If you have Mrbl3 that turns off random encounters then use it, since Ryu
  is on his own now.

To get back to Carmen, go east, first way north onto the ramp then
west and follow the way.

When you reach the top go to Alan and Cerl. This time Cerl will offer a fight.

| Her attacks are pathetic, but her time-outs can make you skip turns which |
| is annoying.                                                              |

| When Cerl is getting low in HP she'll stop the fight.                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
You'll once again be kicked out of the tower but and you'll land at some
kind of check point. Once again the party got seperated but since you got
Nina with you this time warp back to Carmen.

Go to the house north-east (next to the windmill)
There the party will reunite and you gotta search the Fruit that Alan
mentions.

Leave Carmen and go search for the Fruit. You need Ox for this mission so
he may not be fused with Karn.

Go south from Carmen en head east when you reach the forest.
First way south down the ramp.
Head west until you see a tree. Have Ox to hit it to receive the Fruit.
Pick up the Fruit and head east

Follow the path. When the path stops continue south.
Follow the way and you'll reach the checkpoint castle.

Go to the gate of the castle and Cerl will recognize the Fruit as Alan
predicted. Cerl will let you into the castle. Go upstairs and after your
chat with Cerl open the chest to get the Time Key.

Now Goda will interfere and.... well see for yourself what will happen.

After this you'll be warped to the top of Tock. Exit upstairs and go north.

Nina will set the time right but will be engulfed in a time-warp and
diappear, and that will bring us to the next mission. To get Nina back.

Oh great. Nina is sucked into a time warp and now we need to figure out where
she is...

Wait a minute... That's easy.
Do you recall seeing a girl who looks like Nina in Tunlan?
Actually it IS Nina. She was sucked into the past and ended up in Tunlan with
amnesia.

Go to Tunlan. You'll see a mysterious man next to the dragon shrine. Talk to
him. He'll tell you about a doctor in Carmen. Now go to the house were Nina
is. You can ask around here, but since Nina has amnesia she doesn't know
who you are. But the mysterious man has given the right hint.
So leave Tunlan and Warp to Carmen.

(I heard many horror stories over doing this on foot since you can no longer
warp. That's bullshit. You still can warp. Bleu too has the warp spell).

The old man in the windmill north-east is the doctor the mysterious man
was talking about. Talk to him and he'll offer to make you a tonic that
can cure Nina.

He wants the next items
- W-Ant IDXC00J    -> Chest in Aria and also Bleak. Can also be obtained by
                      hunting white stags (very rare animals)
- Root  IDXC01H    -> Dig for root south of Gramor
- C-Nut IDXC010    -> Ox should hit the palm tree near the old man near Gant
- P-Fish           -> Walk through the checkpoint where Cerl disappeared and
                      walk all the way till you get a broken bridge.
                      Fish there
Gather the ingredients but before you leave talk to the mysterious man in
the north-east and he'll disappear. Search the spot where he was and you'll
find a pass. You need it later.

Once you found all the ingredients go back to Carmen and the doctor will mix
you a Tonic.

Now that you have the Tonic go back to Tunlan and cure Nina. She'll recognize
you and join the party again. Not only that, she's also gained the ability to
transform into a big bird. This will make travelling on the world map much
easier since you can go anywhere now without being attacked by enemies. Not
only that you can now reach places you can't reach otherwise.

+---- BONUS ----------------------------------------------------------------+
| And with that comes a big hint, you can only do it now, later it can be   |
| gone and never be done again.                                             |

| Warp to Romero. There transform into a bird and fly to the small island   |
| north with two tiny towers. Put anyone but Nina in the lead and search    |
| the towers to find the Tri-Rang. IMHO the best weapon for Ryu.            |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The Shrinekeeper will only let Ryu in and only when you got the Dragon in
your inventory (or equipped) in the storage doesn't count.


When you proceed you got to fight Avian

| The Fight against Avian is semiliar then your previous challenge battles  |
| Avain can do 45 in an attack but it can also do Slam. (100-180 damage)    |

| Turn Ryu into a Bolt Dragon, attack all the time and heal when wounded.   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When you win this battle you'll obtain Rudra.
Now you should have completed all dragon shrines.
If so you can take on the quest to obtain the ultimate form Agni.

Agni is the ultimate dragon form. The Dragon spirit that gives you this form
is hidden in the cave west of Romero. The route through that cave is the
same as before. If you are unsure check section IDXC00B.

When you reach the water step into it. Thanks to the gills you can now
breathe underwater and that also goes here.

- Go all the stairs down exit north at the end

- Speak to the dragon spirit and you'll obtain Agni
  (If not you did not fill all the requirements)

I suggest to use "Exit" to get out and not to waste time on the encounters
here. If you don't well, the way is easy, right.

Before you use Agni one notice. In order to use it ALL party members must
be alife. None of them may have any status disabilities, and none of them

| = Now you can see the Dark Dragon City Scande. Land west of it and enter  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- = Speak to the guards and you'll show them the pass and they'll let you in
    (If you don't have the pass find it in Carmen, section IDXC01T)
  = Head east
  = When you examine the elevator it appears to be broken
  = When you ask around it seems that somebody from spring has the stuff to
    repair it.
  = Leave scande.

Warp to Spring. The man you're looking for is in the south directly south
of the dragon shrine. Speak to him and he'll give the parts. Now go to Gant
On the top-floor of the house north is a man in bed who can fix the parts
Speak to the old lady to wake him up. Go back to Scande

- = Show the pass to the guards
  = Put the parts into the device next to the elevator
  = Step onto the elevator to go up
  = Step onto the other elevator to go up
  = Exit north

- Speak to the mysterious man and exit back south

- Go down with both elevators and leave Scande

Don't you get tired of this? Well, this is the last time we got to leave Scande
before we can finally go on, so grin and bear it. Warp to Tunlan.
The "DragonHeart" song can be obtained from a girl from the first house
you get to when you head straight north. It's a song that hurts Dragons and
since Ryu is a Dragon he'll get to 1 HP, so get him fixed before you continue.
Now you can get to Scande and finally go to business.

- Get up with the elevators and exit north

- = North
  = Around the corner west then north
  = West
  = Around the corner north
  = Go west around the platform north
  = Exit upstairs

- = Don't step on the switches (unless the gate is closed) and go south
  = At the end of this hall take the left way south (the right should be
    closed anyway)
  = Exit upstairs

- = Go north
  = Follow the corridor
  = Exit upstairs

- = Go south
  = Follow the corridor
  = Exit downstairs

- Take the other stairs up

- = South
  = Exit upstairs

- Use the fountain if you need it and go north
  Exit north

- Now you are in Zog's room. If you have followed my advice to go for Agni
  then make sure everybody is alife, clean of status changes and NOT fused
  with Karn.
  Go north to meet Zog.

| It's very tempting to use the DragonHeart song from Tunlan here, but      |
| DON'T DO THAT!!! Zog is hardly affected and Ryu will be at 1 HP. There's  |
| a fight in which that song has more effect later.                         |
|                                                                           |
| I say to turn Ryu into Agni and get you'll hardly get hurt. you'll always |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
After this fight some scenario will take place. You'll lose all Godess Keys,
but you didn't need them anymore anyway. You'll be in a small dungeon.
Go south and the mole people will appear and let you out. Jump into the hole
they'll dig for you.

- = Go north
  = east then north
  = At the fork east
  = At the end south
  = Speak to the mole and the master digger will dig a hole for you.

- Exit south

- Go up all the stairs and leave Scande

    Agua should appear, if not you put the tablet in the storage. Get it out
    of there.
  = Enter

- Now put Karn in the lead always during this dungeon.
  (It doesn't matter if he's fused or not)
  Exit upstairs

- = Open the lock to the north
  = Exit upstairs

- Have Karn to open the door and exit upstairs

- Once again have Karn to open the door and exit upstairs

- = Go west

  = Take the platform south
  = Go south

- Go east and exit north

- Go west and exit upstairs (IGNORE THE MOVING PLATFORM)

- Go north and enter the shrine

- Go north and after the chat exit upstairs

Now you'll get into the next mission. Step on the teleporter pad to enter.

The White Towers have a very messy setup and getting lost there is quite easy.
However there is a kind of logic in here so it's not that hard to get this
place done.

- = Go east
  = First way north
  = Step on the switch
  = Upstairs onto the platform
  = East
  = Around the corner south
  = Exit upstairs

- = East
  = Follow the way
  = At the fork south
  = Follow the way
  = Exit downstairs

- = Open the gate with the switch left
  = Take the left way north
  = Follow the way
  = When you get by the switches activate the one right
  = South
  = At the end east
  = At the end take the right way north
  = Step at the left switch and go back south
  = Go west
  = At the end take the right way north
  = Follow the corridor
  = Step on the right switch and go north
  = Follow the way and exit upstairs

- = Follow the way
  = Exit upstairs at the end

- Go onto the platform and you'll meet Sara.
  Sad as it may seem you got to fight her.
  Before you do heal yourself as all party members are reduced to 1 HP

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| If you saved the Dragon Heart Song, use it now. Both Ryu and Sara will be |
| reduced to 1 HP. So it's easy to finish her off.                          |
|                                                                           |
| If you already used Dragon Heart before then turn into Agni and then this |
| fight should be easy.                                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
This is a sad ending of the quest your set out to do, but it's the way it is.
Still Jade and Tyr remain, so the battle is not over. You can heal but
there's a recovery fountain close by.

  Exit downstairs

- = Follow the way west
  = Drink at the fountain (I'm sure you'll need it)
  = Head west
  = At the end exit downstairs

- Take the other stairs up

- Now watch out!!! DON'T FALL INTO THE PIT OR YOU'LL HAVE TO DO THINGS OVER!
  = Go south
  = At the end east (the way is there, though you don't see it)
  = Go north
  = Exit upstairs

- You rember the maze that turns visible and invible back in Mogu's mind?
  This one works the same:

  VISIBLE:
  = West
  = Go south
  = Follow the path
  = Take the platform at the end
  = Go south
  = Follow the path
  = Ignore the platform and exit upstairs at the end

- Step on the platform to go north.
  You'll meet Jade but you don't get to fight him yet.
  What exactly happens is a bit vague, but you'll end up in Drogen.

Karn will report that Jade has resurrected Obelisk. That is the final mission
of the game. Make sure you are prepared before you head out to take on
Obelisk.

This is an irritating mission, but it has to be done, since you cannot enter
Obelisk if you don't.

There are no clues to be found on that you got to do this either. So here I
am to help since I think you'd be searching around eternally otherwise.

Warp to Auria. Leave the city and transform into a bird.
Fly a bit over the sea to the north and you'll find a house on a small island
Land here and go to the house. You'll meet an old lady here. Talk to her and
she'll say she's a weapon collector who wants to share her hobby. Leave here.
Now go to the old man near Gant. Talk to him and he's very interested in the
old lady. He'll give you a list of his collection. You can find it in a chest
in his tent.
Now you gotta go back to the old lady and give her the list. (You can get
there easily by flying straight north from the old man's place). She'll say
she got something usual and wants you to bring it to the old man so he can
identify it. You gotta take it out of a chest in her house to get the Wtzit.
Now you gotta go back to the old man. He doesn't yet know what it is but
he doesn't think it's a weapon. He'll give you a letter bring it to the old
woman. Since it's not a weapon she'll no longer be interested in that thing
Go back to the old man. The man has identified the item and it appears to
be an I-Claw. A tool used by the mole people.

Now warp to Gramor. Go to the room in the north-east of town. There is the
master digger. Let Mogu talk to him and he'll teach you how to use it.

Now you can enter Obelisk and finish this matter for once and for all.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
- Put Mogu in the lead open the door and exit north (if you try to let Nina
  do it she'll turn into a bird and fly away).

- Walk to the crack and have Mogu to dig a hole here with the I-Claw. You'll
  fall to the next room

  The design can be a bit confusing, but it's not hard to find the way here.
  The enemies here are pain. The hardest enemies of the game are in this room.
  If you don't want to meet them (as they take a lot of time to beat) I
  suggest to use Mrbl3 here

| a bloody acorn if you don't have enough AP. Once in Agni Jade's attacks   |

| One thing is there you must watch out for. Jade has the instant kill      |
| spell "Shock". It misses most of the time but when it hits it even works  |
| against Agni. When Agni gets killed Ryu will turn back into a human and   |
| be killed, however the rest of the party will live. So you can revive     |
| Ryu and try it again to turn Ryu into Agni again.                         |

  You can use the orage area as an elevator to reach the lair of the Goddess.

| You can just cut her down and she'll do nothing in return. But to defeat  |
| her you MUST use Agni whether you like it or not (if you missed Agni you  |
| do have a problem, I heard stuff about bad endings without Agni, but I    |
| woudn't know about it). Attack her once in Agni form and the Goddess will |
| show her true self.                                                       |

| Basically this goes into a new fight (she's ugly by the way). The recipe  |
| is easy. Turn Ryu into Agni and attack her with Agni all the way and      |
| heal when needed. You'll reach the GUTS mode pretty quickly but overall   |
| this fight is long and boring and won't get interesting at all.           |
| What a disappointment for the final fight.                                |

+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
For some games I do like to write a FAQ, but since sites like GameFAQs and
many others are already swamped with it, it's not likely they will accept
my work. (Can't blame 'em either).

I only go for complete walkthroughs, so no in-depth FAQs on this matter.
If you want me to write a FAQ on one of the games below, mail me (AND DON'T
FORGET TO ADD "[Tric-FAQ]" TO THE SUBJECT). I won't use your e-mail for any
other reason than as a signature of petition. When enough people are thinking
I can do a better job than the (undoubtly) great FAQs there already are, I'll
start on it. When you look at this FAQ and my other walkthroughs then you
know how I create walkthroughs, so you know what to expect from me.

These games are available for request:
= Final Fantasy X
= Final Fantasy IX
= Final Fantasy VII

Don't start mailing me saying you don't want me to do this. You won't receive
an answer and you'll be banned from mailing me. If the FAQs ever appear it
means there are enough people who want me to do this, and I work for them.

That is my Q&A site where I (or others) will answer all your game questions.

before. :)

If you want to inquire about me as a person, or when you have anything to
say about the FAQ itself, like asking permission to host, got suggestions
for this FAQ, something like that please mail it to

       tric1975@hotmail.com

       AND PUT [Tric-FAQ] IN THE SUBJECT OR ELSE MY SPAMFILTER MAY
       REJECT YOU!

If you see that I missed things in this FAQ, then in stead of calling me
names, you may tip me about that part, or if you want even come up with
a complete workout of that part, that I will copy into this FAQ (I may alter
your lay-out to make it fit with the rest) and even credit you for your
trouble. This also goes for alternate boss techniques.

AND NEVER FORGET TO TELL ME WHICH FAQ OF MINE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
I get a lot of mails in which I must guess which FAQ it is we're talking
about, and since I'm very busy as a contributor for GameFAQs, and ocasionally
other sites, I have quite a lot of FAQs here. So it will help me a lot when
I know which FAQ/Game it is you're talking about. :)

And one last thing. Below are remarks I got a lot about my FAQs. Some are
funny, and some are just plainly too stupid for words. I don't want to be
an arrogant bastard or anything, but some of them tire me a lot.
So here are those mails with my standard replies:

  M: Fix your English
  A: Some people say they hardly hear the diffrence between me and an
     English speaking fellow. Others say it sucks. Well, I honestly don't
     care in which category you are. English is NOT my first language. If
     I spoke my own language you probably couldn't read my FAQs at all.

  M: You suck in levelling up
  A: I know. I'm a real RPG player. I don't waste my time hours of levelling
     up. In my vision that's a sort of cheating. If I wanted to do that,
     I'd buy a gameshark. That works a lot faster.
     No offense to those who do believe in that.

  M: HEY IDIOT! FIX YOUR FAQ!
  A: Anyone who sends mail like this won't receive a reply. In fact they
     will be banned from ever mailing me again. I can understand you do not
     agree with my technique. There are as many as there are people. I can
     also agree you detected that I made a mistake. Well, I'm human you know.
     Making mistakes is part of my nature, as much as it's yours. If you
     detect errors in my FAQ you can tell me about it in a civil way, and
     I'll fix it if I agree with you.

  M: I took on the bosses you brant HARD on much lower levels with no problem
     at all.
  A: Good for you.

  M: Are you a man? A woman? How old are you? Where do you live?
  A: I really got that kind of mails a lot. I don't mind that you know.
     I was quite amused by such mails actually.
     Well, my name is Jeroen Broks. I'm not going to give my private adres
     in this FAQ or anywhere else on the internet, but you may know that
     I live in the Netherlands, I am a man, and I was born in 1975. So on
     the moment I started on this version of this FAQ I was 31 years old.

  M: Fsdasdadasf afsdfasd afdfsaf
  A: Whatever you say I don't understand it. If you mail me, please only do
     so in either English or Dutch or if you really need in German.
     (Be perpared that if you speak German to me, you might get an answer in
     English, tough).
     I don't speak any other language.

  M: May I translate your FAQ into another language?
  A: If you ask my permission, mostly no problem

  M: Why is Neoseeker banned from hosting your FAQs?
  A: I have my reasons which I'm not going to tell.
     That's because I want to handle this type of thing as a profesional should
     I only noted it to make sure this document would not end up there
     unoticed.

  M: You know NOTHING about this game or RPG in general?
  A: That I know nothing about RPG in general is something you can't say.
     I spend 80% of my free time in RPG (which is quite a lot, trust me),
     and I even develop them myself for a hobby. And about this game,
     trust me when I say that all games I wrote a FAQ about have been played
     multiple times from start to finish, and after I completed the FAQ
     the game is played over and over again and again, so I can upgrade
     the FAQ if I find something new, to make sure my FAQs offer the best
     you can get. All games I wrote FAQs about are games I'm very devoted
     to. No exceptions. If I am not sure I know the game, I won't write a
     FAQ on it.

  M: Your FAQs are the greatest!
  A: Thanks I'm honored that you speak of my work this way.

  M: Thank you for writing this great FAQ!
  A: You're welcome ;)

  M: Do you have any GameShark/GameGenie codes for game X?
  A: No. If you want cheats, you're asking the wrong person!

And so far this FAQ. I hope you have good use for it!
