Hello and welcome to my Breath of Fire FAQ/Walkthrough for the GameBoy Advance.
This is the fourth FAQ that I have created and I hope that it is to your liking
as I have put much time and effort into it. This is the first Japanese RPG that
I have written a walkthrough for so bear with me here as I'm a little new at
this. Breath of Fire isn't a too entirely challenging or long RPG along the
lines of Golden Sun, but it a fabulous role-playing experience nonetheless.
Though it boasts no groundbreaking aspects in its gameplay, graphics, or sound,
I still very much enjoy this game and I am sure you will too, RPG fan or not. I
have made a comprehensive walkthrough for this game to help out any fellow
gamers throughout the game as some parts can be tricky and you may not know
where to go next. As always, if you have any questions, information, or
feedback for me, you can email me at peacenlove08@yahoo.com. Enjoy.

Other Battling Information
==========================

 * Battles occur randomly in any area where there is enemy activity, including
   the World Map and any other dungeons, forests, caves, etc.

 * In battle your character and allies can strike with a Slam attack, doubling
   the damage done to the enemy. Also, your character/allies will, at times,
   strike back at an enemy with a counter attack (Cntr) after being hit. These
   attacks occur randomly in battle.

 * In boss battles, though the boss may appear to be at 0 HP, they may flash
   and still stand for a few more hits

 * When your entire party is in the Stun state (all allies are down to 0 HP),
   you are warped out of battle to the last Dragon Statue that you saved at.

 * After every battle, the amount of experience points (EP) and gold (GP) you
   receive will be shown on the screen, followed by any items that the enemy
   dropped.

             |   Ryu is a descendant of the White Dragon Tribe  |
             |   and has the ability to turn into a dragon. The |
             |   tribe has sealed its power after almost        |
             |   destroying the world in the Goddess War of     |
             |   several thousand years ago. However, it is     |
             |   allowed to use it when the world is in danger  |
             |   in order to save it, Ryu lost his parents when |
             |   he was young and now lives with his sister, a  |
             |   shaman who can summon powerful magic. Ryu's    |
             |   hobby is fishing.                              |

             |   Gobi is from a tribe of traders who boast that |
             |   they will one day control the world's          |
             |   commerce. Their trade area is any place that   |
             |   touches the sea. They are notorious for their  |
             |   greed, and Gobi is especially greedy - his own |
             |   tribesmen shun him and he has been expelled by |
             |   the tribal leader. Because of this, his        |
             |   ability to turn into a huge fish is sealed and |
             |   his life of commerce is very limited. However, |
             |   Gobi still hasn't learned his lesson.          |

             |   coma under a spell from a sorcerer. His        |
             |   emotions of Fear, Sorrow, Humor, Anger,        |
             |   Reason, and Courage were scattered in his      |
             |   dreams and only when they were united could    |
             |   Mogu be whole again. Mogu's best attribute is  |
             |   his strength, which is not that great, while   |
             |   his other attributes are decent.               |

At the main menu, press down once and select NEW GAME. Select either of the
blank spaces and choose your main hero's name (up to 4 characters). The default
name on my game was Zack but I think his real name is Ryu, so I'll call him
that. Choose your options for Text Speed, Dash, and Music and go down,
selecting END. Back at the main menu screen, select GAME START and choose your
new game file.

       !   The game starts out with a moving statue of a dragon in    !
       !   the middle of the screen. A voice tells you to wake up,    !
       !   calling you a warrior. It says that they need the power    !
       !   the dragon. Flames appear as the dragon disappears and the !
       !   voice says that you will perish if you do not wake up. The !
       !   scene cuts to Ryu, your character, lying in a bed with a   !
       !   woman in blue hovering over him. He proceeds to tell you   !
       !   that the building is engulfed in flames (no shit) and that !
       !   you will perish if you do not get out.                     !

Get out of bed and head up and to the left towards the man in blue. After he
continues on to the left, proceed after him and when you get near him, flames
will appear, making a barrier between you two. The old man will cast a spell
dowsing the flames, and then continue on after him down some stairs. You will
now be in a large room with many people. Talk to the woman at the bottom left
to learn that the building is safe from flames now; she will then move aside.
Now talk to the woman at the bottom middle and she will tell you that a woman
named Sara is their only hope of survival.

       !   against the other dragon families. Their leader, Zog, is   !
       !   plotting to take over the world, starting with the Light   !
       !   Dragons. The old woman in blue comes over and says that    !
       !   Zog is foolish to take on the Light Dragons and the soldier!
       !   opts to go out and fight. Sara then speaks up and says     !
       !   that they are too weak to fight and will be devastated.    !
       !   But the soldier insists to fight and Sara is forced to     !
       !   him into stone. The Chief does not understand why she did  !
       !   this and gets angered at her actions. Sara then turns the  !
       !   rest of the group into stone all at once. She says that    !
       !   she will take on the Dark Dragons herself, but, before she !
       !   goes, she goes over to your stone body, telling you to "Be !
       !   strong. When you're a warrior, you'll bring peace to this  !

       !   Sara rushes out of the building to the town of Drogen, in  !

       !   Dark Dragons. A couple enemy soldiers rush up to her,      !
       !   capture her, and bring her to their commander, Jade. After !
       !   a small conversation about Jade's duties, Sara conjures    !
       !   some lightning bolts, frightening the soldiers away. Sara  !
       !   then aims for Jade, who acknowledges her power, but it     !
       !   really affect her. Sara strikes a couple more times but    !
       !   Jade is too fast for her. Jade then mentions that the Dark !
       !   Dragons have the "goddess keys." While still attacking,    !
       !   Sara asks what they plan to do with the Tyr, the goddess,  !
       !   but before answering, Jade strikes back at Sara. The fight !
       !   continues on as Sara launches a fireball at Jade, who      !
       !   isn't affected by it. Jade asks if that is all she's got,  !
       !   and the view is shifted back up to the house you are in    !
       !   as the story appears on the screen...                      !

As this is going on, you see the soldiers followed by Jade walking toward the
house - an obvious indication that Jade is victorious and Sara has fallen in
battle. Afterwards, the scene cuts to inside the large house where everyone
becomes un-petrified and looks around, startled. The villagers wonder where
Sara is and want to go fight for her, but the old woman says that would not be
wise. The chief, however, believes that you are the mythical Dragon Warrior and
trusts that you will save the world. He makes a chest appear in the center of
the room and tells you to use the equipment in it. You will now have control of
Ryu.

Take the 300GP from the chest above and then head down and out of the large
building. View the destructed city and proceed to a small house to the lower
left. Enter it and save at the Dragon Lord shrine. If you want, head left over
to the shops and buy an herb and any equipment you wish, though none is really
necessary right now. There is nothing more to do in this ruined town so head
out to the world map.

Enemies: Slime, Flea, Bulla

Out here, walk around to get accustomed to the area and level up Ryu to around
four or five if you have the patience. I would wait, however, as the first
dungeon has monsters that give much better amounts of EP. The Slimes are
plentiful out here and are very easy to kill. The Bullas are strong but aren't
that tough to kill. Watch out for the Fleas, however, as they are fast and have
a pretty high attack. In groups of two or three, these things can be deadly.
Luckily, they give a fair amount of EP and GP. If you are running low on HP,
head back to the large house in the center of Drogen and talk to the old woman
who will heal you. Try and save up enough GP to buy a Sabre and any other
equipment you want before proceeding onward on your quest.

From the town of Drogen, head west then north across a stone bridge. When you
reach a corner, head east for a short ways and you should see the city of
Camlon.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You will find that the city of Camlon is just as ruined as Drogen. Talk to the
villagers to find out that the city has been recently invaded by the Dark
Dragons and that the castle has been "occupied by putrid monsters." Before
anything, head to the Dragon Shrine, the only open building in the entire place
aside from the castle, located in the left-center of the city. Now talk to the
royalty up north standing outside the castle and you will learn that they need
a strong fighter to rid the castle of the evil monsters. Hey, maybe you should
do it! Enter the castle.

CAMLON CASTLE
Enemies: Beak, Creep, Gloom, P.Bug
Items: 70GP(x2), BronzSD, Herb(x5), SuedeCP, Visor, Antdt(x2), 150GP

The path in here is very linear as many rocks block other paths. Head up, left,
and up again with the path and you should see a small blue pond. You can drink
from it as many times as you want to replenish your HP. Continue right past the
spring and head north to the upper wall. Go right from here and then south
through an opening down to two chests each containing 70GP. Continue heading
east past another recovery spring. From here, go down with the path and then
head back up the other side of the wall. Keep heading north to a staircase and
take it down.

In this area, press A at the purple doors you see to make them open and take
the BronzSD and Herb from the chests. Head east from here to another set of
purple doors and open them to get the Gauntlet and Herb from these two chests.
Equip both the Gauntlet and the BronzSD on Ryu and proceed north and up the set
of stairs. Back on the floor you started, head south all the way to another set
of stairs leading back down to the lower level. This area looks exactly like
the previous lower-level room, except you are coming from the opposite side
(and the candles by the stairs). Head down and open the purple doors to grab
the SuedeCP and another Herb. Head over to the right and grab yet another Herb
and a Visor from these chests behind the purple doors. Equip both the SuedeCP
and the Visor on Ryu and continue on up the stairs to the right.

On this floor, head south, west, and then north with the path to a chest. This
chest triggers a "Sproing" (whatever the hell that is) and you magically
recover all HP and AP, which is convenient. You also get an Antdt. Now proceed
west past some stairs to another chest that triggers a "Dark Mist," causing you
to lose AP (which doesn't really matter because you don't know any magic yet
anyway). You get another Antdt for your troubles. Now head back east and take
the stairs up to the next room. Make sure you're healed up and save because
your first boss battle is up ahead. Walk up and a man will tell you that you
have no reason to be in his castle. Suddenly, a large frog appears and taunts
you saying that you can't drive him out, implying that he is a demon. You then
battle.

                          |   Boss Battle: FROG   |
         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Frog has four abilities. The attacks where he spits   |
         |   something at you and when he lashes his tongue at you |
         |   aren't very powerful and do only about 6-8 damage.    |
         |   His body slam is a bit more powerful and can do 12    |
         |   damage to your character, so be wary of this. He also |
         |   has the ability to recover 10 HP.                     |
         |        .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.        |
         |   This battle is quite easy as it is basically just hit |
         |   and be hit with the occasional Slams and Cntrs thrown |
         |   in there with some luck. If your hero is around level |
         |   five, you will probably be lowered to almost no HP    |
         |   before the end of the battle. Once your HP gets to    |
         |   around 15, use an Herb to replenish your HP and       |
         |   continue to attack.                                   |
         |        .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.        |
         |   500 EP and 350 GP acquired.                           |
         o---------------------------------------------------------o

As a result of your battle, Ryu should level up a couple of times or more
depending on the level you are at. A message tells you that the foul air has
cleared up in the castle and the screen flashes, apparently signifying the
removal of monsters that were occupying the castle. Head over to the left and
grab the Herb and the 150GP in the two chests here, then make your way out of
the castle, following the linear path out.

_.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-

Upon exiting the castle, the royalty standing outside marvel at your success in
ridding the castle of the evil, acknowledging that you are not a false hero.
They notice a scar on you, saying that it is familiar. Just then, the screen
shakes from an earthquake and the royalty mention that the Dark Dragons must
have the Quake Control. They tell you that there is a hidden palace in the
Nanai dungeon. They want you to go there and find the control to put an end to
the earthquakes. Save again at the Dragon Shrine before exiting the city.

Enemies: Slime, Flea, Bulla

Back out in the World map, you will encounter the same enemies as before,
though they should be much easier to defeat this time around. It's time to make
your way to the kingdom of Nanai. From the city of Camlon, head left along the
strip of land until you reach a small beach to the south. Head north from here
and then right across the stone bridge. Continue heading east a short ways
until you come to some stone steps. Take these steps north and head east again
across another bridge. When you see an opening to the south, take it to a dirt
clearing. Once you reach the sea, head east again to the kingdom of Nanai.

Do not enter the city during the daytime, however, as there are guards guarding
the entrance and will not let you through, believing that you are an intruder.
Wait until the sky darkens, at nighttime, to enter the city, when some of the
guards are sleeping, allowing you to make your way through the city to its
dungeon.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=

Items: 150GP(x2)

When you enter the kingdom at nightfall, you will notice that the guard at the
entrance is sound asleep, giving you a way into the city. You will also notice
that some of the guards in the city are still awake. If they catch you in their
sight, you will be kicked out of the city, so you will have to avoid these
while you make your way around. Head north into the town, saving at the Dragon
Shrine here. The Inn to the left is open, but there is no innkeeper so you
cannot heal up. Instead, make your way west past the Inn and start heading
north. Head east again as soon as you can (you will be behind the Inn) and make
your way through the guards all the way to a pillar structure.

Now head north past a small house to a larger house at the top of the city and
enter it. Grab the 150GP from each of the chests here and exit the house. Head
east as far as you can, to the moat surrounding the castle, and south as far as
you can from here, to the back of a small house. You should notice that a
sleeping guard blocks the pub just to the east of the house. If you go all the
way east and up north, the weapons and armor shop is open, if you want to
upgrade anything, though it isn't really necessary. Anyways, from here head
east one step from the moat and head north all the way to the castle. In here,
open the blue doors ahead of you and take the steps down to the dungeon of
Nanai, Gaia Temple.

GAIA TEMPLE
Enemies: Beak, Creep, Gloom, P.Bug
Items: Antdt, 650GP, B.Stn, ArmPad, 70GP, F.Stn, Cure

Head down a couple more sets of stairs to reach the open, underground area
surrounded by a strange orange aura. The path in this short dungeon isn't very
linear though it is not ambiguous at all either. The enemies are the same as in
Camlon castle so you should have too much difficulty in here. Your HP might get
low, as you haven't healed in a while so use an Herb whenever necessary to
restore your health. From the stairs, head south down a ramp then east across a
bridge to a chest with an Antdt. Now head back west and then south a ways until
you spot a ramp to the left and the right. Take the left one back up north to a
chest with a nice 650GP. Head back south and, instead of taking the eastern
ramp, head even further east to another ramp and take it up to a chest with a
B.Stn. Now you can head back and take the middle ramp north and up another one.
Head east across a wooden bridge and then north across another one to a
staircase. Take it down to the next area

Take a couple more staircases down and you will come to another open area that
looks very much like the one before. Head down one ramp and make you way east
across a small bridge, taking the ramp here up and east to a chest containing
an ArmPad. Equip it on your hero and head down a couple ramps to the darkest
colored ground where another chest lies with a measly 70GP. From here, make
your way as far left as you can go and then south over a bridge. Head east, up
a ramp and down another bridge. Now head down the ramp here and take the F.Stn
from the chest to the east. Now head back up the ramp and east, up another ramp
to a small plateau with a chest containing a Cure. After getting off the
plateau, continue east and head north across a wooden bridge. From here, head
west down and up a couple ramps to a large staircase and take it down to an
indoor area.

Make your way around and head north. Once you spot a man at a machine, heal up
and save, preparing for a boss battle. Approach the man and he asks who
disturbs his privacy. Like all diabolical genius's plotting to take over the
world, he bluntly tells you his intentions of world domination and says that
you can't stop him. We'll see about that...

                         |   Boss Battle: KNIGHT   |
         o---------------o-------------------------o---------------o
         |   This battle can be pretty tough even at around level  |
         |   eight. His main attack is powerful and his T.Bolt     |
         |   magic strike does about 20 damage, which is about 1/3 |
         |   of your total HP. He also has the ability to recover  |
         |   40 HP, which really sucks. You HP will get low often  |
         |   during this battle so you will need plenty of herbs.  |
         |   Use them when you get to around 10 HP to save your    |
         |   hero from dying that round.                           |
         |        .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.        |
         |   There is not much to say along the lines of strategy  |
         |   in this battle as you cannot really exploit his       |
         |   weaknesses. Start off the battle with the B.Stn and   |
         |   F.Stn that you acquired in the dungeon doing 80 and   |
         |   40 damage, respectively. Knight has a lot of HP,      |
         |   however, so it won't even take away half his health,  |
         |   but it is a good start. Just continue with regular    |
         |   attacks and eventually he fall.                       |

         o---------------------------------------------------------o

After defeating Knight, he either blows up or just vanishes with a large poof
of smoke, it's your call. Head up to the machine that is generating a strange
noise and take the key from it, shutting it down. If you stick around, you will
hear a strange voice that says: "...Run while you can, for I am returning..."
Creepy, kind of. Head over to the flashing blue circle to the east to be
transported out of the city.

Soon after being teleported just outside the kingdom of Nanai, you will see the
city being destroyed. One of the royalty from Camlon will come up to you saying
that the device inside the Nanai castle was causing the earthquakes. He brings
you back to Camlon to speak with the king.

The king acknowledges that you gave up the kingdom of Nanai to destroy the
forces of the Dark Dragons, saying that you area  true hero for making the
tough decision. Another member of the royalty tells you to travel east to
Winlan, where you shall find a cave to another kingdom. There is nothing else
to do here so leave the city.

You probably will want to head back down to Drogen and heal up and stock up on
items there before continuing on your journey. Grab some herbs or apples from
the item shop and anything else you think you might need and also sell some of
your unused armor. Now proceed back to where the kingdom of Nanai once stood
and head east past its ruins. Start heading northeast when you reach some
water. Stay along the cliff edge and take it north to a gap that you can take
up to a grassy area. Follow the dirt path here to the kingdom of Winlan,
ignoring the cave to the left for now.

Items: V.Ptn, Herb(x4), SuedeSH, SuedeHT, Antdt(x2)

Head up a set of stairs inside the city and the Inn will be to your left. Take
a rest here to heal up and then proceed to the Dragon Shrine to the right of
the stairs and save your game here. Now head up the next set of stairs and you
will find the Weapons and Item shops to the left. You really don't need any
other armor or weapons than what you have now, however, but the Item Shop does
have some good stuff. From here head all the way east to a small circular
house. Enter it and take the V.Ptn from the chest in the back and use it on
your Hero to increase his vigor. Now head up a couple smaller sets of stairs,
then west to a large set of stairs up to the castle. In here, head straight up
and talk to the woman there with a guard on wither side of her.

       !   The woman will tell you to wait while she sees if it is    !
       !   alright to see the king. She runs up to Princess Nina and  !
       !   asks her if she should tell the visitor (Ryu) that the     !

       !   She say to keep quiet until they can get the Remedy, which !
       !   may be very difficult to find. One of the guards now runs  !
       !   up and reminds the two women that their visitor is waiting !
       !   and suggests showing him to one of the guest rooms to stay !

       !   assures her that se can take care of herself and proceeds  !
       !   up the stairs to the right. The women is still worried,    !
       !   however, and the guard says that he will find someone to   !
       !   help her and he goes away. The women now returns to Ryu    !
       !   tells him that the king is away and shows you to a bed for !

You now have control of Nina, the princess of Winlan. You can head over and
around to the left and speak with the king and his servants if you wish and
they will tell you that the king was poison after receiving a letter from Zog
and that a wizard from Karma once used that trick before. That's nothing really
important for now so head down the stairs just outside of Nina's room. Back in
the main room, head up and around to the right for a couple chests with Herbs.
Now head back around where the woman and the two guards are and head left and
up from here, opening the door to four chests with a SuedeSH, SuedeHT, Antdt,
and another Herb. Equip the Suede items on Nina and head back to the center of
the room.

Now head down the stairs at the northeast corner of the room to an underground
area. Head to the southwest room in this area and grab the Antdt and Herb from
the chests here. Now head back to the main room and make your way out of the
castle. You can talk to sleeping Ryu if you wish and find that he mutters
"S...a...r...a..." in his sleep. A girlfriend maybe? Anyways, proceed out of
the castle. Back outside in the city, head to the weapons shop and exchange
your ShortRP and Dress for a BronzRP and SuedeGN. Save again at the Dragon
Shrine and exit the city.

Enemies: Beak, Creep, Gloom

Walk up a couple steps in the cave and you will be approached by two guards who
accompany you through the cave, thankfully too, as Nina lacks firepower.
Proceed north through the cave to a little peninsula surrounded by water. Head
up a ramp and down the stairs here. Head down another set of stairs to another
water-filled area. Go down the ramp to the left and head around to the right
for a Cure in the chest. Continue east and head down and around another
obstruction for a SuedeGN in a chest. Now head up the two ramps to the left to
a chest with 150GP. Now head down the ramps, left, then up on a small strip of
land. Head up the ramp here and grab the 70GP in the chest. Go back down the
ramp and over to the left for an I.Ore in the chest here.

Proceed back around to the left and up to the stairs where you first entered
the room. Head north up a ramp and across a rope bridge. Grab the Herb in the
chest here before continuing on east across another bridge. Go north across yet
another bridge, west, and down a couple ramps to a chest with another Herb.
Head back up the ramp and continue on west. Pass one ramp heading up and take
the one just past it down to a narrow strip of land. Head north on this strip
to a chest with a B.Stn and make you way back south and up the ramp. Head up
the ramp you passed before to a staircase. In this enclosed area, head north
then west to chest with a C.Stn before going up the stairs to the right. From
here, head straight down and out of the cave.

Items: Map, ProtnB

Save at the Dragon Shrine here just to the left of the Inn, then rest at the
Inn to replenish your health and AP. Now head to the house just northeast of
the Inn (the one with smoke coming out the chimney). Enter it and drop down the
hole in the room. You should notice a configuration of jars to the left in this
room blocking a hallway. They are configured in this order:

                                   (3)(4)
                                   (2)
                                      (1)

To unblock the hallway, move jar 1 left, jar 4 up, and jar 3 to the left so
that they look like this (though jar 3 will be blocked by the wall):

                                      (4)
                                (3)
                                   (2)
                                   (1)

Now walk through to another jar and push it back once, then press A at it to
receive a Map. Now head up the stairs at the bottom of the room and you will be
back out on the World Map. Press Start out here to view the Map that you just
found. Now head back into the city and enter the tall house in the upper-right
corner of the city. Head up the stairs in here and take the ProtnB from the
chest of drawers here. Now head out the west exit of the city.

see an opening to the south. Head south and west through here, then south again
when an opening appears. Continue heading south and west until you reach a
corner with a chest containing a Bandage and equip the shield on Nina. Now head
up and around a small alcove of trees and continue heading west until you are
out of the area back on the World Map.

This open tower has many different staircases leading to different areas, but
overall, the area isn't very confusing at all. Head straight forward and you
should see two recovery springs that you may use whenever necessary to
replenish your HP and AP. Go down the stairs in the area between the two
springs and take the two Herbs from the chests in this room. Head back up the
steps and go west then north when you get to the wall. When the wall to the
right ends, head past it and then back down that way. Follow this path to a
staircase up to a chest with an M.Drop.

Head back downstairs and around the wall to the north wall and proceed all the
way east from there. Hug the eastern wall and make your way south to a chest
with another M.Drop. Now head back north and around the wall to the left back
south. You should notice a floating thing blocking a path to another staircase.
Heal up at the spring before talking to him for a mini-boss battle.

         |   allies each round and heal with Nina when anyone gets |
         |   to around 15-20 HP. You actually really don't have to |
         |   heal as there is a recovery spring right next to you, |
         |   but it's your call. When I fought him, he only used   |
         |   his default attack, so I don't know if he has any     |
         |   other attacks. But his normal attacks do around 15    |
         |   damage. He is nothing formidable at all so just keep  |
         |   striking him until he falls.                          |

Heal up at the spring once you have defeated him and proceed up the stairs he
was blocking. Head over to the east wall and south from there. You should see
two staircases down here, the northern one heading up, and the southern one
heading down. Take the northern one to a chest with a Cure, and head back
downstairs, taking the southern staircase to a chest with a Charm. Go back up a
floor and head back north along the eastern wall. Stay along this outer wall as
you go west around the area. Once you reach the southwest corner of the area,
head back up north to a staircase and take it up to another room.

Head north from this staircase through a couple openings to the northern wall.
Follow the western wall and head south through a zigzag path down to a chest
with a Charm. Now proceed back up to the north wall and follow it around east
and south, through another zigzag path to a staircase leading down a floor.
From this staircase, follow the windy path north to an area with two holes in
the floor and a staircase leading up. Take the staircase up to an Herb and
another floor with four holes. Fall down through the upper right one down to a
floor with a single hole to the left. Avoid this and take the staircase here.

In this small room, head south to another staircase, and south again in this
area down a staircase. Go down and around to yet another staircase here and
grab the Life2 in the chest here. Head back up two staircases and you should
notice another floating enemy like Morte over to the right. Go down and around
to this figure and talk to it to enter another small boss battle.

         |   so use the Atk-Up spell on the two soldiers to        |
         |   increase their power. Use Nina to cure each round     |
         |   while the soldiers attack. If more than one ally gets |
         |   low on health, use an M.Drop to heal all. Keep up the |
         |   attacks and she will fall.                            |

Proceed north up the staircase that was previously blocked to get to the top of
the tower. Head west onto a platform to make a bridge appear. Head west across
it, causing it to disappear once you cross it. Head up the stairs here to heal
at the spring and save at the Dragon Shrine. Now head back downstairs and open
the pink doors, stepping on the switch beyond them to make the bridge appear
again. The middle of the three girls to the left will move aside, unblocking
the path to the stairs. Take them downstairs to a small area with a chest
containing a Cure. Proceed right to another staircase and in this room, head
around the wall to another staircase.

You should now be in a dark, cave-type area. Nina says that the remedy should
be in this room, so you should find it quickly and leave. Begin heading south,
but the wizard will appear from the stairs behind you shortly afterwards. The
wizard notices you and releases Xeon Gas into the air, very harmful to the
bird-like species of Winlan. You engage in a "battle" with the wizard where all
your party members are at 1 HP. You are forced to lose as your attacks do
nothing to the wizard, so just meaninglessly attack as the wizard just stands
there until the battle ends in a cutscene.

Out here, talk to the leader of the group (the one dressed in darker clothing)
and he will tell you to hop onto his back. He, along with three others,
transforms into a bird and you fly off to Karma Tower. Along the way, you are
nearly attacked by dragons, but the birds avoid them. You soon encounter a wall
of three dragons, which you slip by as the three others distract them.

You land on top of the tower as the soldier reverts back to human form and

Shrine here. Now go down another set of stairs here and head over to the left
for another staircase. In this room, proceed over to the right down another
staircase, and head around the wall in this next area to get to this final
staircase. As you approach it, the soldier senses the gas and leaves your
party. Ryu heads down alone into the dark, cloudy area.

Head down and around in this area along the brown path, past one path upwards
to a second up to a chest with a foil, a very strong weapon that strikes all
enemies. Equip it to Ryu and proceed up the path that you passed, preparing for
a boss battle. As you head up the steps, the wizard notices that you are a
warrior from the Dragon clan, and that the gas won't effect you, so he attacks
you.

The Wizard explodes and disappears after you receive the Remedy from him. Nina
comes up to you and thanks you just before she collapses into Ryu's arms. Back
at the top of the tower, the soldier thanks you and gives you and Nina a lift
back to Winlan, accompanied by a fleet of other birds. You land just outside
the city and proceed after Nina to the castle to see the king.

king lies in his bed with Nina at his side. Talk to her.

Nina joins your party and you are free to set off. Exit the castle and rest at
the Inn before heading back to the castle to get to the tunnel. Back in the
castle, head to the stairs in the northeast corner of the large area. Head down
past one room on the right down to a hallway and take it right and up to a
couple of guards. Talk to them and they will acknowledge your authorization to
use the bridge. Head east across the bridge out to the World Map.

Back out at a different part of the World Map, you will find that there are a
couple new monsters out here, though you should still have no problem with
them. The Zombies can be quite tough, especially in pairs, however. Head
southeast along the dirt path here and you should notice a gap in the trees to
the right. You can try to enter here but a message will tell you that a huge
tree is blocking your path. So keep heading southeast along the dirt path and
down a ramp. From here, head southeast still to a town on the western bank of a
dried up river.

Heal up at the Inn at the northwest corner of the town and save at the Dragon
Shrine just to the right of it. Stop at the Weapons Shop if you wish to upgrade
any equipment. You can buy a Scythe for Ryu, though I favor the Foil that he
already has as it attacks all enemies. Now, remember that I.Ore you got in Aura
Cave a while back? Head to the southern area of the city where four houses are
and enter the southeastern one, with the smoke coming out the chimney. Talk to
him and he tells you that he will make a saw if you give him the I.Ore. Say yes
and you will receive a saw. Now exit the city.

Enemies: G.Knight, S.Rider, Stool, Zombie
Items: Herb, T. Drop(x2), Life, Wrist

Some of the enemies in here, namely the S.Riders, can be pretty tough, as they
have relatively high health and defense, but luckily, they give good rewards.
Anyways, head north and west with the black path. When it forks shortly
afterwards, take the lower path and follow it southwest, west and then north to
another fork. Take the right path for a chest with an Herb. Now head back and
take the other path upwards as far as you can go to another chest with a
T.Drop. Now head back south and take the first path east that you come to.
Follow it east and when it coincides with other paths, continue heading
southeast down to a small alcove with two chests.

Grab the Life and T.Drop from these. Now take the lower-eastern path out of
this alcove and follow it up north. When the path comes to a fork, continue on
the northern one and take it up to a chest with a Wrist. Equip it to either
Nina or Ryu and head out of this small alcove, taking a northwestern path.
Follow it as it zigzags up and down, but head generally northwest, heading
north when the path splits. Now follow this narrow path east to a stone
building and enter it.

Enemies: Bowman, Lancer, Midget, S.Rider, WarHog, Zard
Items: LongSD, Life(x2), T.Drop(x3), Herb(x4), Acorn, Life2, WolfHT,

As you step into this building, you will notice two guards blocking the path
ahead of you. Talk to them and the Bowman and Lancer will challenge you. This
isn't a boss fight, nor even a mini-bass fight really, as they aren't too
challenging and you fight more than one set of these guys through the fort.
Simply defeat them and they will be gone, unblocking the path. Walk ahead
through another doorway and a trap in the floor will open, sending you down a
floor. These traps are abundant here, but I will let you know where they are
ahead of time. Anyways take the LongSD, T.Drop, and a couple Life items from
the chest down here and head back up the stairs. As to whether you should equip
the LongSD, it is up to you. The foil attacks all characters, making it much
more powerful at times, but the LongSD has +8 more attack power.

From the stairs, head north through another hallway and back south with the
path. When the path forks, take the north path as the south path has another
trap. You may be tempted to go south because of the chests, but you can get
them by going around. So head up and west and you should spot another pair of
guards. Before you fight them, switch Ryu back to the Foil if you have the
LongSD equipped so that the battle is easier. Head up through the doorway they
were blocking and go south past the stairs to the area with the chest. Take the
Herb, T.Drop, Acorn, and Life2 from them and head back up, taking the stairs
down a floor.

In this area, go down the stairs to the right and grab the WolfHT, T.Drop, and
Herbs from the chests down here. Just as a forewarning, the lower-left chest,
containing the WolfHT, triggers a Fire trap, doing 50 points of damage to you.
Now, go back upstairs and take the eastern path, as the northern path leads to
a trap hole. Follow the windy path up and around to a chest with an Herb. Now
head west along the path, pass a doorway to your right, and go south once you
reach the wall. Grab the Herb in the chest here and head north and then east to
a doorway with three guards blocking it. Before, battling them, heal up because
you have three battles ahead of you without any breaks. Defeat the two Lancers
and the Bowman first and the old man behind them will thank you for saving him.
He will ask you if you want him to lead you to their weapons. He won't take no
for an answer so just say yes and walk right into his trap. He will trap you in
a cage and send his fiend on you for one boss battle.

         |   attack per round, but occasionally, both heads will   |
         |   attack. Each head has two attacks, a regular strike   |
         |   and a projectile launched from their mouths. Both do  |
         |   around 12 damage, which isn't anything too special.   |

After the battle, the old man will be astonished that you defeated his beast.
Suddenly, an arrow flies across the screen, hitting the switch that lowers the
gate to the cage. A wolf-man then runs up and tells you that he rescued the
chief from the back. The old man then transforms into a general and battles you
along with the wolf-man named Bo.

         |   two rounds with your new ally, Bo. Bo has some nice   |
         |   elemental attacking spells with him already and you   |
         |   should exploit them against General. His weakness     |
         |   seems to be lightning, so use Bo's Fry spell twice,   |
         |   doing 80 damage to General each time. He should die   |
         |   at or before this second strike. Just attack or heal  |
         |   with your other party members.                        |

Once you defeat General, he will mention that you have won the battle but not
the war, as the river is still dry. He then walks off (I thought you just
defeated him??). The chief then tells you that they were searching for the Ring
and suggests that you find a way to remove the rock before he runs off. That
was kind of random, as he doesn't explain anything to you. Now Bo comes up to
you and wants to join your party, as Zog is his enemy as well. Once he joins
your party, equip the WolfHT and make your way out of the fort. The path out
should be pretty easy to find.

These woods can be a bit trickier to find the exit, so I'll help you out. Head
west and then south to a fork. Take the western path as far as you can then
head south as far as you can. Follow the path as it goes east and then south
out of the area.

Make sure to enter the city during the daytime at first so you can talk to the

will talk of zombies and a WtrJr and something about the Cleansing Water that
can save the soil. Now head up to the tall house at the northeastern corner of
the city and talk to the old man in green there. He will tell you to get rid of
the zombies in exchange for information about Agua. Well, they only appear at
nighttime, so exit the city until it becomes dark and reenter it.

You should see an old woman to the left, a zombie to the left of her, and a
zombie walking in a rectangular path just to the north. Talk to the woman here
and she will tell you that it is the hour of the zombies. She will then ask you
if you want the WtrJr to cleanse the soil. Her zombie husband will then push up
a tombstone, revealing a hole. He then tells you that the Cleansing Water is in
a cave to the west and to use the WtrJr under the tomb. Walk around and fall
down the hole, grabbing the WtrJr and the Herb in the chests here. Now exit up

The only new enemies in here are the Ameblobs and the Mages. The Mages aren't
anything too special but the Ameblobs can be annoying as they have pretty high
HP and often come in groups of two or three even. They don't even give good EP!
Anyways, when you first walk up in this blue-walled cave, you will see three
paths before you. Take the right path to an Herb in a chest and head back west,
taking the left path at the fork. When the path heads north, stay to the right
when the path forks for a chest with another Herb. Now head down and around,
taking the left path up to a chest with a NiceHT. I'd equip it to Nina, since
Ryu should have the Visor and Bo has his WolfHT. Head east from here and then
southeast with the path until you come to a corner. Head north from here as far
as you can, then east with the linear path until you come to some stairs.
Before you take them down, however, take the southern path here east and south
to an F.Stn. Now take head back up and head down the staircase.

From the staircase, head south and follow the path around to a chest with an
Herb at a dead end. Now go back around to the staircase and take the path
north. When you come to a fork, take the northeastern path to a T.Drop in a
chest and then head back, taking the northern path. Head up, east, and then
down all the way to a staircase, which you should take. On this floor, take the
upper path first, following it west to a staircase. Head up this and grab the
BronzHT (equip to Ryu) and the Apple in the chests here. Go back down the
stairs and head east, down, and around to another staircase, this time heading
down. You will be on an island surrounded by water. Head down into the water
and press A to fill your WtrJr and receive the Cleansing Water. A message will
now tell you that your hero hurries off to Romero.

Now simply head up and grab the Tablet, Herb, Antdt, Cure, and 900GP from the
five chests here, then exit the Chief's house. Visit the Weapons Shop here and
buy a ChainML each for Ryu and Bo and a Gown for Nina. The SilkGN costs more
but actually has worse statistics than the Gown. Odd... Once you're done
upgrading, stock up on any items if necessary at the Item Shop and rest at the
Inn. Before you leave, save at the Dragon Shrine to the left of the Inn, then
exit the town.

Position Bo in the front of your party again, if he is not there already, and
head north from Romero into the trees. Then head east-northeast from there to a
landmass with a tower on it floating over a lake. Enter the area through the

Walk east across the wide stone bridge here to a large square tile at the end.
Your party will stop and read the inscription on the Tablet that you received
from the chief of Romero. Slowly, the entrance to the tower will drop down from
above. Head north into the entrance.

AGUA TOWER
Enemies: G.Knight, S.Rider, WarHog, Zombie
Items: Herb(x2), Life2, Apple, Acorn(x2), SunHT, IronSH, ThiefCL, HairBand,
       Bracelet

The enemies here are nothing that you haven't faced before and are generally
some of the weaker enemies you have faced. You shouldn't have too much trouble
with them, but they can wear you down with time. Make sure to stay healed using
Herbs or Nina's spells. Upon entering the tower, head straight forward and up a
staircase to a floor with an abundance of chests. The door ahead of you here is
locked so head south onto a platform the will take your party across a large
gap in the floor. You can't access the chests to the left yet so head west
along the path, past a corridor north, to a chest with, what else, an Herb.
Backtrack and take the northern pathway straight up to a chest with a Life2.
Again, backtrack and take a path left and up to two more chests with and Apple
and an Acorn. Now continue ahead on this path up and east to a staircase and
take it up a level.

You should see another locked door to your left and a large gap south of you
with a floating platform on it. Step on the platform and it will carry you
across to an island with three more floating platforms beside it. First take
the upper-left one across a short ways to a smaller island. Take the SunHT here
and equip the SunHT to Ryu if you wish, but it is quite heavy and detracts from
your ACTIVE points. But anyways, take the floating platform at the upper-right
corner of the small island back to a peninsula of the area you started on. Walk
up and around to the platform that takes you to the main island and take the
lower-right platform to some more land. Head down to a chest with an IronSH and
equip it to Ryu before taking the floating platform above you to the top area.
Take the platform to your left once again to the main island and take the
lower-left platform this time. When you reach solid ground, head down and
around to a chest with a ThiefCL. It's a very good piece of armor for Ryu so
equip it to him for a nice boost in DEFENSE. Now have the platform north of you
carry you up to the area where you started, but on the southern side of the
locked door. Head west from there up a flight of stairs.

On this level, there is another locked door to your right (if you can't tell by
now, they essentially will serve as shortcuts once opened) and a chest to the
left with an Acorn. Take the item and take the platform to the right across to
an island much like the one in the previous room, but this time, with only two
connecting platforms. Take the left one first to an area with a HairBand in a
chest. Equip the headwear to Nina then take the platform above it to a small
island. Grab the Herb in the chest here then have the platform to the left
carry you back to the main island. Now take the right platform and head down
and around to a chest with a Bracelet and equip the shield to Nina. Now since
the left platform here takes you to an area you've visited before, take the
upper one. Once you reach land, head up and around to a staircase, which you
should take.

The western path here leads to a locked door, so take the eastern path down to
a platform and ride it across to a small platform with a glowing orb at the top
of a pillar. Approach the pillar and heal up to prepare for a boss battle.
Press A at the pillar and monster will appear, telling you that it guards the
Key. It then asks you if you want to test your strength and enters battle with
you.

         |   This battle should be pretty easy if you're around    |
         |   level 13 or 14. Make sure that Bo is at least level   |
         |   12, however, as you will need his 30 AP to cast       |
         |   attack spells. The Wisp itself is not too menacing.   |
         |   It either attacks each party member with an attack    |
         |   that does about 10-15 damage or a single attack doing |
         |   slightly more damage. That's basically all there is   |
         |   in terms of the Wisp's arsenal. It is nothing         |
         |   formidable but bear in mind that its attacks do more  |
         |   damage to Bo for his lower defense reasons.           |

         |   Continue to attack with Ryu and cast Fort on Bo with  |

After defeating the Wisp, he congratulates you and tells you that you deserve
the Key. Once the guardian disappears, search the pillar and the glowing orb
will turn into the KngKey and make its way to your inventory. Now ride the
platform to the north and head down the stairs. On this floor take the just to
the southeast over to the west and take the stairs here down a floor. Here,
head down to the near platform and ride it across the gap to the other side of
the room. Head north and west from here and head down the staircase. Now on
this final floor, take either the right or left path around the room and have
the platform at the south take you north to another staircase. Now head south
from here out of the tower.

_.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-

Simply head east across the stone bridge out of the area.

Well after that ordeal, you'll probably want to heal up and save. So put Bo
back in front and walk almost directly east out of the forest. Make your way to
Tartar by following the dirt path southeast and down a ramp, then southeast
again from there to the town. Rest at the Inn at the west side of the town and
then save at the Dragon Shrine just to the right of there. Exit the town and it
is time to seek the Stone Robot that must be operated with the KngKey. So from
Tartar, head north then east across the stone bridge, and then immediately
north again up a ramp. Follow the dirt path here northeast up to a larger ramp
and head up this along a strip of land until you reach a fork at the edge of
the cliff. Head east along this ledge until you come to a ramp and take this
down a level. Immediately head east from here to another ramp heading down and
walk up to the massive robot structure through its left leg.

Enemies: Midget, Zombie
Items: Herb, BronzHT, Acorn, Life2, Mrbl1

Again, the enemies in here are nothing special and are generally some of the
weaker enemies that you have faced in the past (or they just seem weak now).
Just use them to gain EP and GP. In this first room filled with weeds and a
couple columns in the center, head up the stairs at the northwest corner. Head
up a couple more flights of stairs in two small rooms after and you should be
in another room with a path leading to the right. Head that way and grab the
Herb and BronzHT in the little alcove to the south. Continue on the path left
and head up the stairs adjacent to the wall. In this room, you should see a
blue circle to the left. It doesn't do anything right now so just head
southeast to where some soldiers are standing in front of a massive heart.
Approach the man in front and he will tell you to give him the key as he
controls the Stone Robot followed by a mini-boss battle.

         |   should be called a mini-boss battle. This possibly    |
         |   may be the same general you fought at the Dark D.     |
         |   Fort, but I am not sure. Anyhow, he is much easier    |
         |   this time around. Either have Ryu or Bo, with his Fry |
         |   spell, take out the Lancers in the first two rounds   |
         |   and then just focus your attacks on the General.      |
         |   Their weaknesses are Thunder if you want to use Bo to |
         |   exploit this. Just continue to attack, having Nina    |

After the battle, walk up to the stone thing at the top of the stairs here and
press A at it. After a short pause, a message will tell you that the Key works.
The screen will shake and the heart will start to flash red and white,
indicating that it is working. You should notice that the blue circle on the
ground below you is also flashing now. Step down onto it and you will be
teleported to exactly where you were standing before. Now head up to the blue
circle that you first saw at the top of the room and you will be transported to
a small hallway. Head north past one blue circle (it leads back to the heart)
and follow the windy hallway to another blue circle and jump on that. In this
separated part of the heart room, head north and then around south to another
teleport circle. Take the acorn in the chest here then step back on the blue
circle.

Back in front of the massive heart, head back up to the circle at the top of
the room. Again, bypass one teleporter in this hallway and make your way to the
other at the end of the path. This time around, take the circle at the top of
this corridor to get transported to another hallway. Head north and then back
south when you can to a teleport circle and take the Life2 and Mrbl1 in the
small room you are transported to. Step back on the circle here to get
teleported back to the hallway you were just at. Now head north, around the
first blue circle, and around south to an open area with two columns. Hit the
teleport circle to the right and then another to the north in this new,
enclosed hallway. You should now be in a room with a huge tablet thing up
north. Head up to it and press A, and again, a message will tell you that the
Key works.

       !   cuts to the widescreen shot of the robot as a powerful     !
       !   shoots from its eye. The rock is shown exploding as the    !
       !   river rushes forth. Back inside the behemoth, the party is !

After you regain control of the team, hit the teleporter at the bottom of the
room to get back to the room with the huge heart. Now head down the stairs to
the northeast, and down some more stairs to the east in this room. Head down a
couple more flights of stairs and make your way south out of the Robot.

You will see the river flowing down the previously dried up area to your left.
Now that you have done the chief's will by destroying the rock, go and see him
in Tantar. Head south down a couple ramps then east from it across a stone

In the town head west across a couple bridge and some grass. Then go south and
east to the tall house on a little island where the chief lives. Head up and
talk to him and he will tell you that you should look for the Ring, which is in
a cave upstream. He will then push aside his seat, revealing a hole in the
floor. He tells you that the key is down below, so drop down and head north up
a hallway here to a couple of chests with an Herb and the Key. Now head back up
the stairs to the south then exit the house. Take some time here to rest at the
Inn and, as always, save at the Dragon Shrine. Now leave the town.

The path is very linear in here. Head north as far as you can, up a couple of
ramps and across a rope bridge to the upper wall. If you were here before the
lake was drained, water was previously blocking the stairs here. Head down them
and up the other side to the sole chest here containing a W.Ptn. Use it to
increase someone's WISDOM then continue east, down some stairs, and follow the
path out.

Enemies: Ameblob, Blurb, WarHog, Zard, Zombie
Items: Life, Life2, 2000GP, Herb, Acorn, SkySH, Ring

As in the previous dungeons, the enemies in this area are pretty much the same
old beasts. The Ameblob is back, however, and they can be a pain in groups. The
path is extremely linear so you should have no trouble in this short cave. Once
you enter the cavern, head directly north to a locked door, which you can now
open with the Key you recently procured. Walk past the blue teleport circle
here and head down the stairs in between the pillars. Head down a couple more
staircases in the next two small rooms and in the next room, follow the linear
path east, south, and east again to a staircase and take it upstairs.

In this water-filled room, head down the stairs into the water and head west
and south from there down a waterfall. Down in this area, head south through a
couple islands down to another island and climb up the steps at the south end
of it. Take the Life in the chest here, head back down the steps to the south,
and go up the ones just to the east. Follow this strip of land northwest to
another set of stairs. Head down these into the water and make your way north
up some more steps. On this land, head further south from the stairs here and
take the Life2 from the chest here before heading down the stairs.

Back in an enclosed area, follow the linear path west, north, and then west
again to another staircase and take it up a floor. In the next two rooms, head
up the staircases nearby until you come to another room with some water. Before
heading down the steps to the right, head north to a chest with 2000GP. Take
the money then head down the steps into the water, taking it north, then east
at the fork. Head up the first stairs you come to and take the Herb in the
chest at the west side of this small piece of land. Now head back down the
stairs into the water and up the set just to the east.

Head straight south from here, pass one path heading left and take the second
to a chest with an Acorn. Now head back north and take the first path west and
south down some stairs. Make your way south through the water, east, and then
south down another waterfall. Wade southeast and head north up some stairs
here. Make your way up a couple ramps here to a chest with a SkySH. Grab it and
hook Nina up with it before heading back down to the water. Now continue on
east through the water and up a second set of steps to an area with a teleport
circle, three pillars, and a blue chest. Take the Ring from the blue chest and
you will activate the teleporter. Step on it then head directly south out of
the cave.

Wait, something's different here. There are two citizens blocking your path on
the bridge. Talk to either of them and they will say that they are ready for
the ceremony, and then move out of your way. Head to the chief's tall house
near the center of the city and you will find that it is all decorated up. Talk
to the chief in here (the middle left one) and he will tell you that the
wedding will take place tomorrow. The screen will go black for a moment then
you view the wedding ceremony for Terry and Amelia. After this seemingly
pointless shindig, the chief will tell you that you can cross the river by
using the Stone Robot. He then mentions that you can find a port in the town on
the other side. You can now leave the house. Rest up at the Inn and save your
progress at the Dragon Shrine before leaving the town.

Enemies: G.Knight, Stool

In here, you must make your way back to the control room of the Robot, where
the large Tablet is. In this first room, head up the stairs at the northwest
corner, and then up a couple more flights of stairs in the next two tiny rooms.
Head east in this room to another set of stairs and head up them. Step on the
blue teleport circle to the left here and follow the linear path in this next
area, past one blue circle, and hit the second. In this hallway, take the
northern teleporter, and then follow the pathway up, around, and down to
another teleporter. Head directly north from here to a blue circle and you will
be teleported to the control room where the General is. Heal up and prepare for
battle as you approach him. The General recognizes that you have the ring, and
says that they'll have to take it away. As you enter battle, his body shines
and morphs into the Gremlin.

         o---------------o--------------------------o--------------o
         |   The Gremlin is pretty hard in my opinion. All he ever |
         |   does is attack, but they do vary. He either attacks   |
         |   with a body slam to one ally, a white projectile to   |
         |   one ally, or a fire attack to each party member. Each |
         |   of these does about 20 damage to each ally, though    |
         |   near double against Bo. Once the Gremlin's visible HP |
         |   reaches zero and he "gets angry," he always uses     |
         |   this attack, and it is quite devastating. The Gremlin |
         |   is strong but nothing you can't defend against.       |

         |   As always, have Ryu attack each round, unless you are |
         |   desperate and need him to use an Herb on someone,     |
         |   which you shouldn't be. Bo's Fry spell does the most  |
         |   damage to the beast so use it until he runs out of    |
         |   AP, then resort to attacking. Have Nina cast Atk-Up   |
         |   on Ryu and Fort on Bo, then use her to attack and     |
         |   cure whenever necessary. Just keep up the onslaught   |
         |   until the Gremlin is defeated. You may also want to   |
         |   use any Stn items or M.Drops you may have if you're   |
         |   finding yourself in trouble later on in the battle.   |

Items: Melon

Head straight ahead into the small shrine, and once inside the building go
directly north and talk to the old man there. He will tell you that you need
proper training to break the seal and let only Ryu alone go ahead. Do not worry
if you aren't healed up. Just head left at the fork and drink from the spring
there to replenish your HP. Now head over to the right path at the fork and
grab the Melon in the chest here. Now head straight up the center and talk to
the green, blinking apparition there. It will enter in battle with you.

         o----------------o------------------------o---------------o
         |   Well it's just Ryu in this battle, so there is not    |
         |   much else you can do but attack and heal whenever     |
         |   necessary. You can defeat this bird at around level   |
         |   15 or so, but you just have to time when you heal     |
         |   yourself correctly. Talon strikes first and does      |
         |   about 7-10 damage per attack. So use an Herb whenever |
         |   you drop to about 20 HP, at the least. You may also   |
         |   want to use a Cure or the Melon you just found. Just  |
         |   outlast Talon before it can outlast you, healing at   |
         |   the right times, and it will be over before you know  |
         |   it. For some added damage, use any Stn items that you |
         |   might still have.                                     |

After the battle, Talon congratulates you and tells you that your training is
complete. A light flashes and some sort of energy comes to you. Before the
apparition leaves, he tells you to use your new powers to restore peace to the
world. You now have the first three dragon spells: SnoDr, FlmDr, and ThrDr.
It's about time too as your AP has been going to waste. Make your way out of
the area back to the World Map.

Well there is nothing more you can do in this new area, so it's time to make
your way through the trees. Switch Bo to the lead of your party and head
southwest from the Dragon Shrine through the trees. Pass a little open hole in
the woods for now and enter the cave down near the mountains.

In this short, red-grounded cave, head south as far as you can then continue on
the linear path as it heads west and south. Upon reaching a corner, again head
west. You will soon come to a fork, where you should take the southern path
instead of continuing west. Follow this path all the way out of the cave on the
other side of the mountains.

Back out here, you will encounter the same enemies that you fought when you
first started the game. That's pretty lame, but at least you can always run
from battle successfully, unless of course you want to earn 1 EP and 4 GP from
a Slime. But anyways, head south around a large rock to a city on the lake to
the west and enter it.

       Antdt, Life(x3), S.Ptn, W.Ant, V.Ptn, Mrbl1, 5000GP

When you first step up in this city, the two guards at the entrance will tell
you to halt, calling you an intruder. They will place you under arrest and
place you in jail. Once you're in jail, the guard tells you that no one steals
their treasure and to think about it in while you're in jail. Well what is a
good RPG without getting arrested and spending time in jail? Your cell is
actually pretty nice. Head up to the sink in the upper right corner of the cell
and examine it for a PrisnCL, a weaker armor that boosts the wearer's FATE by
20. I'd equip it to Bo, as he has the lowest FATE of all your party. Now head
over and talk to the sleeping inmate in the bed. After a pause, he will wake up
and asks who you are and how you got here. Say yes when he offers to help you
and he'll run over and open the cell. Wow, that was a little too easy. Simply
head around to the stairs and then south out the exit.

You need to avoid the guards here, or else they'll throw you in jail again and
change the lock. That doesn't really matter as your fellow inmate will break
you out as many times as you get thrown in. But anyways, you'll probably want
to take a rest, save, and upgrade some of your equipment. Head through the door
just to the left to get to the Weapon and Item Shops. I suggest buying a Rapier
and Tiara for Nina, a LongBW for Bo, and a BroadSD for Ryu. Sell back some of
your old equipment to regain some dough and then head over to the Item Shop and
stock up on any items you want. Also, buy a Rod1 and some Worms for Ryu, and
then get the Vitamn and the Pouch, as you will soon need them. Now exit back
out to the shiny city. Head south to a tree, then east to a wall. From here go
north into the Inn and heal up. Once you've rested, head southwest into the
Dragon Shrine and save your progress.

Now, head west out to the dock and talk to the man in front of the ship. He
will tell you that Ross, the rich man, owns the ship. So head back east to the
center of the city and go north up some stairs, staying as far west as you can
to avoid detection by the guard. Head all the way north and into the large
manor up here. Make your way through the statues and columns up to an area
where a man is walking around. Talk to him and he will tell you that if you
help him he will let you borrow his ship. He will tell you that his daughter is
locked in a safe and he wants you to save her. Well that doesn't give you very
much information but you don't really need the ship until later. Head up the
stairs to the south and on this floor, head west into a bedroom and then north
through a small hole in the wall. Grab the Cure and G.Tiara in the chests here
then head back to where the stairs are. Now head north into a hallway and take
it east to the northeastern room. Search the drawers here for a nice 2000GP,
and then leave the building.

It's time to make some money. Head just southeast into the large building
nearby. Head north past the stairs and examine the chest of drawers here for an
L.Ptn. There is a chest to the left, but don't take it as you will be caught
and thrown in jail again. Now head up the stairs and on this floor, head around
to the left and take the Cure from the chest here. Return to the stairs and
head southeast from them to a doorway that an old man is blocking. Switch to
Nina and talk to the man. Have Nina fix his aching back and you'll receive a
whopping 20000GP. Now exit this house and make your way west to the other large
manor. Take the Acorn in the chest at the upper-right corner of the room and
then examine the chest of drawers here for a SmartRG. I'd equip this ETC item
to Nina, as it enhances here INTELLIGENCE and MAG DEF.

Now head upstairs and grab the Antdt in the chest to the left and the Life in
the chest of drawers to the right. Now head on downstairs and speak with the
woman at the table. She will tell you that her son left for the forest and
hasn't returned. So leave now and head to the southwestern of the clump of four
manors here. Take the Life and S.Ptn in the chest and drawers on the first
floor then grab the W.Ant and Cure from the chest and drawers up here. Leave
this house and head to the southeastern manor. Do the same routine as the
previous house for a Life and a V.Ptn on the ground floor and a Mrbl1 and
2000GP upstairs. Now leave this house and head back to the shops building just
to the left of the prison. The G.Tiara is weak but hella pricey so sell it for
a nice 10000G. Now head up the stairs to the right here to get to the pub area.
Talk to the man at the table here and he will tell you that he has the hiccups
and needs some Vitamins. Give him the Vitamn and he will thank you by giving
you 5000GP. Finally, save again at the Dragon Shrine and you can exit the
town...for now.

Well you should find the son of that old woman in the northwestern of the four
manors. Head north and back through the Cape Cave to the area surrounded by
trees. Place Bo at the head of your party and make your way northeast through
the trees to that open grassy area that you passed earlier. Enter it.

Talk to one of the fairies here and tell it that you'll make the boy stop
logging so that it will save him. The fairy will say that it will forgive that
foolish human and ask you if you don't want to cut trees. Nina replies that of
course you don't and the fairy tells you to go find the boy. Exit the area and
head east-southeast to a small square of slightly different-shaded grass. Enter
the middle of this square and once in these Fairy Woods, walk up and talk to
either of the fairies beside the spinning boy. The fairy will tell the boy that
he cut a tree that took hundreds of years to grow and to think twice before he
does that again. The spell will be broken now, so talk to the boy and he will
promise to protect nature. You can now leave.

Either way you arrive, head north to the northwestern of the four manors at the
upper part of the gold city. Talk to the woman at the table once again and she
will thank you will a helpful reward of 20000GP. Now, hopefully, through your
various battles and recent moneymaking exploits, you have at least 65000GP with
you to buy the G.Bar from the Item Shop (I had over 75000GP at the time). If
not, you should be very close, so either head back into the Cape Cave and fight
some more battles or sell some more things to the Item Shop, but find a way to
get a G.Bar. Once you've purchased one, exit the town.

Items: ShellHT, Cure

In here, proceed straight ahead to two men blocking your path. Talk to them to
be informed about the thieves in Bleak. They will then step back, allowing you
to continue on. Head northeast and down the stairs here. In this area, head
east and north down a long hallway. When you come to a fork, continue north to
the wall, then proceed along the linear pathway up and around until you come to
another fork. The west/north path leads to a locked door so head east and south
until you come to yet another fork. At this junction, take the western path to
two chests with a ShellHT and a Cure. The ShellHT doesn't fit any of your party
members so just return to the fork and continue south. Follow the path east to
a split and head northwest to a staircase, which you should take upstairs.

Up here, follow the long corridor east to an intersection. Take the northern
path first and follow this long, winding hallway, past a locked door and a
damaged wall, to a ground switch, which lowers a gate, making a little shortcut
to this area for later. Now make your way all the way back to the fork and
continue on south to exit the cave.

In this section east of the mountains, the G.Slime (an off-colored Slime) are
much stronger than any regular enemy you have faced, but they also give nice
rewards. Defeating three of these fiends result in over 3000 EP acquired from
the battle. Try using Thunder attacks on them such as Bo's Fry spell and Ryu
transforming into the ThrDr. Take some time here to level up your party. When
you are in desperate need of some healing, head north from the cave and then
east and south around the lake here. Enter the town near the southeastern side
of the lake.

Items: 5000GP, Herb(x4), Icicle, Life, W.Ant

If you bought the Pouch from the Auria Item Shop as I suggested earlier, enter
the Inn here and take a night's rest. The innkeeper will offer you free
lodging, but while you sleep the innkeeper will try and steal your Pouch. He
apologizes and gives you 5000GP for your troubles. Well, when the morning
comes, you still won't be healed up, so talk to him again and he will give you
a proper rest to heal up. Now leave the Inn and head to the Dragon Shrine to
save your progress. Now take a visit to the Weapons and Items Shops north of
the Inn and upgrade your equipment as well as restock your items. Grab a
MetalSH for Ryu and a WoolRB for Nina and sell anything that you don't have any
use for.

Now head north through the center of the city until you come to two large
houses on either side of you. Head to the left one and go upstairs. On this
floor head over to the right to a room with two chests, each with an Herb. Now
exit and do the same in the house on the right for two more Herbs. Exit this
house and continue north to a larger house and enter this. In this house, head
northwest to an old man in an open room. Talk to him and he will tell you that
someone named Karn could help you to enter the safe in Auria (remember Ross and
his daughter locked in a safe?), but he's in Krypt at the moment. The old man
then mentions that you will need the Icicle to travel in the desert and that he
will trade one for a G.Bar. Give him yours and you will receive the Icicle. Now
head upstairs and follow the same routine as the previous two houses. Head over
to the right and grab the Life and W.Ant in the chests here. Now head back
downstairs, exit the house, and continue south out of the town.

Out here, if you're not taking the time to level up, simply head east-southeast
to a small cave encircled by mountains.

Enemies: Ameblob, Fly

In this brown cave, head straight forward and down some stairs. In this next
area, follow the linear path east, south, and east again to another staircase.
Now in this final area, head east and south along the linear pathway and out
the exit. Upon leaving, Ryu uses the Icicle to let cool air in as you enter the
desert.

The enemies out in the desert are different from those you have faced before,
but overall, they are pretty weak. From the cave exit, head south between the
mountains into the large desert area. Head east about 10-15 steps before
heading south through the desert and you should spot a small town along the way
with some creature crawling around out side it. Enter it.

Items: Fife

Upon entering the small town of tents, enter the tent to your right, with the
different opening. It is a resting place so heal up there. Now enter the
northernmost, brownish-colored tent and talk to the Mayor standing in the
center of the room. He will tell you that the giant Sand Worm appears with
every new moon. He then tells you that he will give you the Fife, which can be
used to make a bridge over the quicksand of Krypt, if you destroy it. Agree and
he will mention that the Sand Worm eats goats. The screen goes black for a
short second and it is now nighttime. Exit the tent and head over to the right
to the large square area there where the goat once was. Walk up to the small,
rumbling circle of dust in the center and you will enter into battle.

         o--------------o---------------------------o--------------o
         |   This battle is EASY, so easy that I almost considered |
         |   categorizing it as a mini-boss battle. The SandWorm   |
         |   only has one attack that does about 17 damage to Ryu  |
         |   and Nina, and about double to Bo. His attacks affect  |
         |   Ryu even less in his dragon form. There is nothing    |
         |   special to this beast. His attacks are weak that you  |
         |   shouldn't have to heal at all.                        |

         |   runs out of AP. Have Ryu attack as a dragon each      |
         |   round while Nina fortifies and attacks as well.       |
         |   Within a few rounds, the SandWorm should fall.        |

Upon defeat, the SandWorm will sink into the ground and Ryu will raise his
sword in triumph. Back in the Mayor's tent, he will thank you and allow you to
take the Fife as a gift of his gratitude. Head up to the chest and take the
Fife, then exit the tent. Before leaving, heal at the resting tent and save at
the Dragon Shrine there. Now exit the town back into the desert.

From outside the little town of Arad, head south a short ways and you should
spot a large tomb structure. Step on the tile just south of it and press A to
make a bridge appear, apparently because of the Fife that you recently
obtained. Now head straight into the tomb.

Enemies: E.Chest, Fly, G.Slime, Mage, Midget, Scorp, WarHog
Items: Herb(x3), Life(x2), DreamRG, Dagger, IronSH, Cure, IcyHT, Antdt,
       SkullHT(x2), HuntCL

The enemies in here aren't anything too special. The new E.Chests have high
DEFENSE but they lack in ATTACK power. They also give generous rewards of over
1000 EP a piece. Anyways, in this area, follow the linear path all the way
around the room to the other side of the statues to your left. Now head through
the doorway and follow this hallway north and around to a large staircase,
which you should take down to the next floor. Head down the steps to the south
and you will find yourself in a very open room.

There are some chests in this area on raised platforms, but many traps block
paths to get to them. To get the one to the southwest, head west past it and
then south when you see a path. At the intersection you come to head right then
up the stairs and grab the Herb in the chest. This is optional, however, as the
chest triggers a Fire which does 50 damage to Ryu. It's kind of an even trade.
From here head back down the steps then go all the way to the left. Head north
up some stairs here to another chest with a Life. This chest poisons you so be
sure to heal him with Nina or an Antdt. Now head back down the steps and west
to the wall. Now proceed north past another set of platforms until you reach
one with another chest on it. Head up there and grab the DreamRG at the expense
of 50 points of damage to Ryu from Fire. I have no idea what this ring does so
I don't know who to equip it on.

Now go down the stairs and head all the way east to the wall of the raised area
where you first entered the room. Head south from here to another wall, then go
east again. Once you reach a second platform to the north, head south and then
up the first platform on the right. Grab the Dagger from the chest here at the
cost of losing AP. Now head down and right to an intersection. Head north from
here past one set of platforms to a second and enter the left one, taking the
IronSH in the chest. Use Nina to heal Ryu of his curse from the chest and head
down from the platform and just left to an intersection. Head north to the
wall, then east past one intersection, and south at a second. Head up the
platform to the right here and grab the Herb in the chest, healing your poison
afterwards. Now proceed down the stairs and west to a wall. Head south past a
couple platforms to the left and then head east and up a rather large platform.
Make your way down the large staircase here.

In this next area, head east and down another set of large stairs. On this
floor, head down and around the platform here and you will come to two more
raised platforms. Head up the right one and open the chest for a HeadGear and
equip it to Ryu. Due to a trap that triggers a Boom, Ryu will be reduced to 0
HP, so bring him back to life and heal him up. Head back down the stairs and
proceed north through the platforms (the left one has nothing that you can
access right now) until you see a floating monster ahead of you. Heal up before
you approach it then walk up to it and its eyes from all around the room will
converge on it. He will tell you that another intruder slipped past him but he
will not let you.

                         |   Boss Battle: EYESPY   |
         o---------------o-------------------------o---------------o
         |   Overall, this battle is pretty easy. As in the battle |
         |   versus the SandWorm, you should have to heal very     |
         |   minimally, or not at all. While EyeSpy has eyes still |
         |   surrounding him, he will attack with a weak eye       |
         |   strike that does only about 10-15 damage. As it loses |
         |   HP, however, its eyes get destroyed. Once it has no   |
         |   eyes left, it will strike blindly with a powerful     |
         |   thunder attack that does around 25-30 damage to each  |
         |   party member. This only happens when EyeSpy's HP is   |
         |   very low so you shouldn't have too much trouble with  |
         |   it.                                                   |

         |   Your offensive strategy should be the same as your    |
         |   recent boss battles. In round one, have Ryu transform |
         |   into the ThrDr and continue to attack with his        |
         |   powerful thunder attacks each round. Nina should take |
         |   the first few rounds to cast spells such as Fort and  |
         |   Atk-Up on Ryu and Bo. Bo should cast Fry and other    |
         |   offensive spells until his AP runs out and then       |
         |   continue with normal attacks. You should have little  |
         |   trouble with this fiend.                              |

After its defeat, EyeSpy says that you're only human and that you should not
possess such power and then disappears. Now head down the large stairs up ahead
to a final room with five red chests and a single blue chest arranged in this
order:

                   [R] = red chest     [B] = blue chest

                                  [R][R]
                               [R][B]   [R]
                                     [R]

The order is not really that important, but I just thought it was odd for some
reason. Well grab the Cure, IcyHT, Antdt, and two SkullHT. Equip the IcyHT on
Bo and a SkullHT on Nina, and then try and open the sole blue chest.

       !   Suddenly, two gargoyle mouths on the wall ahead of you     !
       !   will open up and water will pour firth from them. Nina     !
       !   panic, saying that she doesn't know how to swim. After a   !

       !   that your are on. Bo suggests that you search the area to  !
       !   find a way out. As you walk around the area, the blue      !
       !   will suddenly move aside, revealing a small staircase. You !
       !   hear Karn's voice saying that the trap is too simple and   !
       !   that it would only catch a fool.                           !

       !   Nina says that she almost drowned looking for him and he   !
       !   asks what's going on. Bo mentions that someone is trapped  !
       !   in a safe in Auria and asks if he can open it. Karn        !
       !   replies that he can open anything for you if you bring him !
       !   the Book from the tomb. Nina and Bo then suggest that Karn !
       !   comes with them, and after some persuading, he agrees and  !
       !   heads down the stairs ahead of you.                        !

Proceed down the stairs and talk to Karn here. He will tell you that he will
take care of any locked doors in the area and then joins your party. Before you
continue, hook him up with a Dagger, SkullHT, and IronSH and I would switch him
from the back row to the front row to exploit his attacks, though fairly weak.
Now head over to the left, with Karn in the front of your party, and open the
two locked doors here. Follow the winding path south and back north again down
a long hallway to a fork. Head west first and take the Life and Herb items from
the chests here, having Karn disarm the traps on them first. There is nothing
more over here so head back east until you come to a locked door. Open it and
head down the staircase here.

Here, follow the linear path west and south to another staircase, which you
should take up a floor. In this open area, you should spot a hallway heading
south. Follow this winding path to a trapped chest. Use Karn to disarm it, then
take the HuntCL from it, equipping it to Karn to increase his DEFENSE as well
as ACTIVE attributes. Now head back to the main area and proceed north up a
platform and take the large stairs there. On this next platform, head right to
another set of large stairs to get to the final area of the Krypt. In this open
room, head south to a casket and have Karn disarm the trap. Nothing will be in
it so disarm and open the other seven caskets in the room found in this
pattern:

  [  ]                    [  ]                    [  ]

In the eighth and final casket you open, there will be something written. You
discover that the casket is the Book. It says that since you have figured out
the trap, you already have great skills. Karn gains confidence from this and he
proceeds to jump up and down and proclaim that he is the greatest. Nina tells
him to stuff it as your party must get back to Auria now. Now make your way all
the way out of the Krypt to the desert with your new party member. The way out
shouldn't be too hard to find.

Now, since you have Karn in your party, you can complete the first side-quest,
which I entitled "Unlocking Doors," because it requires Karn to unlock some
doors that you previously could not open. When and whether you choose to do it
is up to you. But either way, have Nina use Warp to quickly get your party back
to Bleak.

Save at the Dragon Statue here before you exit the Shrine, and once you do, you
may want to head to the Inn just to the west. Now exit the city.

first visited Bleak? Well, head back around the lake and enter the tower as
you'll need to acquire some crucial items here before moving on.

Enemies: Bulla, Chopper, Flea, Fungus, Shadow, Slime
Items: 2000GP(x2), B.Stn, Life, Life2, Turban, DkKey, Mirror

Wow, the enemies in this first room are ridiculous. They are they same, shitty
creatures that you fought when you first explored the World Map. Don't worry,
though, they get harder. But anyways, go straight ahead, with Karn at the front
of your party, and unlock the door up ahead. Now head over to the right and
grab the 2000GP in the chest before taking the stairs to the left. In this
room, head south and then to the right and talk to the old man in white here.
He will tell you that if you're the legendary hero, he will give you his
treasure and to climb the tower and meet the ghosts to prove your worth. He
then moves back, unblocking your path, but blocking off a chest (obviously his
treasure). Simply head left and up to a staircase and take it up a floor.

In this room, you will notice a staircase on either side of you. Head up the
left one and grab the B.Stn and Life in this enclosed area. Now head back
downstairs and take the right staircase. Up here, head south down a hallway to
a split in the path. There's nothing over to the left, so head up the stairs to
the right. Now head straight up another staircase. In this area, take the Life2
in the chest and continue left down another staircase. Now in this enclosed
room, take the Herb, Cure, and HornHT in the three chests here. The HornHT is
quite a strong Helm and I would give it to Karn. Now head back up the stairs
and down the ones to the right in the next room. Back in this area, head south
past the stairs and then follow the path east and north to another staircase,
which you should take.

Head left from the staircase to the wall then south to the southern wall. Pass
up the stairs here and continue on east to another set of stairs. Take these
upstairs and, in the next room, head west and up some more stairs. Up here,
grab the Turban and 2000GP from the chests and then make your way back down two
floors. Head west back over to the stairs you passed earlier and take these
now. Now make your way to the stairs east of you and head up these to get to
the area next to the pillar with the glowing golden orb atop it. Heal your team
and then examine the pillar and a red spirit will appear. The entity will
announce that only Dragons used to enter there, but since the LtKey was stolen,
things have changed. It then challenges you to fight.

         o----------------o------------------------o---------------o
         |   Cloud is a fairly strong boss that can do some damage |
         |   to your party through his elemental attacks. He       |
         |   normally attacks with a single-hitting elemental      |
         |   that hits for 40 damage, but occasionally, he will    |
         |   use his Devistate attack that does 45 damage to each  |
         |   party member. This is some pretty hefty damage, but   |
         |   hopefully you can defend against them and heal up     |
         |   afterwards.                                           |

         |   can also have him use any Stn items you have, but     |
         |   it's your preference. As always, have Ryu use ThrDr   |
         |   and maintain the onslaught of powerful thunder        |
         |   strikes while Bo uses Fry and other spells until his  |
         |   AP runs out. Nina should use Atk-Up and then either   |
         |   attack or heal whenever necessary. With this strategy |
         |   you should never get into any trouble.                |

After defeating Cloud, he will congratulate you and tell you to take a Key and
to find the LtKey to complete the pair. Once the spirit vanishes, search the
pillar to receive the DkKey. The tower will now become much brighter. Now head
down the stairs behind you and then down the stairs over to the left on the
lower floor. In this area, head north and then east down some more stairs. Now
head south and then back around north to another staircase heading down, and
then do the same down some more stairs in the next room. Here, head down the
stairs just to the left and you will be back in the room with the old man in
white who promised you treasure. Head southeast and talk to him again. He will
congratulate you, calling you a true hero, then he will move aside, allowing
you to take the Mirror in the chest. Now proceed east and north to another set
of stairs heading down. Take them, and in this first room, head south through
the doorway and out of the tower.

Instead of just using Nina's Warp spell to quickly get back to Auria head
southwest from the L & D Tower and enter the cave here.

Enemies: Bully, Fly, Midget

In here, head all the way north, past a path left, to the northern wall.
Proceed west from here and open the locked door you come across with Karn. Take
the G.Bar from the chest and then continue on the path west. Follow it around
to the south and hit the ground switch there to lower the gate. Now head all
the way south out of the cave. From the exit, head east to Auria.

Go ahead and save at the Dragon Shrine here and you probably will also want to
stop at the Inn just to the northeast and take a rest to heal up. Be wary of
the guard, however, as he still remembers you and will throw you in jail if you
cross him. Now head all the way to the northern manor where Ross lives. Head
north through the columns then west and south to some stairs leading down. Take
these and then open the two locked doors of the safe in this room. Now talk to
the girl here and she will tell you that if her mother was alive, she would've
told Ross to do the right thing. Now go back upstairs and talk to Ross, who has
stopped running around in circles on his carpet and is at the dining table at
the northeast corner of the room.

       !   Ross will say that if he gives up the Key, the Dark        !
       !   Dragons will harm his daughter. After a pause the          !
       !   flickering image of a woman appears at the table as Karn   !
       !   raises the Mirror. This causes the ghost of Ross' wife,    !
       !   Alena, to appear. Ross consults her as to what to do.      !
       !   She asks him if he really thinks giving up the Key will    !
       !   help their daughter. Ross realizes that giving them the    !
       !   Key, things will only get worse. Alena approves of his     !
       !   decision, and then departs.                                !

After the apparition leaves, talk to Ross again and he will tell you that he's
come to his senses at last, and that he wants you to tell his daughter that he
was wrong. So head back down to the basement and talk to his daughter again.
She will recognize that her father has changed his mind and that the Dark
Dragons are coming for the key. Agree to help them fight off the Dragons and
she will tell you that the LtKey is at the top of this tower. Open the eight
chests here for five Herbs, a Dart, B.Stn, and MetalSH. Equip the Dart to Karn
then proceed up the stairs here. Head up a couple more sets of stairs until you
are in a purple-floored room. Follow the path around to a staircase and take
these up a floor. Grab the F.Stn in the chest here then proceed up the stairs
to the left. Examine the pillar with the glowing orb and you will receive the
LtKey, completing the pair. Now return to the main area of the house and exit
it.

Now head south all the way out of the manor area and then head west over to the
dock. Talk to the captain here and he will tell you that he'd like to sail with
you, but the Dragons are blocking the way. So head west over to where the boat
is and heal up to prepare for a battle. Approach the two soldiers here and they
will notice that you have the LtKey and he offers to take it off your hands.

         |   This battle is so easy that it really shouldn't be    |
         |   classified as a mini-boss battle, but the reward you  |
         |   get from it says otherwise. These two attack with     |
         |   regular attacks that do only about 10-15 damage, and  |
         |   the knight has a pretty weak thunder attack that can  |
         |   do 25-30 damage. It's nothing big at all.             |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Have Ryu become the ThrDr and while everyone else     |
         |   focuses all their attacks on the Knight. Have Bo use  |
         |   Fry constantly while Nina uses Atk-Up on Karn, then   |
         |   attacks as well. Once the Knight falls, simply pick   |
         |   off the archer with ease.                             |

That's a fairly nice reward for such an easy battle. Once they are defeated,
the Knight will proclaim that Ross has betrayed them and that you will soon
know the wrath of the Dark Dragons. The Archer then waves out to sea and the
ship suddenly starts blowing up and sinking. The screen then flashes white and
the ship is totally ruined. The Knight and Archer then vanish. Well that
sucks... The Captain then comes over and marvels at the last blast that
destroyed the ship. Some fish character, who you later find out is Gobi, then
comes up and mentions moving a roc blocking the North Cave to surprise them. He
then offers GnPwdr to blast the rock in exchange for a G.Bar. Talk to him again
and agree to the trade, using the G.Bar you recently acquired from the L & D
Cave. Now head back east and then exit the gold city to the south after resting
at the Inn and saving at the Dragon Shrine.

As soon as you take a step onto the ship, a soldier will approach, leaving
because his shift is over. He will spot you and try to stop you. Defeat the
Archer then head down the stairs ahead. As you start to walk south, two more
soldiers will approach you and try and stop you. Defeat this Archer and
SpearMan and then continue south and around into a bedroom and head up the
stairs here. The Knight here will see you and tell you that you cannot get this
far from luck alone. He'll then use that Star Fox 64 line that Star Wolf taunts
you with: "You're good...but I'm better," then he morphs into a squid and
battles you.

         |   each party member for anywhere from 30-60 damage.     |
         |   This attack can be harsh, but you should be able to   |

         |   allies' attributes and heal whenever necessary. Keep  |
         |   up the attacks with Karn as well as the thunder       |
         |   strikes with Bo and Ryu and you should finish it off. |

The Captain turned Squid admits defeat but assures you that his brother will
seek revenge. He then disappears and you regain control of your party. Search
the chest of drawers here for a V.Ptn, then head down the stairs to the right.
Grab the two Acorns and Herbs from the chests here then make your way out of
the ship. Head back east along the stone path and then north in the Secret Base
area back into the Cape Cave. Follow the path past where the rocks were and
head south out of the cave. Out on the World Map, head south around the large
land mass and back into Auria.

       !   your ship demanding the key. Gobi suggests that you        !
       !   detonate the GnPwdr on the ship, but Nina refuses. Just    !

Defeat the two Archers and SpearMan that battle you. After the battle, Gobi,
being the coward that he is, wants to escape. You follow him down the ship, but
the General and some more soldiers pursue you. Defeat three more Archers and
Gobi continues to flee down to the GnPwdr after the battle. Again, the General
follows you down and traps you. He sends two more Archers against you and,
after you defeat them, the General will transmute and do battle with you
himself.

         |   Wow, this battle is simple, maybe even easier than    |
         |   battle against his brother, Squid. Octo has a melee   |
         |   attack as well as a projectile attack, but it doesn't |
         |   hit each party member like Squid's projectile attack. |
         |   Both his attacks do anywhere from 20-50 damage        |
         |   depending on who they hit. They can hit hard, but     |
         |   they only strike one ally, making it easy for you to  |
         |   counter with a Cura spell.                            |

         |   healing from the previous battles. If you want a      |
         |   surer victory, use the same tactics as against Squid. |
         |   Have Ryu use his ThrDr attacks, Bo use Fry (of what   |
         |   AP he has left), and Nina use her Shield spell, if    |
         |   she has it by now, and heal when necessary. Karn      |
         |   do what he can and attack. If your party is suffering |
         |   from the previous non-stop battles, use an M.Drop to  |
         |   heal everyone during the first round. This battle is  |
         |   too easy - you should breeze right through it.        |

The town of Prima is not far away. You can take the western path here out to
the city, but there are no guarantees you will make it without dying. The
enemies here are strong and you will likely get killed in a battle or two
before making it to the town. Don't worry if this happens, you will be
transported to Prima's Dragon Shrine at the expense of only about 25% of your
cash. Either way you get there is up to you.

Take some time to heal at the Inn just north here (it is cheaper than the one
to the left), if you need to, and then head over to the right into the Dragon
Shrine to save your game (unless you started there already). Now visit the
Weapons and Items Shops here - there are several as this is a merchant town.
There are four Weapons and Items Shops visible outside, and if you enter the
large building in the center with the yellow roof, you will find two more
Weapon Shops and another Item Shop. Head to the Weapon Shop to the left as you
enter the city and grab an IcySH and a HornHT. Now head to the upper-leftmost
Weapon Shop, just north of the yellow-roofed building. Buy a Javelin and a
SpineCL here and equip these items to Gobi. Now enter the tall building to the
north with a picture of a fish on it. Talk to the guy over to the right and he
will tell you that he doesn't have any Gills, but Gant does. Well, there is
nothing else to do here, so leave the town.

Gant is back on land, so you'll need to find a beach back up to land. Now, even
with your new equipment, the enemies will still be quite tough, so make haste
south to a wall. Then head east from here until you spot the ramp of the beach,
and head south up here to get back to the World Map.

Items: HrGlas, L.Ptn, Goods, A.Ptn

Save first at the Dragon Shrine just northeast of you when you enter. Now rest
at the Inn to the left if you need to before trading in your Javelin for a
HeroSP at the Weapon Shop just north of the Dragon Shrine. Now enter the lower
left house in the city, to the left of the Inn with a flat roof, and take the
HrGlas from the chest of drawers here. It is a nice little item that switches
night and day quickly. Now head up a set of stairs north and enter the flat-
roofed house to the right. Take the L.Ptn from the chest of drawers in this
room. Now head up another set of stairs and enter the building up here.

In this large house, talk to the guy over to the right blocking the entrance to
a room. He will ask if you are from Prima and then mention that the Dark
Dragons attack and took their young men. He will then offer for you to take
some goods to the Prima Guild Owner. Accept and then grab the Goods from the
chest behind him. Now head up the stairs here and talk to the woman in pink.
She will mention that the young men are being forced to build a secret weapon
in a fortress on the western side of the mountain. Now examine the chest of
drawers in this room for an A.Ptn, then exit the house and the city.

Follow the linear path through the trees back south and then around the
mountains north and east. Enter the beach to the north to get back underwater
and then make your way north and east back into Prima.

Back in Prima, head all the way north to the tall building with the fish face
on the front after a stop at the Inn to rest and Dragon Shrine to save. Talk to
the fish man over to the right once again and he will thank you for the Goods
by giving you some Gills.

       !   Apparently the survivor, called Ox, has important          !
       !   information to pass on. Gobi will announce that he knows a !
       !   warrior who can get rid of the ghost, but it will cost     !
       !   5000GP (Gobi, always looking for a way to earn some cash). !
       !   Accept and the Guild Owner will tell you to get him        !

Once you regain control of Gobi, head downstairs and out of the Inn, then

beach up to land.

Head north into the beach area where Ryu and his party are. Talk to Ryu and he
will apologize for taking so long. The whole party will join up with you. Now
with five party members, you can choose who is in the fighting team but
changing whoever is in the left row. I kept Gobi in there for now but you can
choose to put Bo back in if you so choose. Now, head south back into the water,
placing on the Gills to allow the rest of the party to breathe down there as
well. Head west out to Prima down here, taking some time to level Gobi up
through some battles.

Once you enter, rest at one of the Inns and save at the Dragon Shrine. Check
out the multiple Weapon Shops and upgrade all of your party's equipment. Get a
PowerSD for Ryu, an IcySH for Karn and Bo, and a HornHT for Bo and Karn at the
leftmost Weapon Shop. From one of the Weapon Shops inside the yellow-roofed
building, procure a EvilRP for Nina. Now exit there and head all the way to the
right and enter the Weapon Shop here. Grab a PoisonBW for Bo, a RangerVT for Bo
and Ryu, and some PlateAR for Karn. Now head just northwest from there to
another Weapon Shop and buy a Tri-DR for Karn. Now exit and head directly west
to the final Weapon Shop. In here, obtain a LightSH and SuedeRB for Nina.

Now you should be fully upgraded, so sell anything and everything that you
don't need so you can get some cash back, and then head to the Inn just to the
left of the entrance to the town. Head upstairs and talk to the ghost at the
front of the bed. The ghost will tell you to give up as you are powerless
against him. We'll see about that.

Now your party consists of Ox, Gobi, Ryu, and Nina. I don't like how slow your
party is so I switched out Gobi for Karn. The choice is up to you what members
you want in your party. But anyways, heal at the Inn here and then exit out
into the town. With your new member, you may want to upgrade his equipment with
what money you have. Grab an IronHR and a HornHT right now from the Weapon Shop
to the right of where you came out and equip them to Ox. Now save at the Dragon
Shrine and exit the city.

Well Ox, Gobi, and even Karn should still be at fairly low levels at this time
so take some time to do battle with the underwater creatures and maybe raise a
level or so before moving on. Head back into Prima to rest at the Inn and save
at the Dragon Shrine. Now head northwest from Prima to another beach up to
land.

Enemies: Chimera, M.Scorp, R.Slime

Out here, the enemy set has changed and some of the enemies are quite strong.
The R.Slime here are pretty pathetic, compared to the G.Slime who reward you
will a great amount of experience after beating them. You can take some time to
level up here as well, but it's up to you. Once you're ready, take the southern
path from the beach through a large field of dead trees. Continue along the
path through the mountains until you come to a tomb that looks like the Krypt
and enter it.

Enemies: Archer, LancerX, Sorcerer, SpearMan
Items: GiantHR, EchoHT, Herb(x2), Life, MetalSH

Most of the enemies here are Dark Dragon henchmen who usually come in groups.
They can give you a hard time but it's nothing you haven't faced before. Just
remember to heal up after difficult battles to stay in good shape. Head down
the stairs straight ahead of you and in this next room, head south to some
rocks blocking your path. Switch Ox to the front of the party and press A to
destroy one of the rocks. Now head left past some stairs and have Ox break down
the weak wall here. Grab the GiantHR and EchoHT in the chests here and equip
the two-handed hammer to Ox and the helm to Nina. Now make your way up the
stairs just to the south.

In this room, you can either break the wall to the north then go west, or go
around to the west first. Either way, fight the LancerX who approaches you over
here and grab the Herb in the chest. Now head north and west through a hallway
to another chest with an Herb. Defeat the LancerX guarding this post and then
head east until you come to two breakable walls to the north. Bust open the
west one with Ox and follow this hallway to a chest containing a Life. Now head
back to where you broke the wall and head southeast down through a doorway.
Follow the path east to a chest with a MetalSH and then proceed northwest,
defeating the LancerX who approaches you here.

Now head directly north to a weak wall, which you should break down with Ox.
Now take the southern path here, to the right, and continue down it until you
reach a breakable wall to the north. Break it down and head north through it to
a staircase. But before you go down the stairs, heal your party up for a boss
battle. Now head downstairs and you will be confronted by a Knight. He will say
that Ox has got guts for coming back, but it's not enough. You will then enter
battle with him as he transforms into a Toad.

         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Yet another frog boss to do battle with, this one can |
         |   be tough and grueling. It has two main attacks just   |
         |   like the first Frog you battled: a tongue strike and  |
         |   a projectile attack, each damaging a single ally. The |
         |   tongue lash can hurt, doing about 60 damage while the |
         |   projectile does around 40 and even up to 70 or 80     |
         |   against your weaker party members. That's pretty much |
         |   all there is to Toad. He is strong, but Nina can      |
         |   counter each round with her healing spells.           |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   I suggest using a party of Ryu, Nina, Ox, and Gobi    |
         |   against Toad, but it is really up to you. You can     |
         |   switch Karn or Bo in there for Ox or Gobi if you      |
         |   wish, but always have Nina for her healing and        |
         |   fortifying spells as well as Ryu for his powerful     |
         |   attacks. As always, have Ryu use his ThrDr attacks    |
         |   while Nina uses Fort and Atk-Up on your other allies, |
         |   healing whoever is below 60 HP. Keep up the attacks   |
         |   with your remaining party members and eventually,     |
         |   Toad will fall.                                       |

       !   replies that he could not have rescued them without the    !

       !   north and that Ox's wife is among the captives. Another of !
       !   the Friends tells Ryu that security at Nabal is tight but  !
       !   that an old man near Gant, who used to be in the Dragon    !

Well, now that you have Ox with his ability to break things, you can do another
side-quest, which I appropriately labeled "Break Stuff." If and whenever you
choose to do this is your choice, but any time now is opportune. Once you are
all ready to continue the main adventure, warp your party to Arad to pick up
something ahead of time. Save at the Dragon Statue in the Inn here and then
take some time to rest up. Now exit the tent and continue out of the town to
the southwest. Now head just southwest to where the Krypt is and step on tile
in front of the entrance. Press A to use the Fife, making a bridge appear then
head straight into the Krypt.

Revisiting this dungeon, head through the doorway to the northeast and then
make your way down the large stairs here. In this large room, head south down
form the platform and head southeast to another large platform and make your
way down the large stairs on it. Head east down another stairway and head south
down from the platform. Make your way around to the north until you come to two
platforms. This time, head up the left one and use Ox to break the rock that
was holding the B.Rang. Now take it and make your way back up the staircases
and out of the Krypt. Once outside, have Nina Warp your party to Gant.

                                 =-=-=-=-=-=-

Save at the Dragon Statue then exit the Shrine and make your way north to the
Weapon Shop. Gant has some pretty nice items to take some time to upgrade Ox's
equipment. For a hefty price, grab a SpineHR for him, which is amazingly
powerful and only one-handed, allowing him to hold a shield as well. Also,
purchase some MetalAR and equip these items as well as the MetalSH you found in
the Hidden Fort to Ox. Now sell back any unused items exit, making your way
north, up three flights of stairs to the large building up here.

Talk to the man here and he will notice your B.Rang and offer to fix it for you
while you rest. After a short pause, the man will have fixed it and you take it
back from him. Now, equip it to Ryu and then head northeast into the room where
you got the goods from the chest. Notice a hole in the wall behind some drawers
to the right? Well push it to the let or right and enter the hole. Now walk
straight ahead and use Ox to break one of the rocks here to get to the man
behind them. Switch Karn to the front of your party and talk to the man. The
man will see that you are Karn and teach you the Shin spell as Karn is a member
of his family line. This spell fuses Karn, Bo, and Gobi together so use it
right away to add a powerful member to your group. Now exit the house and leave
the city.

Out here, you must find the person that one of the prisoners mentioned who has
advice for you. Head south from Gant through the dead trees and follow the path
through the mountains around to the north. Continue on east past a beach and
northeast up to a peninsula with some sand and palm trees. Head to the eastern
end of this area and enter the little hut here.

Proceed straight ahead and talk to the old man standing with a goat outside a
tent. He will notice your B.Rang and the fact that it is authentic and perfect.
The man will then spin around multiple times and then tell you that the
GrimFowl is a tame bird until you mess with its eggs, at which it becomes
berserk. He then tells you that you could use this as a weapon. After he is
done giving advice, exit the area.

Quickly make your way through here by going down the stairs here and taking the
stairs to the southwest in the next room. Now head directly north through a
couple broken walls until you come to the two weak walls. Break down the right
one with Ox, if it has not been done already, and continue north a short way to
a fork in the path. Take the right path up through a broken wall and back
around to the south until you come to another broken wall. Make your way north
through this one all the way up to a staircase. Head down this and then make
your way all the way east and north to another staircase. Take this one up and
head north out of the Fort.

the center of the area. Heal your party, and then try and take the egg. A bird
will get angry and attack you.

                        |   Boss Battle: GRIMFOWL   |
         o--------------o---------------------------o--------------o
         |   The GrimFowl is quite an easy boss. Its two attacks   |
         |   aren't anything special. It can spit something at you |
         |   doing around 15-30 damage or use a fire elemental     |
         |   attack spell which hits for anywhere from 50-80       |
         |   damage. Once the GrimFowl has no more visible HP      |
         |   remaining and starts to get mad, it will use the fire |
         |   attack spell every round. It is powerful, but it only |
         |   damages one ally.                                     |

         |   You strategy is simple: attack, attack some more, and |
         |   keep on attacking. The GrimFowl has horrible defense  |
         |   so you don't even need to use ThrDr for Ryu to hit    |
         |   for near or over 100 damage. Karn and Ox usually hit  |
         |   for over 150 damage! With everyone attacking, the     |
         |   GrimFowl shouldn't last too long. You probably won't  |
         |   even need to heal with Nina, but do so just in case.  |

After taming the GrimFowl, take the Egg, but this time, you won't be attacked.
Instead, they will follow you around. Play around with them for a little if you
wish, then slowly head north out of the woods, making sure that at least one
follows you out.

Now head north to the castle with the GrimFowl following close behind. As you
try to enter the castle, Ryu throws the egg into first.

As you first enter, you will notice that some GrimFowl are tying up the guards
here. Make your way north through them and enter the castle itself.

NABAL CASTLE
Enemies: M.Scorp, SpearMan
Items: Life2, SkullRG

Another GrimFowl is chasing around the guard here so make your way past them
and head right through an opening in the wall. Now follow the path up and east
and then back south to a staircase. But before you head down it, head south and
grab the Life2 and SkullRG from the jars here. If there is a guard and a
GrimFowl blocking the way, simply head down the stairs and back up and they
should be gone. Equip the SkullRG to whoever needs a boost to defense and
continue on down the stairs.

Follow the linear route down here south, west, and around north to a breakable
wall. Knock it down with Ox, healing your team before you do, and you will
encounter a General and three of his Helpers. The General will tell you that
you have done well to get here, but he does not have time to deal with you. The
Helpers will then attack you, transforming as they do.

                       |   Mini-Boss Battle: SLIMEX   |
         o-------------o------------------------------o------------o
         |   This battle has two parts to it, both of which are    |
         |   quite easy. At first, you must fight three SlimeX     |
         |   monsters all at once. They each attack one ally with  |
         |   a melee strike doing about 20 damage, which is        |
         |   nothing. Once each of them are defeated, their        |
         |   puddles of slime will come together to form a bigger  |
         |   SlimeX. This new monster is just as simple. It's only |
         |   attack is flinging slime at one party member, doing   |
         |   only about 40-50 damage. This is also quite weak so   |
         |   you probably won't even have to heal during this      |
         |   battle.                                               |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Your offensive strategy for your team of Ryu, Nina,   |
         |   Ox, and Karn (fused as Shin) should be to simply      |
         |   attack, concentrating on the two outside SlimeX, as   |
         |   they inflict slightly more damage, being in the upper |
         |   row. Ryu is deadly with his B.Rang, as he attacks     |
         |   each SlimeX. You can have Nina use Atk-Up if you      |
         |   wish, but it is not needed. When they mutate to form  |
         |   the larger SlimeX, keep up the attacks, using Nina to |
         |   heal if ever necessary. It should fall soon as well.  |

First off, use put Karn back in your party and use his Shin spell to fuse with
Bo and Gobi again as your party has been changed since. Now head up the stairs
to the left in the back of the room. Talk to the man in the bed here and he
will jump out of bed when he hears you talk of a sorceress. Speak with him
again and he will tell you that the sorceress can be found in Wisdon but she
won't like to be woken. He then says that you can only enter the town if you
have the Statue and to look under the bed for one. So step into the bed that he
was in, look down, and press A to receive the Statue. Now head back down the
stairs and exit the house. Rest at the Inn and save at the Dragon Shrine here,
then leave the town.

Head either south or east from the underwater city and up a beach to land. Once
on land, use Nina's Warp spell to transport your party to the desert town of
Arad. Now exit the tent and continue southwest out of the camp. Back outside,
walk around in the vicinity north of Arad and you should notice a small, bug-
like thing moving about the desert. Enter it.

There is nothing much to do in this empty town as many of the doors to the
houses are blocked. You can save at the Dragon Shrine to the left if you wish
and talk to the spirits here to learn about the sorceress. Once you are done,
head down the stairs here to the dungeon of Wisdon.

WISDON DUNGEON
Enemies: Chopper, M.Scorp, R.Slime
Items: Life2, Life(x2), Herb(x4), ProSH(x2), OldSP, SilverBR, RageHR, ChainML

The enemies in this area are generally weak and shouldn't give you much trouble
at all. You have seen them all before so you know how to handle them. Once you
enter the dungeon, head north until you come to a small area with pillars and
three other paths branching off from it. Take the eastern path first off and
follow it right and up to a breakable wall. Switch Ox to the front of the party
and break down two walls in front of you. Now grab the Life2 in the chest to
the right of you, then head back and bust down another wall to the north. Head
left and down to a chest with a Life, then make you way all the way back to
where the path splits. Continue on the path leading west and follow it up to
another set of three breakable walls. Do the same routine as at the other side
of the room, grabbing the Herb and ProSH in the chests here after breaking the
weak walls.

Equip the latter to Ox and then make your way back to the fork area. Finally,
take the northern path and head down the stairs up here. In this next area,
make your way north a long way, under a meaningless archway up to a platform
with a wide set of stairs on it. To gain access to the chest to the right, head
to the left and up to some rocks. Have Ox break them then continue east and
south to the chest containing an OldSP. Now head back around the room and up
the set of stairs. In this large, open area, head south down from the platform
all the way to the southern wall. Now head west until you come to a breakable
wall just to the north. Use Ox to break it down and take the Life and SilverBR
from the chests here.

Now head out of this enclosed room and make your way across the room to the
northeast. Make your way in between two more enclosed rooms and break the wall
to the north. Grab the Herb and RageHR from the chests here. Now head south out
of the room and break the wall to the south here to enter another small area.
Head down the stairs to the right here and follow this linear hallway west,
north, and west again to another staircase. Take it back up a level to a room
with four chests containing ChainML, two Herbs, and another ProSH. Give this
shield to Karn[Shin] and continue back down the stairs, southeast through the
hallway, and up the other set of stairs. Now head northwest from the enclosed
room to a raised platform with some pillars and a large set of stairs on it,
which you should take up and out of the dungeon.

_.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-

Now head north into the large castle just ahead of you. In this dark place,
head directly ahead to a fountain, which you should drink from to recover your
HP and AP. Now make your way up the stairs to the right to a floor with three
ghostlike figures to the left. Approach the apparitions and you will be shocked
back. The three figures will approach you and one of them will acknowledge that
you are the destined hero while another asks if you come to disturb the
Sorceress's sleep. The third then tells you that you must prove your worth to
be in the presence of the sorceress. One then attacks you.

         |   at Agua Tower very early on in your gaming adventure. |
         |   This first of three ghosts is a breeze. It either     |
         |   attacks will a body slam thing that does only around  |
         |   ten damage. He can also attack with a projectile ball |
         |   that is a little stronger, doing about 15-20 damage   |
         |   to each party member. Still, this multi-hitting       |
         |   attack is nothing to be scared about. Wisp is         |
         |   extremely weak in its defenses as well. I recommend   |
         |   just putting your party on AUTO, and the ghost should |
         |   be downed within a few rounds.                        |

with you without giving you any time to heal, though you shouldn't need it.

                        |   Mini-Boss Battle: CLOUD   |
         o--------------o-----------------------------o------------o
         |   This boss is the exact same thing as the Cloud you    |
         |   fought at the L & D Tower. It has the same fire and   |
         |   lightning elemental attacks that do around 40 damage  |
         |   to one party member and the same Devistate attack     |
         |   hits each ally for 45 damage. Your strategy should be |
         |   a bit different than the previous time you fought it  |
         |   as you should be much stronger this time around. You  |
         |   should just attack always as you did against Wisp.    |
         |   Cloud is somewhat stronger so he won't go down as     |
         |   easy. He can also take a toll on your health so have  |
         |   Nina heal if ever necessary. Just keep up the attacks |
         |   and it will fall relatively quickly.                  |

nice "Well Done!" and then takes its turn against you.

         |   This green-colored apparition is a bit more           |
         |   formidable than its washed-up counterparts. It        |
         |   attacks in elemental spells, and a higher level of    |
         |   them than you have encountered before. His T.Bolt and |
         |   Blizzard attacks hit all party members for 40 damage  |
         |   while his Burn Out only hits one ally. Myst also uses |
         |   his Recover spell when his HP gets low to replenish   |
         |   100 HP. This isn't big because you entire party can   |
         |   inflict more than 100 damage to it per round.         |

         |   her to heal if necessary, attack, or use her Shield   |
         |   spell on your party if you feel you need it. Ryu      |
         |   attack as his ThrDr transformation and Ox and         |
         |   Karn[Shin] should attack each round. Myst has about   |

Enemies: AmeblobX, CrawlerX, DogFish, Tentacle
Items: SharpBW, 3000GP, M.Drop, PowerDR, 2000GP, Herb

There are some new enemies that you will encounter here. The AmeblobX can be a
pain (remember the green Ameblob?) but they give some decent experience points.
You shouldn't have very much trouble in this underwater cave as long s you keep
your party healthy with Nina. Upon entering, head directly north to a fork in
the path. Follow the eastern path first to another fork, continuing east to a
chest with a SharpBW. Give it to Bo, though he should be fused at the time, and
then head up the northern path. Follow this linear path all the way up and
around to the left until you reach a split in the path where some underwater
plants are. Continue west here and grab the 3000GP in the chest, and then go
back and head down the southern path. You will come to some stairs, which you
should take up a floor.

In this room, head up the stairs to your right and examine the chest in the
room above for an M.Drop. Now head back down a level and follow the path to the
west. Continue on the path as it goes south and east past some stairs. When you
come to a fork, take the southern route to a chest with a PowerDR. If you have
the IcyDR equipped to Karn[Shin], then you don't need to give him the PowerDR.
Now return to where the path forked and head east all the way to a chest
containing 2000GP. After grabbing this money, take your party all the way back
west to the staircase you passed earlier and head up this. In this new area,
grab the Herb in the chest and then follow the path west and south to a ledge
with some lava below you. Head over to the left a little and you should notice
a small strip of cliff extending out to the south. Walk out onto this narrow

Your party will consist of Ryu, Bleu, Gobi, and Ox. This is a pretty crappy
setup so fuse Karn with Bo and Ox again to form Shin and exchange Ox for Nina.
Also, switch Bleu to the back line to enhance her defense. Now head up north
where a bunch of fish and Dark Dragons are. As you approach, one of the fish
will tell you to take care of the leader while he handles the rest. You walk up
to the General, who does battle with you for destroying his battalion, morphing
as he does.

         o---------------o--------------------------o--------------o
         |   Pincher can be a pretty tough boss as he has pretty   |
         |   high defense and it will take some time to take him   |
         |   down. He has two attacks: a melee strike that does    |
         |   around 20-30 damage to one party member, and a        |
         |   thunder strike. This attack is very harmful, doing 95 |
         |   damage to each party member! A few of these hits can  |
         |   take out your whole team, well except Karn[Shin] who  |
         |   has 500+ HP. Anyways, heal up with an M.Drop or with  |
         |   Nina's Cura spells each time Pincher uses T.Bolt.     |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   With a powerful new offensive spell-caster added to   |
         |   your party, your strategy should be slightly altered. |
         |   As always, use Ryu's strong ThrDr attacks each round  |
         |   while Karn[Shin] attacks normally and Nina heals or   |
         |   uses Shield on your allies. Blue should cast Fry each |
         |   round, as thunder seems to be Pincher's weakness.     |
         |   Though Pincher's defense is high, his is weak to      |
         |   magic, so continue with thunder element spells to     |
         |   down this crustacean quickly.                         |

Items: Sphere, MystSF

Make your way north to the Guild Owner's shop and once inside, head up and talk
to the Guild Owner. He will welcome Gobi back and give him the license as well
as the Sphere. He heads up to the wall and makes two blue chests drop down
while he tells you that a member of their clan can use the Sphere to turn into
a big fish. Grab the Sphere and MystSF from the chests, and then leave the
house. While you're here and the shop owners are back in their shops, stock up
on items and upgrade Bleu's equipment (you should end up with a Cane, LightSH,
SuedeRB, and ChainHT). Once you're done, rest at the Inn and save at the Dragon
Shrine before leaving the town.

Now that you have the almighty Sphere, it's time to exploit Gobi's
transformation ability. Place him at the front of the party as press the A
button. Gobi will raise the sphere and yell, transmuting him into a large,
quite droopy-looking fish. In this form, you cannot be attack by enemies, which
is convenient as it makes your underwater trips much faster and safer. Now,
from Prima, swim directly north to the Sea Volcano and head west from there,
over a large gap in the seafloor. Head a little west into this new area and
then go south to hit a wall. Continue west from there and you should reach a
small island with a beach on the south side of it. Press A to revert Gobi back
to his normal mode and then walk your party up the beach. Up on land, head
north into the sole city here.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Items: Rod5, Herb, Melon

First off, save at the Dragon Shrine to the left in this tropical city, and
then rest at the Inn to the right of the stairs should your party need a rest.
Now make your way up the large set of stairs and head over to the left and into
the Weapons Shop to upgrade your equipment. Grab a BoneCN and GuruCT for Bleu
and a MystRB for Nina. If you try and talk to any of the natives here, you will
only hear tunes, so they aren't much help. Simply head all the way to the north
of the city and enter the large building up here.

In this area, head north to where some natives are, then head east from there
to a bedroom with four beds. Take the path south from here and then back west
to a staircase, which you should take up a level. On this floor, head west and
down another staircase. In this area, head left to some statues and a locked
door. There are two chests on either side of the locked area. Approach the left
one and one of the statues will come alive and chase you down into a hole that
appears. If you talk to the person standing in the middle of the room here, he
will tell you that something under a box will help you make a big catch. Move
the box to the southeast of the and then examine it to obtain a Rod5. Now move
the southwestern box aside and fall down the hole here. Grab the Herb and Melon
in the chests here, then continue south and up the stairs here to exit the
city.

Now that you have the most powerful of the Rods in the game (Rod5) you can fish
for some great new equipment. I suggest going for the DragonSD and DragonHT now
as you can obtain it easily. Look under the "Dragon Sword" and "Dragon Helmet"
side-quests for how to acquire them. You can also go for the Slab now, but it
really isn't important. Once you're ready, warp to Gant and leave the city once
there. Follow the path from here south through the dead trees and then up
northeast between the mountains until you come to the beach. Take it down to
the water.

Whether you use Gobi's transforming fish ability underwater is up to you. It is
faster and you don't have to deal with enemies, but it can be a hassle if you
keep him fused to Karn. Sometimes you need to be the big fish, but I'll let you
know when that happens. No matter, head to the beach just northwest of Prima
and take it up back to land.

Follow the southern path through some dead trees and continue on southwest to
the Hidden Fort. Enter it and make the short trek through the area (if you
don't remember, find the section above) and once out on the other side, follow
the path through the mountains leading west. Continue on the path as it goes
south and back east until you come to a group of four trees. Enter the small
shrine encircled by the trees in search of your next set of dragon
transformations.

Head north into the actual shrine, and once inside, talk to the old man wearing
white garments. Like the previous shrine, he will only allow Ryu to proceed.
Heal at the spring to the left and then grab the Mrbl2 in the chest over to the
right. Now head straight up the middle of the area, up some steps to the entity
up here. It will tell you that you've completed this step if you survive this
test, and then do battle with you.

         |   What a pretty-looking boss. I love how it glimmers... |
         |   but anyways. Bain is quite a simple boss, despite its |
         |   elaborate exterior. It attacks normally each round,   |
         |   doing only about 15 damage to your hero. Your         |
         |   strategy should be quite simple as well, transform    |
         |   into the ThrDr and attack each round. If your health  |
         |   should ever drop to around 20, use a healing item,    |
         |   but you probably won't drop that low. Bain is an easy |
         |   boss to beat and after some rounds of exchanging      |
         |   blows, you should come out the victor.                |

Once the battle is over and you have defeated the spirit, it will congratulate
you and you will gain four new dragon transformation spells: IceDgn, FirDgn,
BltDgn, and GldDgn. They will be very useful to you and look really cool in
battle as well. Now heal at the spring to the left and make your way out of the
shrine with your party.

Enemies: Chimera, Warlock, Zombie

There are some new enemies you will face here so I'll give you a heads-up on
them. They are nothing too scary and you shouldn't have any trouble with them.
They give pretty decent experience, however, and you ay want to take some time
to level up. If you need a tip for beating them, most are undead enemies so you
can use Nina's Zom spells and Ryu's GldDgn is you feel like it. To reach the
next town, follow the route east to a grove of trees. Head north from there
across a stone bridge and up a ramp. Make your way just northeast of there and
into the establishment there.

                                 =-=-=-=-=-=-

                                 =-=-=-=-=-=-

To start off, head north in this town to the Dragon Shrine and Inn, which oddly
are not at the front of the town, and save your game and rest up. The Weapons
and Items Shops are over to the right, so take some time to stock up on items
upgrade your equipment. Grab the MoonBW and WorldML for Bo and a FlameSH and
WorldML for Ox, selling back your obsolete items, as the purchase of the
WorldML should drain your funds. Now head into the house just south of the Inn.
In this house, you should see a small crate to the right. Push it aside and
drop down the hole it was covering. You should now be in front of a setup of
urns in this fashion:

                                  (4)(5)(6)
                                  (2)   (3)
                                     (1)

To solve this simple puzzle and get to the room beyond, move urn 1 to the right
or left, urn 3 to the right, urn 2 to the left, both urns 4 and 6 up, and urn 5
to either the right or left, so that they should be in this order (or slightly
different depending on which way you moved urns 1 and 5):

                                  (4)   (6)
                                        (5)
                               (2)         (3)
                                        (1)

This should leave a path directly down the center to a familiar looking man
with candles on either side of him. Switch Karn[defused] to the lead of the
party and talk to this man. Since you are a member of his family line, he will
teach you the spell Debo, another fusion spell with that can only be used
underwater. Now head south and up the staircase here to get out of the city.
Reenter, however, and head all the way north and exit through the path here to
end up north of the city.

Enemies: Blaze, Buzzer, LancerX, Mimic, Rogue
Items: Herb, Cure2, L.Ptn, Rod4

Yes, there is a period after the name of the area. I don't know why, it may be
a typo; it may be intentional to convey a sense of abruptness, who knows? But I
digress...the enemies in here shouldn't give you much trouble. You may see some
rehashed Dark Dragon enemies, which aren't bad, but the Blaze here can deal the
damage with its Burn Out attack that hits your entire party for 30-40 damage a
piece. Use Bleu's water spells to douse its flame easily. To the walkthrough -
in this first room head over to the left where a chest is and a monster will
appear. Defeat this Rogue with normal attacks easily for a nice experience
bonus and then grab the Herb in the chest. All chests in this place are guarded
by these weak demons so get used to fighting them. Do the same thing over to
the right side of the room and grab the Cure2 in the chest there. Now head
straight up the center of the room to numerous different paths ahead.

Of the three rooms up ahead, the two to the right contain chest while the one
to the left does not, though I recommend going there just to fight the Rogue
that appears. Fight the Rogues in the other two rooms and grab the L.Ptn and
Rod4 in the chests. Now head back to the hallway and take it east to three more
rooms. These rooms have no chests in them, but they have breakable walls to the
north, allowing for a small shortcut. The middle room does not contain a Rogue
so if you do not want a fight, head through this room, though, again, I
recommend defeating the Rogues in the outer rooms for the experience. Either
break down one of the walls or continue east and around north and west through
the hallway as you continue on up the stairs at the end.

       !   As you come up the stairs, Cort, Jade's henchman, comes up !
       !   to you and the screen cuts to a close-up of his evil, ugly !
       !   face with the red patch over his right eye. He then        !
       !   speculates how his new formula will affect you. Back to    !
       !   the normal scene, he hits your party with the formula then !
       !   disappears as the screen flashes pink shortly. The camera  !
       !   then zooms in on your party as they shrink and the room    !
       !   around them becomes much bigger. You now regain control of !
       !   your party.                                                !

Well, you can't head down either staircase with your new shrunken-ness, so head

Enemies: Roach
Items: Herb, M.Cura

The Roaches in here aren't very strong, even in groups, so you'll have little
difficulty in this area. Take your party north and east with the linear path
until you come to some mice. One of them has a Mouse Inn service, which heals
your party for free, so use it to get a fresh start. If you talk to the others
here, you will find that "There's big trouble a brewin'." Now backtrack a
little ways and head north up a path that a mouse was previously blocking and
follow it to a fork in the path. To the west is just an area with some roach
crap so make your way east to some more roach crap. Now head north from here to
some cheese and three red bugs blocking the path. As you approach them, one
will ask if you come to steal their food. It then goes on to exclaim that it
hates humans because they always cause trouble, then enter battle with you.

         o----------o------------------------------------o---------o
         |   Though each of these foes has the traditional "extra  |
         |   HP" of a true boss (when they flash and stay alive    |
         |   even though their HP is depleted), they are so easy   |
         |   that I can't classify them as bosses. Each of them    |
         |   has a strike attack, doing around 15-25 damage to a   |
         |   single party member. Again, not true boss caliber.    |
         |   Their defense is quite low as well, as even Nina and  |
         |   Bleu can do over 150 damage to them with a normal     |
         |   attack. Your offensive strategy should be to attack   |
         |   as BltDgn with Ryu, as they don't seem to have a      |
         |   weakness, and have everyone else normally attack. As  |
         |   always, use Nina to heal whenever someone's HP gets   |
         |   low. You should be done with these vermin quickly.    |

After defeat, the cockroaches will be mad that they lost to humans and then
vanish. Now that they're gone, the mice can have their food back. Head back
south to where the mice are and talk to the one blocking the entrance to a room
with a couple chests. It will thank you and then head north into the room,
unblocking the path. Take the Herb from the chest on the right first and then
the M.Cura on the left, which will transport you out of the Mouse Hole and back
to the Lab.

Outside the Mouse Hole, your party will take the potion and revert back to
normal size. You can now head down the stairs to the west. In this lava-filled
room, ride the platform north of you across to another area. Follow this path
down and around to another floating platform, and take this west. At the split
in the path here, head south down to a platform that takes you back east to
another ledge. Head north and ride the ledge here to a square island, and take
the platform to the north here to an area with Cort and his demon, which looks
like a pinkish Rogue. Cort will say that you have come back once, but it won't
happen again as he sicks his monster on you.

         o-------------o-----------------------------o-------------o
         |   Another very simple mini-boss fight, defeating RugaX  |
         |   doesn't have much to it. You can plainly use normal   |
         |   attacks on this supped-up Rogue, which is not a bad   |
         |   idea, or do the whole routine: using BltDgn with Ryu  |
         |   and attacking with F.Ball with Bleu, or Blast if you  |
         |   have it. You could do this, but it really isn't       |
         |   necessary against such an easy boss. As for its       |
         |   offense, it has a melee strike and a projectile       |
         |   attack, both doing around 30-50 damage to one party   |
         |   member. They are relatively strong, but nothing to    |
         |   worry about. Keep up the attacks on this demon and it |
         |   will go down easily.                                  |

Items: G.Fly

Don't leave just yet, as you'll need something back in Gust. Reenter the city
and heal your party by taking a rest at the Inn. Now save at the Dragon Shrine
and then back track to the southwestern corner of the city. Make your way up
the steps here and up another flight of stairs past the goat into a cave. In
here, follow the curvy path to a fly at the end, sitting on some cheese.
Remember to change your party back to the way you want it, as Ox was switched
in upon finding Nicholie. Now as you approach the fly, it will announce that it
is hungry, but it doesn't like cheese. He then suggests eating you, and
attacks.

         o----------------o------------------------o---------------o
         |   The G.Fly isn't difficult at all and poses just about |
         |   no threat to you. Like all enemies of the fly family  |
         |   you have faced, the G.Fly is weak in defense and HP   |
         |   but has high agility. This fly also packs somewhat of |
         |   a punch as its only attack does about 40-50 damage to |
         |   one ally. Nothing big, but big for a fly nonetheless. |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   As aforementioned, the G.Fly has very penetrable      |
         |   defenses and is quite easy to take down. A few rounds |
         |   on AUTO should be enough to take this weak boss down. |
         |   Again, as when battling the RugaX, you can choose the |
         |   more powerful route with Ryu attacking as BltDgn and  |
         |   Bleu using her spells, but like before, it's not      |
         |   necessary at all. You should have G.Fly down before   |
         |   it can scratch you.                                   |

After the battle, ending in your victory over the G.Fly, your party exclaims
what a pain it was and that you should take it to the Frog. So grab the G.Fly
from the cheese and, after this, leave the cave and take one more stop at the
Inn to rest and the Dragon Shrine to save before leaving the city to the south.

Head southwest from the city and south down a dirt ramp and continue south from
there across a stone bridge. From here go southwest past the grove of trees and
follow the grass path west to a beach. Head down it underwater.

Once underwater, place Gobi at the front of your party and transform into the
large fish. From the shore, swim directly south so that you pass by the Tunlan
island to the left and come to a wall. Swim east from here and you should reach
a narrow wall. Head just north of here and back south over the rocks into this
small cove. Revert back to normal and head up the beach to the south.

Items: Oil

This is an extremely tiny cave with no enemies whatsoever and a bunch of small,
blue frogs around. Head directly north to the frog surrounded by the rocks and
he will tell you that he wants a G.Fly, a really big one, because he is hungry.
Trade him the G.Fly for the Oil and then exit the cave to the south. Back
outside, use Nina to Warp your party back to Gust.

Items: Maestro

Exit out of the Dragon Shrine and head into the second house south of you (just
to the right as you enter the city from the south). Head north to where
Nicholie is lying in bed with Bleu and Tina on either side. Talk to Bleu,
giving her the Oil, and she will sprinkle it on Nicholie. She will recover and
as she wakes up, she will mention the Flower and that if it spreads its seeds,
the whole world will go insane. Bleu tells you to dispose of the Flower while
she continues to watch over Nicholie. Bleu then looks into a Crystal Ball, but
it explodes in her face, which could be seen as a bad omen... Well exit the
house and make your way out of the city through the northern entrance.

Once outside the city, continue north into the other part of Gust and proceed
ahead to the pink flower you passed earlier when going to the Lab. Cort will be
there and he lauds your timing, as his flower is hungry (so many things that
want to eat you). It then attacks.

         |   Another one of Cort's faithful monsters, FlowerX      |
         |   poses slightly more of a threat to you than the RugaX |
         |   you defeated earlier, but is still quite easy. It     |
         |   uses two moves on you: a regular attack and a Poison  |
         |   spell. FlowerX's normal attack does about 50-60       |
         |   damage to one party member, which can hurt your       |
         |   weaker allies like Nina, so use her to stay healthy.  |
         |   It's Poison spell does just that - poison one party   |
         |   member. Nothing special, just use Nina's Heal spell   |
         |   or an Antdt to cure it before it can hurt you.        |

         |   With Bleu out of your party, your setup and strategy  |
         |   might be somewhat different. I recommend a party of   |
         |   Ryu, Karn[Shin], Ox, and Nina. Ryu should attack as   |
         |   BltDgn every round after transforming while the rest  |
         |   normally attack. Should anyone fall low in HP or get  |
         |   poisoned, have Nina use her spells. You don't really  |
         |   need any fortification spells as this boss isn't too  |
         |   hard, so just keep up the attacking.                  |

Once the battle is over, the little pink seeds once surrounding the FlowerX
disintegrate one by one, and Cort is left standing there alone. He rhetorically
asks what you have done to his Flower, but reassures himself that he won't lose
his temper over this. He then let's you go for now and vanishes. Nina suggests
going back to the city as everyone should be back to normal, and once you
regain control of the party, head back south into the city of Gust.

Make your way into the house to the southeastern house where Nicholie, Bleu,
and Tina are. Upon entering, Bleu will acknowledge that you have defeated the
Poison Flower. Nina and Gobi will then notice a monster that is causing
commotion, and then they will recognize that it is Nicholie. Bleu will say that
she made a mistake. Tina then says that if you can't make him normal, then you
should put him out of his misery. You then enter battle with the RugaX again.
Refer to my strategy above (when you fought it in the Lab.) or just attack it
normally until it falls.

       !   Once the battle is over, Bleu again tries to make Nicholie !
       !   normal by shocking him. He wakes up and is back to normal  !
       !   again as Bleu rejoices that it worked. Nicholie thanks you !
       !   and says that he will return the favor by fixing the       !
       !   bridge. He goes off as Tina thanks you, telling you to     !
       !   rest there until the bridge is done. After a short pause,  !
       !   you have control of your party again, with Bleu back in    !
       !   it.                                                        !
       -^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-^*-

Now that Bleu is back in your party, you may want to rearrange your setup back
to your liking. As always, I recommend a team of Ryu, Karn[Shin], Nina, and
Bleu. Once you are ready, exit the house and stop by the Dragon Shrine to the
north to save your progress. Now continue north out of the city and into the
mountain region of Gust. Make your way north past the entrance to the Lab. up
to a bridge heading west. Approach the Nicholie lying on the bridge and Cort
will appear once again (I'm sick of this guy). He will say that you broke the
spell, but you won't break him. As he enters battle with you, he begins to
transform.

         |   this game must really like frogs for some reason. No  |
         |   matter, HornToad's attacks are based on jumping up    |
         |   and down. He will either jump on one party member,    |
         |   doing 30-60 damage to your ally, or he will jump in   |
         |   place, enacting some sort of Quake attack that does   |
         |   anywhere from 40-70 damage to each party member.      |
         |   HornToad can wear your team down in a few rounds, so  |
         |   be sure to cure constantly with Nina, even if your HP |
         |   isn't really suffering. Stay healthy and he shouldn't |

Once you have defeated Cort/HornToad, he will exclaim that he doesn't believe
it, as he though he was stronger, and then vanish once and for all. Nicholie
will then tell you that the bridge is ready and that you can cross it to get to
Scande. Before crossing it, however, you will want to head back into town to
rest at the Inn and save at the Dragon Shrine. Now enter the house just south
of the Inn and talk to the man by the table here. He will ask if you want to
listen to his flute, telling you it is under that bed. So step into the bed and
press A to take the Maestro. Now head back up north and cross the bridge to the

Enemies: Blaze, Buzzer, Chimera, Crab, D.Knight, Warlock, Zombie, Zoom

Well there is nothing you can do up north, so take the southern path between
the water and the cliff and follow it west across a brown bridge to a dry, dirt
area. Beware of the Zoom enemies here as they can cast a Blizzard spell doing
60 damage to each member of your party and Blast that does 110 damage to one
ally. Once in the middle of the dirt area, head south a little ways and you
should see a head poking out of a hole in the ground.

Items: Cowl

As you enter the city, you will see the little boy who was peeking out of the
hole in the doorway to a room. As you approach the doorway, the boy will flee
again, so follow him into the room. In the room, head up and talk to the boy
who will tell you that his brother Mogu was brave and fought hard, but Mote was
too strong. Apparently, Mote's spell has trapped him in the World of Dreams, so
you should help him. Now talk to the person beside the bed where Mogu is and
she will ask you to retrieve an item from Tunlan in order to enter Mogu's
dream. Accept and she will give you a Cowl. Now with the Cowl and the Maestro
from Gust, you will be able to understand as well as communicate with the
Tunlanians. Now exit the room and enter the one to the right. Save at the
Dragon Statue here and then leave the underground establishment.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Items: Melon(x2), M.Drop, Bolster

Once in the city, exit the Dragon Shrine and make use of your newfound ability
to speak with the natives. Talk to some of the people around here and you will
learn of the Bolster, the treasure of Tunlan, which allows you to enter
people's dreams. Speak with the lady near the steps up to the castle and she
will tell you of the TmKey, another royal treasure, one of the goddess keys
that controls time. Now head up the stairs and enter the large building up
here. Head directly north here to a woman wearing bight green garments. Speak
with her and she will tell you that if you can solve her problem, then she will
let you have the Bolster. Agree and the woman will tell you that the princess
wants Zog to have the TmKey because she in love with him. If you change the
princess's mind, the Bolster is yours to borrow.

Once she is done speaking, the woman will move aside, unblocking the staircase,
which you should take up to the next level. In this room, you will be
surrounded by guards on three sides, not allowing you to see the princess, who
is in her pool. Well, switch Nina or Bleu to the front of the party and the
guards will be more polite, telling you that the princess is swimming so come
back tomorrow. Head down the stairs and exit the castle to the south. Now head
south down three sets of stairs and enter the doorway to the right of the last,
large staircase (the Inn). Rest here so that it is the next day, then head
north and enter the castle again. Head directly north up the stairs once again
to the princess's chambers and talk to her up ahead.

When you ask her for the TmKey, she will tell you that that is ridiculous. The
princess will go on to say that she and Zog will be forever when Tyr gives them
eternal youth. Well that was successful - head back downstairs and talk to the
woman in green who is again blocking your path. She is persistent in getting
the key even though the princess refuses to give it up. The woman mentions that
the marks on the princess's back show how to open the safe, and then she leaves
up the stairs to the southeast. Follow her up these stairs and down some more
stairs to the left to a room with the statues (the one's that came alive and
chase you down traps when you got the Rod5). Talk to the woman again, in front
of the safe, and she will say that you can see the marks on the princess's back
in the moonlight when she swims at night. Now exit out the castle and continue
south out of Tunlan. Once outside, use the HrGlas or DkKey items to switch to
night and reenter the city.

Head north and enter the castle again, and take the stairs that the woman in
green took (the ones to the right). In the next room, head left, but not down
the stairs to the vault room. You may notice a small crack at the bottom of the
western wall. Take your party through it and then make your way north into the
little space behind the palm tree that is directly south of the princess in the
pool. Press A and the screen will pan up to the princess while you read the
marks on her back: "Blue, red and white from left to right." Now head back
south and down the stairs to the room with the woman in green and the safe.
Talk to the woman in front of the safe and she will tell you to try the left
door first. Head up to it and press A to push in the blue and red stars. The
old woman then tells you to try the right. So head over to the right and press
A, pushing the white star. It doesn't work, however, and the woman realizes
that you saw the marks in a reflection, so you should reverse the order.

       !   Bleu and the princess bicker about how old they are. The   !
       !   quarrel between the two, which eventually involves Nina as !

       !   Karn watch on. During the fight, Karn yells for them to    !
       !   stop, Nina gets kicked out but rejoins, and then Bleu      !

       !   and tells her that, though the key is gone, the princess   !

Talk to the old woman in green again and she will tell you that the Bolster is
in the safe downstairs. Well, switch Ryu back to the front of your party in the
menu first off, then head west all the way to the destroyed safe room (you can
reach it now because the western wall is destroyed). Grab the two Melons from
the middle chests and then take the M.Drop and Bolster from the outside chests,
but approach them from the side, as you know there are trap holes just south of
each chest. Well, that's all you can do here, so exit the town, saving at the
Dragon Shrine on your way out.

Once here, exit the Dragon Shrine room and enter the one jus northwest of it,
where Mogu is. Head up and talk to the person beside his bed, who will allow
you to enter Mogu's dream using the Bolster. Accept and the screen will flash
yellow and then become wavy.

The scene will then switch to your party in a bed as two men approach you,
asking who you are and where you come from. They continue on, asking if you
have a Bolster, and tell you that they can't get rid of the spell-casting
monster, which is in the North Tower. Now get out of bed and exit the house.
Once outside, you may notice the odd coloring of things. I guess Mogu dreams of
a world with different colors. Anyways, you can talk to the people here, who
are Mogu's different emotions: Sorrow, Anger, Fear, Humor, and Reason. They
give you no help but Reason mentions that Mogu will be whole again when these
emotions are united again. Now enter the Dragon Shrine to the north and save
there, then exit the town.

Enemies: Buzzer, Chimera, WraithX

The new WraithX that you will come across out here aren't very much of a
threat, though bearing a resemblance to the S.Riders. They have some enhancing
spells and degenerating spells but they aren't that strong. Anyhow, follow the
path to the east and take it north then back west to a large tower and enter
it.

Enemies: Blaze, Chopper, D.Knight, Warlock, Zoom

The monsters in this dungeon are nothing you haven't face before, so you know
how to defeat them. Keep your team healthy, however, as they can wear you down
with time. This tower has a little twist to it. There are red and blue switches
on the ground throughout the area. Stepping on the blue switches results in the
walls becoming invisible, while the red switches make them appear once again.
As you enter the tower, step north onto the blue switch, and then head east
from there to a red switch. Continue on this path east, following it as it goes
north, east, and then north again. When you come to a blue switch and a path
heading west, head that way to a split in the path. Head south from here and
follow this path west and a blue switch, making the walls disappear.

From the switch, walk nineteen(19) steps to the left and then head north on a
path that should be there. Now from that first step north on the new path, walk
up four(4) more steps, and then head east on another path that you can't really
see. Now take your party east as far as you can, and then north over a red
switch near a staircase with a little boy standing at the bottom. Talk to him
and he will say that as long as Mogu's senses are scattered, you won't have a
chance against him. When he challenges you, say no (you could say yes and fight
Mothro, which the boy transforms into, but you cannot damage him right now so
your attempt would be futile). The boy will laugh at you, but ignore him and
use Bleu's Exit spell to quickly get out of there.

Make your way east, south, and then back west to the Dream Town, where a girl
is standing, not allowing you to enter the city. The girl, named Anne, tells
you that she has found where Courage, Mogu's last "sense," is. She tells you to
follow her as she goes into the town, so enter it.

Enter the house in the center of the town, where you first came into the Dream
World and talk to the men there. One will tell you that one of Mogu's
attributes is being held in South Cave, while the other lets you know that a
man fixed the bridge to the South. Well rest at the Inn in the northwestern
house and save at the Dragon Shrine to the right of there, then leave the town.

Continue on as it turns east and north through some dark blue rocks.

Enemies: Buzzer, WarHogX, Wraith, WraithX, Zoom
Items: LightSH, Life, HeadGear

The enemies that you encounter in here aren't too difficult. The WarHogX are
strong but it doesn't take too much to take them down. They give good
experience, however. The rest of the enemies you know how to deal with. In this
desolate area, try to always stay on the path (the uncracked land). If you step
to the sides, steam comes out of the cracks, which takes 2 HP from your lead
party member (no big deal). Follow the linear path as it winds north, going
east and west on the way up. Eventually, as you are heading west, you will come
to a fork in the path. Here is nothing to the west so make your way north a
couple steps to another split. Follow the path east first and take it around to
a chest containing a LightSH.

Now go back and continue on the path going west. Follow it as it heads
generally up north, though on another curvy path. Eventually, you will come to
an open area. If you try to go immediately north, steam will prevent you, so
head east for now. Here are more hidden "steam walls" in this area, so be
cautious as you make your way east and then back southwest. Follow this linear
path down to a chest with a Life, and continue on to another chest containing
some HeadGear. Now carefully make your way back up to the open area and weave
your way up north past the "steam wall" and then make your way west to another
open area. Carefully, weave your way north through more invisible "steam walls"
up to the exit.

       !   you see is only substance...not form (good psychology).    !
       !   After he says this, Anne and a Wise man (probably the one  !
       !   who built the bridge) will tell you that Courage is        !
       !   depressed. When the two try to encourage Courage, he will  !
       !   still be depressed. Anne and the Wise man eventually give  !
       !   up and leave as Reason comes in and joins his body with    !
       !   Courage. He is followed by Humor, Sorrow, Fear, and Anger, !
       !   who also join with Courage to form the complete Mogu. He   !
       !   then regains his courage, saying that he will do his best, !

Head south back into the Wilderness and tediously make your way back through
this short area. Once outside again, make your way west, north across the
bridge, and then east back to the Dream Town. Stop by here to rest up at the
Inn to replenish your HP and AP and save at the Dragon Shrine, and then leave.
Now head east, then north, and back west into the Devil Tower once again now
that you have a united Mogu with you.

Follow the same path you took before to get to where the boy at the stairs is.
Take the path east up north and then follow the path you come to heading west
to a fork. Follow the southern path at this fork down to a blue switch. Take
nineteen steps west from the blue switch, and then five up from there. At this
point, make your way east and then north to where the boy is at the foot of the
staircase. Talk to the boy again he will say that just because you found
Courage doesn't mean you've won. He goes on to tell you that he will be at the
top of the tower and to get him if you dare. Well, head up the stairs that he
was blocking. On this floor, follow the path south, over a red switch, as it
goes around and back up north a long ways to a blue switch. Continue north as
far as you can, and then make your way east as far as you can.

Now head south until you hit a wall and afterwards, take your team west then
north over a red switch. With visible walls again, take the first path west
that you come to. Follow it up north and take the staircase at the end of the
hallway. On this next floor Head around the spiral to a zigzag path heading
south. On your way down, you will walk over a blue switch. Just continue
heading east and south down to a group of three blue switches with a red switch
to the south. Stand in the center of the three blue switches and make your way
east until you hit a wall. From here, go north as far as you can, and then west
as far as you can. Now take five steps to the north and then head east until
you can go no further. Now take the party north over a red switch and continue
on that path up to another staircase at the end, which you should take up a
floor.

In this area, follow the linear path through many red and blue switches until
you reach the boy at the end, healing up for a boss battle. Approach him and he
will mention that fighting in the Dream World is not as same as it is in the
Real World. He will then battle you as he begins to morph.

                         |   Boss Battle: MOTHRO   |
         o---------------o-------------------------o---------------o
         |   Despite what the boy said, battling here is little    |
         |   different than in the Real World. The only            |
         |   differences I noticed was that Mothro doesn't have a  |
         |   health meter, so you won't know how far along you are |
         |   to defeating him, and the background is completely    |
         |   black - nothing special. Mothro's attacks aren't too  |
         |   special either, as all he mostly does is poison. But  |
         |   when he gets low in HP, he will attempt his Shock     |
         |   spell, that does over 600 damage to one person, so    |
         |   essentially, Shock = instant kill. He uses some other |
         |   magic effect attacks that do no damage, but beware of |
         |   this Shock attack. It hits about 50% of the time but  |
         |   have Nina cast Shield on everyone to lessen the blow. |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Your strategy should be the same as always if you     |
         |   have kept my recommended team of Ryu, Karn[Shin],     |
         |   Nina, and Bleu. If you put Mogu in your party just    |
         |   for kicks, which you really shouldn't, just have him  |
         |   attack normally each round. Ryu should use his        |
         |   powerful BltDgn transformation to hit Mothro for 200+ |
         |   damage each round while Karn[Shin] should attack      |
         |   normally, while Bleu should use her IceX spell,       |
         |   should she have it. If not, use her most powerful     |
         |   spell each round. Nina, as always, has many tasks.    |
         |   Protect the team by casting Shield on each ally while |
         |   using Heal on anyone who has become afflicted with a  |
         |   status ailment. If anyone should fall to the Shock    |

Once you defeat the boy/Mothro, he will say that you're still trapped in this
world forever even though you beat him. He then disappears as the screen
flashes green and becomes wavy as you are transported back by Mogu's bedside.

Ha, so much for being stuck in the Dream World forever...stupid Mothro. Back in
the real world with Mogu still unconscious in his bed, the person by the
bedside will notice you and thank you for saving her grandson. Mogu then wakes
up and says that he had a dream...and Ryu and company was in it. He goes on to
say that it didn't seem like a dream at all. He then joins the party again.
After the musical interlude, exit the dwelling and continue up the stairs out
of the area.

Well, now that you have Mogu, you can exploit his special Digging ability to
unearth hidden items at those dirt patches that you've seen. You can find the
first two sets of items right now as they are in areas you have explored, and
I'll let you know when you can reach the last three places. Check out the
"Digging for Treasure" side-quest for where to find these items. I highly
suggest finding the Doof transformation spell for Karn, as you'll need it to
get his final transformation spell. When you're done getting that, use Nina's
or Bleu's Warp spell to quickly get to Bleak.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=

Items: ClearCL

In the town, exit the Dragon Shrine and enter the wide, white house just north
of it. To the left, inside the house, you should notice a large crate and two
large jars blocking a staircase. Put Karn[Doof] at the front of your party and
push the large crate north and then move the southern jar to the left. Now head
down the stairs. In this small, enclosed area, you will notice two barrels to
the left. Push the left one upward and the right one either to the left or
right to reach another large crate. Use Karn[Doof] to push it up and then
examine it to find the ClearCL.

Equip the armor on Nina and then head back up the stairs to the south. Back
upstairs, push the jar in front of you south and then head up to the
southwestern part of the house, where another large crate is. As Karn[Doof],
push it aside, causing your party to fall into the hole it was covering. Revert
Karn back to normal and talk to the man here, who will successfully teach you
the Puka transformation spell, as Karn is of his family line. This final spell
for Karn fuses him with Bo, Ox, and Gobi and gives him an assload of HP. Now
that you have this powerful spell, use it, and then exit the city up the stairs
to the south.

                              =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Try out this strong new transformation that gives Karn over 800HP, even though
it looks like a little flying Gonzo (from the Muppets). Anyways, you can
exploit its special ability to open those stone walls that you have seen on the
side of cliffs. You can access the first two right now to get some bracelets,
so look for where they are in the "Open Sesame" side-quest. Once you're
finished, have Nina or Bleu Warp the party back to Gramor and then exit up the
stairs and out of the underground area. Make your way south from the hole in
the dry earth and enter the cave down here.

Enemies: Buzzer, D.Flea, M.Flea, Nautulis

Well now that you have all of Karn's fusion spells, you should keep him in his
Puka form, as it is the strongest by far. A good party to use is Ryu,
Karn[Puka], Nina, and Bleu. Once you're done with your party setup, walk
straight ahead and down the stairs in this cave. You'll see some new enemies
here, but they aren't very strong at all. In this next area, make your way
along the area east, south, east again, and south again, all the way under an
overpass to the exit.

You'll notice a scenery change in this new area - everything seems to be cold
and snowy. Well that's about al that is new, as the enemies are much of the
same as you've seen before. For now, just head west from the cave exit into the
town there.

Items: Herb

First off, head east to the Inn and heal your entire party there, then visit
the Dragon Shrine to the right and save your progress. Now head northwest of
there to the Weapons Shop and upgrade your party's equipment. Grab an IronCW as
well as some QuartzAR for Mogu, as well as a QuartzAR for Karn, and then sell
back your obsolete equipment. Now visit the Items Shop if you need any
supplies, and then head to the long house south of the two shops. Talk to the
residents here and they will tell you that the tower Spyre controls the climate
and has made the place very cold. Now open the chest of drawers near the middle
of the north wall for an Herb if you wish, and then exit the house, continuing
east out of the town.

From outside the town, head south along the frozen riverbank and follow it west
and around up north to a large tower. Briefly put Mogu at the front of the
party and stand on the familiar dirt patch with the dragon symbol on it. Press
A to dig down beneath the ground into the tower.

Enemies: Ameblob, Blurb, Buzzer, Cactus, Creep, BlazeX, Buzzer, D.Flea, Flea,
         Flower, D.Knight, M.Flea, Phoenix, Prickle, SandClod, Scorp, Slime,
         Warlock, Wraith, WraithX, Zard, Zombie, Zoom,
Items: Cure2, Shell, A.Ptn, FlameAR, WorldAR

Well that was an odd way to enter a tower. Anyways, reconfigure your party to
make it optimal for battle (take Mogu out, or leave him in if you like him).
The enemies in this first part of the tower can be tough, especially the Blaze,
who is difficult to bring down and has a Blast spell that damages your entire
party. It only gives a little over 1000 experience points too! The D.Flea in
here can appear in groups of up to five, which can be somewhat overwhelming. Be
sure to utilize Bleu's spells to make quick work of them. Back to the
walkthrough - to start off in this tower, make your way directly north through
a long hallway and down the staircase at the end.

In this purple room filled with water, make your way south first, down a few
steps and head west at the fork here, Follow this path all the way north and
back east to a chest with a Cure2. Now head west, south, and east back to the
fork and continue east on the path until you come to another path heading
north. Follow this lighter-colored path up to a T and continue east here. Keep
with this path as it turns south down some more steps and comes to some natural
ground. Head here down a ramp and grab the Shell and A.Ptn in the two chests
here. Make your way back up the ramp and take the bridge across west to an area
with many pillars. Before heading up the steps in the middle, continue on west
across another bridge to a small butte with a couple chests. Grab the FlameAR
and WorldAR in the chests and then head back to the pillar area. Give the
FlameAR to Mogu and the WorldAR to OX, and then make your way up the stairs in
the middle of the area. Now, take the party up the stairs to the left in the
next area to reach a large, yellow-green room.

In this massive area you will encounter some enemies that you first fought at
the start of the game. Well just brush them off and head east to a raised
platform and take the stairs on it to reach a similar large room, though black
and rainy this time. Again you will encounter some older enemies, such as the
Ameblob, Blurb, and Zard, but ignore them and seek out the stairs to the
southwest. Once you find them, take them up to a sandy room (if you haven't
noticed, these rooms resemble different climates. Make your way through the
enemies of the desert to the staircase to the southwest and take it up to
another large room of snow. Fight through the more recent enemies here and head
north from the staircase to another staircase, which you should take up another
floor. The ground in this room is kinda cool with the moving clouds and all.
You'll fight a new enemy here, Phoenix, a fiery bird that looks cool but is not
very hard to defeat. Head to the southwest corner of the room and up another
staircase here. On this final floor with the universe as the ground, head just
northeast to another raised platform with a large block switch and a pillar
with a blue orb on top to the right.

If you walk around this off-colored village and talk to some of the
inhabitants, you will learn that they too have been trapped here by Mote when
ascending the Spyre tower. You learn that the only means of escape is by
defeating Mote, and that his conscience can lead you to him. If you talk to the
spirit over to the right, it will tell you that it is the guardian of the
SkyKey. Well, that's basically all you need to know so take a rest at the Inn
and save at the pink Dragon Shrine as well before departing from the city.

The good thing about this dream overworld is that there are no enemies to deal
with. It is quite a small area, though. Well the tower you need to get to is
just about north of where you are, but to get there, follow the path southwest
from the town and take it south between the edge of the area and a cliff to
your right. When you see a ramp to the south heading up to this elevated area,
take it and follow the linear path north-northeast until you reach the upper
right corner. Make your way west from there until you can go no further and
then proceed south, then east to a cave. Enter it.

Enemies: Bain, Blaze, Buzzer, D.Flea, D.Knight, M.Flea, Nautulis, Warlock,
Wraith, WraithX
Items: Cure, JadeBW, L.Ptn, Trident, Smoke, CursedHT, FaceMask

In this first room, simply take your party north and down the staircase here.
You will encounter enemies in this next area, but you've dealt with them all in
Spyre so it should be nothing new. Make your way directly north, past a path
heading east, heading down the staircase at the end of the hallway. In this
next room, follow the path west, north, and back east until you reach a path
heading south. Make your way down here to four chests. Grab the Cure, JadeBW,
L.Ptn, and Trident. Give the Trident to Gobi and the JadeBW to Bo, and then
drop down the hole in the center of the area, as a gate has risen to the north,
blocking the entrance/exit to this little alcove. In this next large room
below, simply head up the stairs to the right to get back to another area of
the room you were previously in. Follow the path east and down southwest,
heading up the staircase at the end of the path.

Now, back in the first part of the tower, make your way west to a fork in the
path, and head north and down the stairs at the end of the hallway. Again,
follow the path west, north, and around to the east, this time passing the path
heading south to the chests. Continue on, taking the stairs at the end of the
pathway. On this following floor, grab the Smoke, CursedHT, and FaceMask from
the three chests to your right and equip the CursedHT to either Nina or Bleu.
Now head north from there and follow the path as it goes west to a split. Take
the northern route up to a little person know as Mote's Conscience. He will
break down the wall to the cave ahead of you and then move aside, allowing you
to pass through. If you talk to him again, he will implore you to fight Mote
while he still has energy. Well pass through the new entrance and head up the
stairs in the room beyond.

In the following small room, there are two springs, one on either side of the
room, which you can drink from to heal your entire party. The urn in the center
of the room on the raised platform serves as a Dragon Shrine, so once you're
healed up, save your game, and then head through the doorway to the north. This
next area is kind of strange. It is completely black except for a transparent
path before you. Also, the path is littered with spinning tiles that twist the
path multiple times and tries to screw you up. You can keep a good eye on how
the path is spinning so that you don't get turned around, or you can simply
just follow my simple walkthrough. Head directly north until you hit a spinning
tile, and then continue west once the path stops spinning. Upon hitting the
next spinning tile, make your way south, west, and north on the path to the
next spinning tile. Now once you stop rotating, continue on way north up to
another spinning tile and from here, head east a short ways.

When you come to a path leading south, take it and follow it as it goes east to
a fork. Now take the southern path to yet another spinning tile. When you stop
spinning around, make your way west, past a southbound path, until you come to
another spinning tile. Continue on west after you stop and pass one path
heading north, taking the next one you come to up, left and back down to a
final spinning tile. Once it stops, continue on west and north a ways to a
different-looking tile that will transport your party to a different area with
a bunch of rats on top of the walls. Anyways, head north up to a fork in the
path, with the left path leading to a yellow tile with a staircase behind it
and the right one leading to a purple tile with a staircase. Take the right
path, heading up the stairs at the end. Passing over the purple tile makes the
screen flicker slightly as if you are taking damage but it doesn't appear to do
anything.

In this room, take one step to the west and then make your way south, over the
yellow tiles until you are one step from the southern wall. Now make your way
east until you fall into a trap near the eastern wall. Back in the room below,
though in another section, simply head north up the set of stairs and head left
up the next set of stairs on the following floor. In this good-sized room with
many pillars and purple tiles, simply make your way to the southwest corner of
the room and up the staircase there. This small room has five sets of stairs in
it, four of which lead back to the first room after the black room with the
spinning tiles. Make your way up the southeastern set of stairs to get to the
next area, and once there, take a few steps north and to come across Mote. He
will call you foolish outsiders and say how dare you come to his world to fight
him. He transforms as he enters battle with you.

                          |   Boss Battle: MOTE   |
         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Defeating Mote can take a while, especially if you    |
         |   don't know how to beat him effectively. To start off  |
         |   with his arsenal of attacks, it is not great, but it  |
         |   can deal out some damage efficiently. His normal      |
         |   isn't strong at all, inflicting a measly 20-40 on one |
         |   party member. He also uses an Inferno attack,         |
         |   however, that does over 100 and up to 150 damage to   |
         |   a single ally! This is a large amount of damage, but  |
         |   you can counter it easily the next round with a Cura3 |
         |   spell from Nina. This battle is one of the longer     |
         |   ones, so keep your party healthy throughout to        |
         |   outlast Mote.                                         |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Okay, defeating Mote successfully will take a much    |
         |   different strategy than any previous battles that you |
         |   have fought. At first, you can't damage him, so just  |
         |   him Mote with normal attacks for the first one or two |
         |   rounds until the battle stops as Mote taunts you,     |
         |   saying that you can't touch him. His Conscience       |
         |   arrives just then from the stairs behind you, telling |
         |   you to hurry and attack him while he blocks Mote's    |
         |   power. Mote then exchanges words with his Conscience  |
         |   and the battle ensues.                                |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Now, you should notice that Mote is quite blurred by  |
         |   ginormous pixels. Each time you attack with a normal  |
         |   attack, these pixels will get smaller and more        |
         |   numerous, essentially unblurring his image. Each time |
         |   Mote becomes less blurred, normal attacks do slightly |
         |   less damage, until he is fully clear, when normal     |
         |   attacks have little effect on him. When this occurs,  |
         |   however, magic attacks work fully against him,        |
         |   whereas they work crappily on him when he is the      |
         |   slightest bit blurred. To do effective damage to      |
         |   Mote each round, continue to attack regularly with    |
         |   all allies until he is completely unblurred. Then,    |
         |   continue to attack normally with everyone except Bleu |
         |   who should use her strongest spell (hopefully you     |
         |   have NovaX by now) on Mote. Keep pattern up, healing  |
         |   every so often with Nina, until Mote falls.           |

then talk to some of the people around here who are happy again now that Spring
has come. Now make your way up to the Items Shop and you should notice some
steps leading down into the river that is now unfrozen and flowing. I recommend
going for the next piece of Dragon equipment now that you have access to the
river. Check out the "Dragon Armor" side-quest for information on how to get
the armor nearby, and once you're finished, head north and into the little
entrance beyond the waterfall ahead.

Out here, head down the path south and a little west, following the mountain
range to the right of you. When the mountains stop going to the south, continue
heading down to a little group of trees and enter the town to the east of the
small forest.

Items: W.Ant, RubyRG

To start off in this little town, save at the Dragon Shrine just to the
northeast and then check out the town. You will probably notice that most of
the inhabitants won't speak to you, or even move. Heck, the livestock in the
little barn to the northwest don't even move. There is one guy near the middle
of the area who is moving, however, so talk to him and he will tell you that
upon returning to the town a few days ago, has found that time has stopped. He
also mentions Tock to the east. Now head into the house just north of the
Weapons Shop (with the windmill) and head up to the second floor. Make your way
directly left and push the little barrel there to the left, and then examine it
for a W.Ant. Keep this item as you will need it in the future. Now exit the
house and, if you choose, enter the Inn to the south. Head to the northern part
in here and check the chest of drawers for a RubyRG. Well, that's all for now,
so simply exit the town.

Now that you're here, you can now find the third and final of the sealed stone
doors and the fourth dirt patch. For more specific details as to their
locations, check out the "Open Sesame" and "Digging for Treasure" side-quests,
respectively. Once you're finished, take the party south from Carmen, and then
east around another small forest. Upon reaching a dead tree along the path,
continue on northeast and then north up a ramp that you come to. Now head back
west and take the southern path at the fork. When you reach another ramp, take
it up north and then switch either Bo, Karn[Shin], or Karn[Doof] to the front
of the party and head northeast through the trees and into the large tower
here.

Enemies: Buzzer, DogFishX, D.Rider, FireHead, Widow, Wraith, WraithX
Items: Life, EvilCN, IcyAR, Cure, G.Tiara, GuardSH, Life2, AgileHT, WolfSkin

The enemies that you will find in here are mostly ones that you have
encountered before, save the FireHead's, which aren't much of a threat to you
even in groups. Anyways, once inside the tower, you will have a choice of three
paths before you. Take the one directly ahead under the overpass. You will come
to a circle of tiles with arrows on them. Upon stepping on one of these tiles,
your party will be transported two spaces in the direction of the arrow on the
tile. There is nothing to do with this formation, so just head north past it
and drink from the clean water ahead to fully heal your party. Now make your
way west from there and south down to a teleportation tile. Step on it to get
past the wall to the west and then had north from there along the linear path
up to a chest with a Life. Now continue on east and north again to another
chest containing an EvilCN. After equipping the weapon to Bleu, head all the
way back southwest and hit the teleportation tile here to get west through
another wall.

Now follow the path up north past a teleportation tile, through some columns
and under an overpass to another chest. Grab the IcyAR here and equip it to Bo.
Once you're done with that, hit the teleportation tile to the right to get east
past the wall, and then take your team up north to another tile to get back
west. In this area, simply step on the tile here to be teleported further west
past another wall, and then head up the stairs here. In this area, head to the
northwest and grab the Cure in the chest in the little room here. Now head to
the northeast and onto the tile here to be teleported east into a narrow
hallway. Now head south onto another tile that takes you east into another open
room. Head east in this empty space over to another tile, bringing you east
outside the room. Make your way north over another tile and then follow this
linear hallway all the way around the area, going west to the wall, south to
the wall, back east to another wall, and then north to a teleportation tile. In
the room that the tile transports you to, head north up the stairs here.

On this next floor of the tower, grab the G.Tiara in the chest nearby and then
step on the teleportation tile to the southwest to get down from the raised
platform. Now head all the way west past some steps and then north up to a
teleportation tile, which brings you up to another raised platform to the left.
Grab the GuardSH in the chest up here, equip it to Gobi, and then step on the
teleportation tile here to get back down to the right. Now head up further
north to another chest and open it for a Life2. Now head back south and west,
and then north up the steps you passed, continuing north up the stairs ahead.
Now this next room can be a bit confusing as there are many teleportation
tiles, two chests in the room, and the staircase that you need to reach in the
opposite corner of the room. Start off by going west from the stairs to the
wall and then all the way north to the northwest corner of the room. Now take
ten steps to the east and then two steps to the south to be teleported back
west. Now take one step to the right and another two steps south to be
teleported west once again, into the middle of four teleportation tiles.

Take one step south onto a tile, which will take you further west, and then a
step to the left onto another tile teleporting you south. Step on the tile just
to the left of you here and you will be teleported into the middle of a circle
of tiles with a chest here. Take one step west and grab the AgileHT in the
chest to the north, equip it to Karn, and then take another step west to be
transported north out of the circle. Now take a step to the left and then head
north all the way up to the wall again. Take ten steps to the east once again
and then two steps south onto a teleportation tile taking you west, just like
you did the first time. Again following the first path, take a step east and
then two steps to the south to be teleported west and then a step south on
another tile to get further west. Now take a couple steps to the south onto a
tile that will take you east. Now take one step south to be teleported to the
right, and afterwards, take a step to the right to be transported to the south.
From here, step east on a tile taking you east and then north onto a tile that
will take you back west into the area with the second chest. Take the WolfSkin
from the chest to the north here and equip it to Bo.

To get to the stairs from here, take a step south onto a teleporter taking you
east, and then step once to the east onto a tile transporting you south. Now
take a couple more steps to the east, hitting a teleportation tile up north.
Step north from here onto another tile that takes you north, and then take
another step north to be teleported west across a wall. Simply head north up
the stairs from here. On this floor, head west a little and then up north to
where Cerl is.

       !   that "Ryu and his companions are caught in the middle."    !

First off, switch out Bo for Karn and refuse him with the Puka transformation
spell. Now take the party south from Carmen, and then east around another small
forest. Upon reaching a dead tree along the path, continue on northeast and
then north up a ramp that you come to. Now head back west and take the southern
path at the fork. When you reach another ramp, take it up north and then switch
either Bo, Karn[Shin], or Karn[Doof] to the front of the party and head
northeast through the trees and back into Tock.

To quickly get back up to where Cerl is, head directly north, around the
teleportation tiles and heal at the clean water here. Now head west and south
onto a teleporter. Head north northeast from here up a narrow hallway, past a
couple opened chests, to another teleportation tile, taking you west. Take the
path here north, west, and then south to another westbound teleportation tile,
and head up the stairs in the next area. Head northeast to a teleporter, south
to another teleporter, and then further east to another teleportation tile.
Follow the long path around the room north to the wall, west to the wall, south
to the wall, back east to the wall, and north up to a teleportation tile. In
this area, head north up the staircase. Here, head southwest onto the
teleporter, and then west and north up to the stairs.

On this floor, head west to the wall, north to the wall, ten steps east, two
steps south onto a tile, one step east, two steps south onto a tile, one step
south onto a tile, two steps south onto a tile, one step south onto a tile, one
step east onto a tile, another step east onto a tile, yet another step east
onto a tile, two more steps east onto a tile, one step north onto a tile,
another step north onto a tile, and then up the stairs to the north. Now head
west and north up to where Cerl and Alan are. Cerl will notice Alan, and Alan
will try to get her to remember their childhood days together. She will say yes
but then laugh and strike Alan back, saying that her memories are lost and that
she's learned to be tough to survive. She continues on saying that she'll
destroy anything in her way, morphing as she enters battle with you.

                          |   Boss Battle: CERL   |
         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Wow, for a supposedly tough boss, Cerl is quite easy. |
         |   She has a single attack that does around 50 damage to |
         |   a single party member. She also has some spells that  |
         |   do no damage but can enhance herself or disable a     |
         |   party member from battling for a round. Her spells    |
         |   are nothing special, and Cerl really can't hurt you,  |
         |   so this battle should be a piece of cake for you.     |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Your strategy should not be complex at all, as Cerl   |
         |   doesn't have a great amount of HP and you are not in  |
         |   any rush to defeat her. I simply just put my party on |
         |   AUTO and let them beat Cerl with normal attacks. Even |
         |   with this simple strategy, Cerl should be downed      |
         |   fairly quickly and before she can do relatively any   |
         |   damage to you. You could use some elaborate strategy  |
         |   with Ryu attacking as BltDgn, and Bleu using her      |
         |   powerful spells, but it really isn't necessary. Just  |
         |   keep up attacking with Ryu, Karn[Puka], Nina, and     |
         |   Bleu, and when Cerl gets low on HP, the battle will   |
         |   end without any reward.                               |

       !   "caught in the middle" once again as you are warped        !

       !   seal of magic. Cerl withdraws into the castle as a message !

Save at the Dragon Shrine here and then exit the building once you're finished.
You will see the some of the rest of your party walking around the town, while
the rest of the inhabitants are still motionless. Talk to Mogu and he will tell
you that though time has stopped in the town, the people are still aging. Now
enter the house just north of the fountain in the center of town. Bleu, Ox, and
Bo are here tending to Alan in the bed who says that he is to be blamed for
what Cerl is now. He goes on about how he should have protected her when others
rejected her because she isn't human. The party wants to help him help Cerl,
however, and Alan says that she'll remember the Fruit from a Holiday Tree,
which she loved. Bleu suggests that you get the Fruit and go see Cerl in the
south castle and the party is transported out of the town.

Remember that large tree where you were warped to when you encountered Cerl at
Tock the first time? Well that tree bears the fruit that Cerl loves. So take
your party south and then east around the little forest you come to. Just after
you pass a dead tree, take the ramp heading south and then follow the dirt path
back west to where the tree is. Place Ox at the front of the party and stand in
front of the tree. Press A while facing it to punch the tree, making the Fruit
pop out to the side. Head over and pick it up and then follow the dirt path as
it goes east and south. Once it ends, head south in through the path between
the mountains and follow it as it turns east back to the castle. Enter it.

Back in this island town, go straight ahead up the wide steps and then make
your way northeast and up the steps here, continuing ahead into a doorway. You
will find Nina in his house, so talk to her. She will not say much so talk to
the two residents of the house and you will find out that she has amnesia. Now
exit the house and make your way back south to where the Dragon Shrine is. Talk
to the strangely dressed figure to the left of the shrine and he will mention a
famous doctor in Carmen. Now exit the city.

Save at the Dragon Shrine once you get here and then exit the building, making
your way into the Inn to rest up (it's been a while since you've rested at an
Inn). Now exit the Inn and head into the Weapons Shop just to the northeast;
now that time is back to normal in the town, the shop owners have returned to
their positions. The items are quite expensive here, so hopefully you've got
some cash on you. Grab an IcyCW for Mogu, the FlameSD for Ryu, the LoyalRP for
Nina (when you get her back), a PowerHT for Karn and Gobi, and a MystSH for Ox.
Sell back your older items and once you're done equipping, leave the building.
Now enter the tall building north of the Weapons Shop (with the spinning
windmill), and talk to the old man in green once there. He will tell you that
the Tonic is effective at curing amnesia, and that it contains P.Fish, Root,
C.Nut, and W.Ant. Well you should already have the W.Ant when you found it in
this town earlier, so we must find the other three for the doctor. Exit the
town for now.

Items: P.Fish, C.Nut, Root

Lead the party south and east around the small bunch of trees you come to. Take
the first ramp heading south that you come to, and the follow the dirt path it
leads you to east and south. When it ends, continue south and east through the
mountains to where the South Castle used to be. Enter the area and you will
watch a flashback of when Cerl was younger, telling another boy that she will
marry Alan when she grows up. Once they run off, continue north out of the area
and then follow the path between the mountains as it turns south. When you
reach a dirt path, follow it west and then south down to a broken bridge. Step
on the edge of the bridge and equip Ryu with the Rod5 and some bait. Fish there
and you should catch a P.Fish. Once you've gotten it, equip Ryu with the ETC
items he originally had on, and then have Bleu Warp the party to Tunlan.

Once there, exit the city and switch Ox to the front of the group. Punch any of
the palm trees here by pressing A while facing them and a C.Nut will pop out.
Pick it up once it comes out and then uses Bleu Warp spell to quickly get to
Gramor. Exit the Dragon Shrine and continue up the stairs to the left to get
out of the underground establishment, and once outside, make your way southwest
and you should find a weird plant with curvy leaves...or petals. Stand on the
dirt patch in front of it and switch Mogu to the front of the party. Press A to
dig down in the earth and you should find a Root. Once you have all three of
these items (and the W.Ant you already have), Warp the party back to Carmen,
courtesy of Bleu.

Items: Tonic, Pass

Enter the house with the windmill just north of the Weapons Shop once again and
talk to the old doctor in green. Give him all of the ingredients and he will
give you the Tonic after a short fading of the screen. Well leave the house and
head just northeast, near a water container, and you should see the same
mysterious figure that you saw at Tunlan. Talk to him again and he will tell
you to search where he is standing. Once he leaves, step to where he was and
press A to find a Pass, which you will need later. Now leave the town.

Exit the Dragon Shrine and head north up the wide steps, continuing up the
right set of steps on the next level. Enter the doorway straight ahead and your
party will rush up, giving Nina the Tonic. She will regain her memory and ask
why you are staring at her. Karn will verify her recovery from amnesia and Nina
will say that she feels great...and she can fly (where did that come from?).
She rejoins your party, so configure it to fit your desires (as always I
recommend Ryu, Karn[Puka], Nina, and Bleu) and then leave the town.

Now that Nina can turn into a bird and fly, you can now obtain the final Dragon
item as well as finish the fourth and fifth parts of the "Digging for Treasure"
side-quest. Check that as well as the "Dragon Shield" side-quest to find these
items, and once you're finished, have Nina or Bleu Warp the party to Gust. Once
there, leave the town and press A with Nina at the front of the party to
transform into the large bird. Fly just northeast until you spot a large
waterfall, and then land on the small island north of the waterfall, with a
large castle, and enter it.

Items: Melon

Once here, continue straight ahead into the temple itself, and then switch Ryu
back to the lead of your party. Talk to the old man up ahead in here and he
will allow Ryu alone to pass beyond. Before challenging the spirit ahead of
you, grab the Melon in the chest over to the right and then heal at the clean
water fountain to the left. Now talk to the spirit on the raised platform in
the center of the room and it will battle you.

         |   bird has one attack, which is launching some sore of  |
         |   fireball at you, doing about 40 damage each time. It  |
         |   attacks first every round, however, so do not wait    |

         |   item, or any other healing item to stay fresh         |
         |   whenever you drop to about 60-70 HP. Keep this up and |

Once you defeat the entity, it will congratulate you, telling you that your
training is complete. It will then leave, telling you to use your powers to
restore peace to the world, and bestow upon you the Rudra dragon transformation
spell. Now head back south and talk to the old man again who will allow you to
rejoin the party, and then continue south out of the building and the area.

Quickly transport to Carmen courtesy of a Warp spell from either Nina or Bleu.
Once there, exit the town and then transform into the large bird with Nina at
the front of the party. Now fly east just past Tock (so you can still see it in
your screen) and then turn directly south. Fly over some water and you will
come to the poisonous water with the broken bridge that you fished from for the
P.Fish. Now continue flying south a little ways and you will come to a large
tower surrounded by mountains and a wall. Land to the west and then enter the
area.

Items: Herb

Walk up to one of the three guards here and talk to him. Upon seeing the pass,
the middle of the guards will move back, allowing you to enter the area. Walk
to the center of the area and you will see an elevator, but try to activate it
with the switch to the left and you will find that the Parts are not in the
right place (it doesn't work). Now head down the steps below you and enter the
door on your right. Rest at the Inn here and grab the Herb in the chest of
drawers if you wish. Now exit and head over and into the room to the left of
the steps. Save at the Dragon Statue here and then exit, heading back up the
stairs. You can enter the rooms below and talk to the people but it's really
not important. Basically you learn that Zog is in the tower above and that he
forced people to work for him, but some mole people (like Mogu) dug a hole and
got away so now the Dark Dragons can't excavate the Obelisk now. Nothing big
unless you're really into the storyline, so just exit the area to the west.

the bed and he will tell you that he climbed the Scande tower and brought the
Parts home, and he will give them to you, though they are broken. Once you
receive the B.Part from the man, exit the house and continue east out of the
town.

Thee craftsmen...er oxen of Gant will surely be able to repair the broken parts
for you. Exit the Dragon Shrine and then make your way all the way north, up
three flights of stairs and into the large building up here. Once inside, take
the stairs to the right up a floor and then head over to the left and talk to
the old woman in pink. She will wake up the mayor, who will pop out of bed
abruptly with a yawn. Talk to him and you will give him the B.Part. After a
short pause, he will have the Parts for you, completely fixed. Now leave the
house and exit the town to the south.

the switch this time. The Parts will fit perfectly, so step on the elevator and
it will take you up quite a ways to another elevator shaft. Ride this one up as
well another long distance and you will arrive at some intricately designed
double doors. Press A to open them and then enter the tower.

SCANDE TOWER

In here, walk directly ahead and talk to the strange figure that you have
encountered a couple times before. He will ask if you are wondering why he is
here. He will then say that you can get to Zog if you wish, but he will tell
you of a weapon in Tunlan, called D.Hrt, which can destroy any dragon. You
might need this against Zog, so exit the tower and head back down the
elevators, continuing west out of the area.

Once here, exit the Dragon Shrine and then head up the broad stairs to the
right, continuing directly north into the doorway just ahead. Talk to the woman
in this household and she will say that she doesn't know of any legendary
weapon but she does know a Dragon song. After singing it, the screen flashes
and Ryu becomes disturbed. Evidently, the song is called the D.Hrt and she
gives it to you in a bottle. Well, since Ryu is a member of the Dragon clan, he
is hurt badly by the song, so rest at the Inn to the south, and then leave the
city.

SCANDE TOWER
Enemies: BowManX, Claw, Entity, LancerX, Soldier
Items: IcyCN, Mrbl1, Glove, PowerHT, Cure

The mysterious figure will be gone now, so you can pass on. Hey, guess what?
There are no random enemies in this tower. Thank God you get a break from that.
Anyways, head up to a split in the path and take the eastern path. Soon
afterward, you will encounter another fork, where you should continue on east,
following the path as it goes north up to a clean water spring and some
switches to the right. If you need a healing, take a sip from the spring and
then head up the stairs to the right. Ha, I was just kidding about the no
enemies thing. It turns out that there are enemies on this floor, and the new
ones have a lot of HP. Despite being hard to bring down, they aren't very tough
in general, so you shouldn't have too hard of a time. There are also some Dark
Dragon enemies here but they were never very hard, even in groups. Anyhow, make
your way west in this area and you will come to an open room to the north.
Enter it and take the IcyCN and Mrbl1 from the two chests and then make your
way back east and down the stairs you came up.

Now head back south as far as you can and then make your way west from there as
far as you can go. Make your way north from here, under an overpass to a large
raised platform. There is nothing on it, however, so head over to the left and
continue on north and up the stairs you come to. Head south to an area with
many columns and then back up through the opening to the right. Continue
northeast form there into a little cove with two chests and grab the Glove and
PowerHT in them. Now head back southwest to the opening into the large room
with the columns and head all the way south, past a red table, and up the
stairs at the end. Here, head north down a long hallway and up the stairs at
the end, and in the next room, head south, west and around to the north down
some more stairs. Grab the Cure from the chest in this area and then continue
up the stairs to the northeast. Head south to some more stairs and you will
come to a floor with a clean water spring. Get a good recovery from it and then
make your way all the way north, through many columns, to a large doorway.
Enter into Zog's lair, preparing for battle, and head north to encounter Zog
himself. He will be surprised to see you here and then go on about how it is
good to have power before entering battle with you, transforming as he does.

                           |   Boss Battle: ZOG   |
         o-----------------o----------------------o----------------o
         |   Zog is one of the tougher bosses in the game, mostly  |
         |   because he has a buttload of health and some pretty   |
         |   nasty attacks. He has two fire strike attacks, both   |
         |   of which hit all party members. The milder one only   |
         |   does about 30-40 damage to each party member, though  |
         |   it does over 100 damage to a fused Karn. His other    |
         |   fire attack does over 100 damage to all allies, a     |
         |   very devastating attack. Also, watch out for his      |
         |   thunder attack that does a whopping 130 damage to     |
         |   each party member. Zog also has a normal attack,      |
         |   inflicting only about 50 damage to a single ally, but |
         |   it is nothing to worry about. Zog has the capability  |
         |   of taking out your entire team, with the exception of |
         |   Karn[Puka] maybe (as he has close to 900 HP), so      |
         |   always keep everyone healthy or at least above 200    |
         |   HP.                                                   |

         |   During the first round of battle, have Ryu transform  |
         |   into Rudra, Karn[Puka] use the D.Hrt item, Nina use a |
         |   Cure on Ryu, and Bleu use her NovaX spell.            |
         |   Karn[Puka], the first to attack will use the D.Hrt,   |
         |   inflicting over 2200 damage to Zog (holy shit!) but   |
         |   also reducing Ryu's health to 1. Luckily, this is     |
         |   countered by a Cure item from Nina, so you've got     |
         |   your bases covered. With everyone still healthy, just |
         |   keep attacking with Ryu in his Rudra form, Karn       |
         |   normally, Bleu using her NovaX spell until she runs   |
         |   out of AP, and Nina should always be healing or       |
         |   fortifying. Since the D.Hrt took away about 3/4 of    |
         |   of his HP, Zog should be in his "grinning fearlessly" |
         |   stage quite soon, but he has just about as much HP to |
         |   go as when he had a health bar. Just continue         |
         |   attacking fiercely and staying healthy and he         |
         |   shouldn't take much out of you.                       |

       !   Sara, Ryu's sister will be standing in front of Ryu,       !

       !   so she can destroy them. Ryu gives them to her and she     !

       !   transforms into Jade! Sara will hand her the keys and Jade !
       !   will thank you for killing Zog and finding the keys for    !
       !   them. Jade will then reveal to Ryu that she has his sister !

Try to exit to the south, but as you know, thee is no exit here. Luckily a mole
person will pop out of a hole in the ground in the center of the room, telling
you to follow him out. Head down the hole into an underground-looking area
(though you're still fairly high up) and once in this maze of an area, head
north and then around and back south until you come to a mole person. Talk to
him and he will shush you so that you don't disturb the master digger as he
must concentrate. Apparently they're running away from the Dark Dragons. Just
then, the Great Digger spins rapidly and digs a hole into the ground and all of
the moles jump in. Follow them into the hole and you will be back in a lower
room of Scande.

Exit the room to the south and then head over to the left. Make your way up the

Now we're headed all the way back to Agua so have Nina or Bleu use the Warp
spell to Romero, the nearest city to the floating tower. Once there, recover at
the local Inn and then save at the Dragon Shrine before leaving the city. Now
with Bo, Karn[Doof], or Karn[Shin] at the front of the party, head northwest
through the trees and enter the floating tower area.

Head left over to the large tile and read the inscription on the Tablet to make
the steps lower down to you. Now head north into the tower, and once inside, go
straight ahead and up the stairs. Head forward and up some more stairs and then
up another set to the left on the next floor. Head back to the right and up
these stairs and in this next area, head southwest and ride the floating
platform here across just to the south. Now head south and out the exit here.
Walk on this outside ledge over to the right and enter the doorway there. Once
back inside, head over to the left and ascend the staircase here.

This is the room where you got the LifeAR and IcyDR from the two statues on
either side of the path, assuming you did the first side-quest. Simply just
head into the temple in front of you and you will find Sara standing in front
of you. Approach her and she will tell Ryu to stop Jade before she (Sara calls
Jade a "he" but I'm still going with a female, because Jade just seems like a
feminine name) succeeds. She then shares that she won't let herself interfere,
and then she leave up the stairs to the left. Follow Ryu's sister up the stairs
to the west and in this cosmic room, head up north to encounter Jade.

Enemies: Buzzer, Entity, Ghoul, ICU, Nautulis, PincherX, Widow, Zombie
Items: Domino, PowerAR, AgileAR, TrapGrd, FlameDR, StoneHT

The enemies in this new area are some of the same you have seen before with
some really weak Zombies thrown in there. The new ICU (clever name) and
PincherX are pretty hard to bring down but aren't hard in general, while the
Ghouls have a tendency to turn you into zombie's as well, so you will be using
Nina's Heal spell often. Once here, take stairs to your left and on the next
floor, head west and then south around the hole in the ground to a chest with a
Domino. Give this helmet to Nina and then head back north and east down the
stairs you came from. Back in the first room, head directly west to a wall of a
raised platform and then north up to a switch. Step on it to make some steps
appear in front of you and walk up them to the raised platform here. Continue
southwest and up the stairs here. In this area, make your way north, west, and
then south around the large gap in the floor to the chest and open it for some
PowerAR.

Give this armor to Bleu and then make your way back around, stepping on the
switch near the stairs to make the gate south of you lower. Now head down
through where the gate used to be and head down the stairs to the right to get
back to the original room. Now head over to the right and then up to another
switch, which you should step on to make more steps appear. Take them up to the
raised platform and then make your way back down south to a staircase. The two
holes in the floor here just lead back to the floor below, so ignore them and
make your way directly east across a long bridge to a room in the opposite
tower. On this new tiling, follow the path to a fork, and take the northern
path as it turns back west to a chest. Grab the AgileAR inside and equip it to
Bleu, then make your way back to the fork and continue on the southern path.
Follow it east and then around back to the west to some stairs, which you
should take down to the next room.

In this area, hit the leftmost switch of the two to make a couple gates ahead
of you lower and one to the northwest rise. Of the two paths north of you, take
the eastern one and follow it as it turns back south to the southeastern corner
of the area. Now head east a little to the wall and then make you way all the
way north, over a switch lowering a gate in front of you, to a chest containing
a TrapGrd. Now head back south, over the left switch to make the gates as they
need to be and then make your way west to the southwestern corner of the area.
Of the two paths that lie parallel in front of you, head up the right one and
follow it as it comes back south to more switches. This time, depress the right
one to lower the gate ahead of you, and then continue on north through another
gateway up to a chest. Grab the FlameDR inside and then proceed up the stairs
to the right. In the next room, follow the linear path as it goes around to
some more stairs.

In this new area, head down and then head up the stairs to the raised platform
in the center of the area. Now approach the stairs and your party will be
thrust back as Sara comes from the stairs ahead. Apparently a shield blocked
Ryu and company and you have received damage from it. Sara tells you that
you'll never be able to penetrate the shield and that you can only watch Jade
march to World Domination. She then relents and jumps into the shield to remove
it for you. Apparently she is slipping in and out of being controlled by Jade.
She gets up and allows you to head down the stairs, but your party has all been
reduced to 1 HP from hitting the shield so heal everyone with an M.Drop item or
any other means and then proceed to the stairs. Sara will tell you that she ahs
one last thing to say, so step back to her and she will tell you that she know
you will do whatever it takes to stop Jade, and then she starts to morph as she
enters battle with you.

                          |   Boss Battle: SARA   |
         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Sara in her large dragon form takes quite a while to  |
         |   bring down. I wonder if I didn't use the D.Hrt item   |
         |   on Zog (I didn't really need it), could I use it on   |
         |   Sara? No matter, Sara's attacks don't hit very hard,  |
         |   but with the length of the battle, they can start to  |
         |   get to you if you don't keep your health up. She uses |
         |   a normal fire breath attack that hits one ally for    |
         |   50-70 damage, though it does over 300 damage to Karn  |
         |   in his Puka form for some reason. She also uses a     |
         |   fairly weak T.Bolt strike that hits all allies for 55 |
         |   damage. It's nothing devastating to you a this point, |
         |   but again, it can wear on you after a while, so keep  |
         |   your health up.                                       |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Your offensive strategy against Sara should be pretty |
         |   much of the same. Ryu should attack every round as    |
         |   the Rudra dragon while Karn[Puka] attacks normally.   |
         |   When needed, Nina should do the healing routine, and  |
         |   attacking when not healing. Bleu should use her Comet |
         |   spell, hitting your dragon foe for a nice 600 damage  |
         |   each time, until her AP runs dry, following up with   |
         |   normal attacks when this happens. She has a lot of HP |
         |   but none past her health bar so just stay healthy and |
         |   keep up the onslaught to bring her down.              |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   8000 EP and 8000 GP acquired.                         |
         o---------------------------------------------------------o

After the battle ends in her defeat, Sara will rejoice, telling her brother
that she is finally free from Jade's control. She will then tell Ryu not to
grieve for her as he did the right thing before floating into the sky. Well
that was touching. Now make your way down the stairs just to the right of you.
Back in this area, make your way all the back west over another bridge to the
first tower and drink from the clean water spring there to recover you health
and AP. Now continue on west and then south down another staircase. On this
platform grab the StoneHT, which turns into a LoveHT I guess. Equip the LoveHT
on Nina and then proceed up the stairs to the right. In this next room, ignore
the hole south of you and step just to the right of it. Now head over to the
right on a path hidden by the wall and make your way around to the staircase.

Start by going west over the red circle to a split in the path. Head south and
follow this linear path as it heads east, north, back west, and then on a rapid
zig-zag down to a floating platform. Step on it and ride it across to the west.
Head south again from here and follow this linear path as is winds down, heads
back west, and then goes up north, past a floating platform to your left, to
some stairs. Head up these, and in the next room with the cosmic backdrop, ride
the platform ahead of you north to another ledge. Head directly north from here
and you will encounter Jade on a platform surrounded by bolts of lightning.

Well you near the conclusion to the game, it's time to obtain Ryu's final
dragon transformation spell as you will need it against the few final bosses of
the game. From Drogen, simply fly north, up past Camlon, and just a tiny bit to
the left until you reach a cave on an island in the middle of a lake. Land here
and enter the cave, which you visited once before to get the Cleansing Water.

Once inside, you may want to rearrange your party to your liking as Gobi and Bo
have been put in your front four. Afterward, head north past one path split and
then east at the next one you come to shortly afterward. Follow it as it turns
northbound and then back west to a staircase, which you should take down a
level. Now make your way north from the stairs and continue upward at the fork
you come to. Keep with the path as it goes east and around south, going down
the staircase at the end. Of the two paths to the left in the following area,
take the southern one to some more stairs downward. In the next water-filled
room, head directly south down some stairs and you will end up underwater.

Head down a couple more flights of stairs and then into the doorway at the
bottom of the temple to enter the inner shrine. Head north and up some stairs
onto a raised platform. Talk to the entity between the columns there and it
will tell you that you've learned Agni, but you need assistance in order to use
it. The picture of an awesome looking dragon (which kinda looks like a bird)
and then the spirit will disappear and Ryu will raise his sword in triumph as
lightning strikes him. Now leave the shrine via an Exit spell from Bleu.

Now put Nina back in front of the party and press A to transform into the large
bird. Fly south from the cave and a little east until you reach Camlon. Now fly
east to an island in the ocean with a single small house and many rocks

Go directly ahead and talk to the old woman standing outside the house. She
will tell you that collecting weapons is a hobby of hers and that she would
like to share her hobby, inquiring if you know any other weapon buffs. Now exit
the area and take flight with Nina again, flying directly south until you come
to another small house in the middle of some palm trees. Land there and enter
the house.

Head up and talk to the old man standing beside the goat outside the tent and
he will find that someone else who loves weapons like him is intriguing. He
asks you to take a List from his collection to her and then enters his tent.
Follow him inside and then push the furthest urn to the left backwards and take
the List from the chest to the right. Now exit the area and fly back north to
visit the old woman again.

Follow her inside and then head over to the right of the room and then back
left through the bed so that you are between the bed and the table. Push the
urn straight ahead of you upward and then push the urn on you left to the left.
Now grab the Wtzit from the chest and then exit the house and the area. Now fly

Wtzit. He will shortly depart into his tent to check out the mysterious weapon
and then come back outside to tell you that he doesn't think it is a weapon,
and that he must study it. He then gives you a letter with all the details to
bring back to the old woman. So exit the area and fly back up north and reenter

want it if it isn't a weapon and she gives you a letter to bring back to the

Talk to him once again and he will give you good news: the weapon is actually a
tool for the mole people called the I.Claw. You then hand him the letter from
the old woman and he gives you the I.Claw shortly afterward. Now talk to the
goat just for kicks and then leave the area.

here. Exit the Dragon Shrine room and then head up and enter the room north of
it. Switch Mogu to the front of the party and then talk to the mole person (the
Great Digger) here. He will praise you for finding the I.Claw and he will show
Mogu how to use it. After spinning around rapidly (reminds me of Taz the
Tasmanian devil, you know, from Looney Tunes), Mogu will try it. With the Great
Digger's approbation, Mogu will learn how to learn the I.Claw, but he reminds
you that it is old and can only be used once. Now exit the room and proceed
south and west and up the stairs to get back above ground.

Now, I recommend finishing up any side-quests that you did not complete before
making for the final dungeon in the game. When you're ready, have Nina
transform into the large bird and fly directly south from Gramor quite a long
ways until you reach the large poisonous lake. You should notice a floating
fortress in the middle of the lake where the tower Scande once stood. Fly into
the area.

Enemies: BlazeX, Claw, D.Knight, Gargoyle, Golem, ICU, PincherX, Ruga, Warlock
Items: FlameHR, EmporSD, StarHR

Nina will fly up here to a closed doorway and then land. If you try to open
them with Nina, she will just take flight again and leave the area, so just
switch Mogu to the from of the team and press A to open the doors. Enter them
and, in the following room, proceed directly ahead and stand on the cracked
area. With Mogu still at the lead of the party, press A to drill a hole down
into the actual Obelisk. Now, make your party as you wish once again for this
new area. The enemies here are much of what you've seen before. Be extra
careful of the BlazeX and ICU enemies, however, as they can cast attack spells
that do much damage to all allies. They don't even give good EP when you beat
them. Anyways, always stay healthy here and if you need more supplies or
whatnot, use the teleportation circle that you landed on to get out quickly.
Now on to the walkthrough...

Of the two paths that lie before you upon entering this area, head east to a
split, where you should head down the southern path and follow it as it comes
up north to a floating platform. Ride it across a large, empty, gap to another
path, and take this one north to a fork. Both paths lead to the same route so
take either one west to another floating platform, which you should ride
further west to an island ledge. Head down the stairs here, and in the
following area, head north up to another floating platform. Ride this up to
more ledges, and once there, head east and north to a path split with four
paths before you. For now, take the northern path and keep on it as it goes
northeast to a platform. Ride this east and then continue on east and south to
another platform, which will take you south. You will see Goda to your left
here, but you can't reach him from here, so just head south and a little west
to a chest.

Grab the FlameHR and then continue on west, riding another platform across that
direction. Head back west to the stairs you came down earlier and continue on
north, riding the platform at the end of the path again. Now head east and
north back up to the path split you were at once before. This time, head down
the southern path just to the right, and take it south and east to a floating
platform. Ride this to the south and on the next ledge you come to, head west,
south, and then back east to another platform, which you should take to the
east. Continue on east and north up to where Goda stands and he will tell you
that he will not let you interfere with emperor Jade, and that he'll stop you
when you try. After he storms off to the left, follow him and ride the platform
there to another island ledge, heading down the stairs on it.

Now make your way north across a cosmic abyss via floating platform and you
will come to a yellow-walled area. Before moving on, make sure you are healed
up and your party is how you like it for an upcoming boss battle. If you want
to use Agni, Karn cannot be fused, so if you have Karn fused as Puka or any
other form in your main party, revert him back to normal before moving on. When
you're ready, head north and a voice will give you a warning. Just then, Goda
will pop out of the wall ahead of you, telling you that your journey has come
to an end as he enters battle with you.

         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Goda isn't all that hard, even though he is one of    |
         |   final bosses in the game. This stone warrior has a    |
         |   single attack in which he forms a ball of blocks from |
         |   his torso and launches it at a single party member,   |
         |   inflicting anywhere from 50-80 damage upon him/her,   |
         |   though it only does about 20-30 damage to Ryu in Agni |
         |   form. Keep in mind that he becomes slightly more      |
         |   powerful once you deplete his visible health bar,     |
         |   though it really isn't anything to be worried of.     |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Well, when you use the Agni spell, there isn't much   |
         |   strategy involved. Simply have Ryu cast it the first  |
         |   round and then attack with it each round afterwards   |
         |   to hit Goda for 999 damage each round. Though         |
         |   transforming into Agni greatly increases Ryu's        |
         |   defense, have Nina cast FortX the first round to add  |
         |   a little extra boost. Just keep up the strong attack  |
         |   each round and use a Cure or any other health         |
         |   recovery item if your health reaches around 50 or so  |
         |   (though it shouldn't). Goda may have even more HP     |
         |   without a health bar than with one so don't let up    |
         |   until he is defeated.                                 |

         o---------------------------------------------------------o

After Goda is defeated and the battle ends, he will be astonished that you beat
him and then explode. Now refuse Karn if you wish and then proceed through the
hole that Goda left in the wall, and on the other side, head down the
staircase. Each of the four floating platforms here lead to staircases that all
lead to the same room. Even though the four staircases are far apart from each
other, they lead all end up at he same area in the room below, so take your
pick to get down there. The new Gargoyle and Golem enemies here aren't much of
a challenge and they don't reward you with much EP, so I just ignore them.
Anyhow, ride the platform just to the southeast across to a platform with a
large grey heart sort of like the one in the Stone Robot a while back. Head
south from here down some steps and then head up so more just northeast of you.

Up here, head north and a little east, riding the platform here further east.
Make your way west and south on this ledge and down some stairs. Head up
another flight just to the southeast to another large grey heart area and ride
the floating platform here to the south. Head down the stairs to the south on
this third grey heart platform and make your way west and north up some more
stairs to a raised area. Take the party south up here and then east, riding the
floating platform across to another raised area. Proceed east and north, and
then south down a flight of stairs. On lower ground again, make your way up the
stairs to the southwest to another heart area, and head east and north from
there to a staircase heading down, which you should take. In the next room,
ride the floating platform west of you further to the west and then head down
the stairs on this island to get to Jade's lair.

Before proceeding, revert Karn back to normal if you fused him again, and heal
up you party to prepare for battle. Now proceed straight ahead and present
yourself before the evil emperor. He will congratulate you for keeping up with
him in spite of the odds and then he will offer you to join him. Say "No" and
she will battle you, but you may want to check the Secrets section under the
"Tips & Tricks" chapter for a way to battle some enemies including one that
will give you 9999 EP and 9999 GP (though you don't really need money now)
before fighting Jade. Whichever way you choose, you inevitably must enter
battle with him as he transforms.

                          |   Boss Battle: JADE   |
         o----------------o-----------------------o----------------o
         |   Wow, Jade is one ugly bug, but luckily, it isn't very |
         |   tough, though it can take down Agni in one hit.       |
         |   Jade's normal attacks consist of it launching a white |
         |   orb at a single party member doing around 70-100      |
         |   damage. It also can launch some small spores into the |
         |   air that lands on your party doing around 30-50       |
         |   damage to each party member. Keep in mind, however,   |
         |   when in Agni form, these attacks only doing around    |
         |   15-35 damage. Occasionally, however, Jade will use a  |
         |   strong T.Bolt strike that does a significant amount   |
         |   of damage, and a weaker Blizzard attack. What you     |
         |   must beware of is the Shock attack, which is an       |
         |   instant kill to one party member, but has only about  |
         |   a 50% chance of hitting. Jade will only use this      |
         |   once or twice during the battle and it is used, pray  |
         |   that it doesn't take Agni down, because you can't     |
         |   afford to cast it again.                              |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   To effectively defeat Jade, you're going to have to   |
         |   use Ryu's Agni transformation. Hopefully you still    |
         |   have some Acorns or other AP recovery items because   |
         |   you're going to need it once more and there is        |
         |   nowhere else to heal. But back to the strategy, just  |
         |   attack each round, hitting Jade for 999 damage, as    |
         |   that is all you really can do. Once your HP gets down |
         |   to around 200, use a Cure or any other healing item   |
         |   to keep you in the fight. After Jade starts to grin   |
         |   fearlessly, it doesn't have very much health left, so |
         |   continue to pound it with the strong attacks for a    |
         |   few more rounds and you should have the victory.      |

Once he is defeated, Jade will laugh and ask if you are happy now that you've
beaten him. He goes on to tell you to now let it get to your head, as you
didn't really defeat him. He continues saying that it was his destiny to lose,
which he realized when he released the goddess. He then explodes as he tells
you to enjoy meeting Tyr, the goddess of destruction. Before stepping on the
gray circles in front of your party, make your way directly forward, to the
left side of the throne, facing the wall, and press A to find the EmporSD,
Ryu's most powerful weapon. Now search the back of the eastern column in this
room to find a StarHR, Ox's most powerful weapon. Give the sword to Ryu and the
hammer Ox and then step on either of the grey tiles on the floor below the
throne to activate a lift. A floating platform will drop down soon after you
stop so ride it across to the north, and on this ledge, head just up north to
girl standing in the middle of the pathway.

This is the goddess Tyr, so talk to her and she will ask if you came here to
have a wish granted. Say yes and she will heal your wounds for you (goddess of
destruction my ass), so forget everything I said about needing Acorns to
replenish Ryu's AP. Now when she if you have a wish again, say "No" and she
will notice that your sword is out (hehe), proceeding to battle you. She will
not attack you at all at first, and there are a couple outcomes you could have
in this battle. If you do not use Agni and wear her down with whatever else,
when her health gets to about 1/3, she will stop the battle and tell you to
stop hurting her as she hasn't done anything. Talk to her again and she will
ask if you want to be friends. Say yes and an apparition of Sara will appear in
front of you, telling you to use the magic of Agni to reveal the girl's true
self. The Goddess will get mad and enter battle with you again, this time, a
little deranged. Continue to not use Agni and you will get the "bad" ending.
Use Agni at any time during the battles, the fray will stop for a moment when
she will transform into her true self, which looks like it would be out of the
movie Alien. Defeat this for the "good" ending. Here are strategies and endings
for both scenarios:

ENDING #1 - "BAD" ENDING

                 o-----------------------------------------o
                 |   Boss Battle: GODDESS[DERANGED GIRL]   |
         o-------o-----------------------------------------o-------o
         |   Well, this battle is quite hard, due to the immense   |
         |   amount of health that this little crazy girl has. Her |
         |   attacks are strong as hell to, as her normal attack,  |
         |   which consists of her launching a white orb at you,   |
         |   can do anywhere from 80 to over 100 damage to one     |
         |   ally. She also casts a Blizzard spell that does 100   |
         |   damage to each party member. These strong attacks     |
         |   make the battle against the goddess hard to outlast.  |
         |   Make sure that Nina keeps everyone as healthy as she  |
         |   can, and you may even need others to help out with    |
         |   Cure or M.Drop items to stay alive.                   |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Without being able to use the Agni transformation     |
         |   spell, you will want to attack at least in his Rudra  |
         |   dragon form, which, though less than half as powerful |
         |   as Agni, is the next best thing. If Karn is not fused |
         |   anymore, you may want to take the first round to fuse |
         |   him again into the Puka form and then attack normally |
         |   each round afterward Have Nina cast FortX while       |
         |   everyone is still healthy and then heal just about    |
         |   every round afterward. Bleu should cast Comet each    |
         |   round until she runs out of AP, wherein she with      |
         |   normal attacks. This will be a long, grueling, and    |
         |   tough battle, and if you can manage to stay healthy   |
         |   throughout, you will defeat the Goddess.              |

         o-----------o---------------------------------o-----------o
         |   The goddess Tyr in this alien form surprisingly is    |
         |   not as difficult to defeat as in the deranged girl    |
         |   form, mostly because it doesn't have as much HP and   |
         |   because you can use Agni now. Goddess has a couple    |
         |   projectile attacks, one of which consists of small    |
         |   white orbs launched at one party member, inflicting   |
         |   around 110-140 damage. The second is a black          |
         |   projectile that does a little more damage, also to a  |
         |   single ally. Goddess can also cast a Comet-like       |
         |   BigCrash spell that does 70 damage to each party      |
         |   member. Though these attacks are stronger than the    |
         |   goddess in her girl form, keep in mind that they are  |
         |   only about 40-50% effective against Agni.             |
         |          .-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.-'-.          |
         |   Your strategy against this monster is very simple:    |
         |   have Ryu fuse with all party members to form the      |
         |   ultimate Agni dragon and then attack round after      |
         |   round to inflict 999 damage upon the Goddess with     |
         |   each attack. The alien's health level may be a bit    |
         |   deceiving as it only takes two Agni strikes to        |
         |   deplete his visible health bar but the battle will    |
         |   continue another 15-20 rounds until the Goddess is    |
         |   truly defeated. Your HP will get low throughout the   |
         |   battle so when you get to around 150 HP, make sure to |
         |   use a Melon item to fully replenish your health       |
         |   completely and then return to the attacking. This     |
         |   final fight is not difficult at all as long as you    |
         |   heal accordingly and outlast the fiend.               |

You can only accomplish this side-quest once Karn is a member of your party.
With his lock-picking skills, you can revisit some areas that had locked doors
leading to other areas and ultimately, other chests. Wherever you are on the
World Map, have Nina use her Warp spell to warp back to the kingdom of Winlan.

Items: FlameRP, Turban, BrokenSD, Life, Life2, Cure

Exit the Dragon Shrine here and head all the way north up various flights of
stairs and enter the castle. Head to the northeast corner of the area and go
down the stairs here. Now head left out of the little room with the staircase
and head south to a wall, not into the doorway. Head east from there into the
small hallway that leads to the bridge. But instead of going further east to
the bridge, unlock the gates just to the right of the guards with Karn. In the
six chests here, grab the FlameRP, Turban, BrokenSD, Life, life2, and Cure.
Give the FlameRP to Nina and the BrokenSD to Ryu. Now head back up the stairs
to the northwest, exit the castle, and leave the kingdom after saving at the
Dragon Shrine.

Your next stop on this short side-quest is Aqua, the floating tower. Use Nina
to Warp to Romero. Exit the Dragon Shrine here and then exit the town. Switch
Bo to the head of your party and make your way around the city and northwest
through the forest and enter the bridge leading to the tower.

Enemies: G.Knight, S.Rider, WarHog, Zombie
Items: LavaSH, LifeAR, IcyDR

Walk to the end of the stone bridge here and read the inscription on the Tablet
to make the tower lower to you. Once it does, enter it and switch back to Karn
as the leader of the team. In this first room, go straight ahead and up the
stairs here. Use Karn to unlock the door ahead and proceed up the stairs just
behind it. Now unlock the door to your left and continue left and up the
staircase. Do the opposite in this room: unlock the door to the right and
continue on to the staircase. Now in this room, head west and south to another
locked door and open it with Karn. Ride the floating platform just behind it to
another ledge, and then head south from here out to a green ledge just outside
the tower.

Follow it around to another doorway inside and take the LavaSH in the chest
here. It is a great shield that adds greatly to your defense so equip it to
either Ryu or Karn. Now head over to the left of the chest and up the staircase
here. In this water-filled room, walk up until you see a statue of a dragon on
either side of you. Stand in front of each statue and examine them for some
LifeAR and an IcyDR. You obviously were not supposed to get these two items so
early in the game as they are some of the best items in the game. Equip the
armor to Ryu and the dagger to Karn and then head back down the stairs. Now
ride the platform here across to the original ledge that you were on and make
your way down the stairs. Continue on down the nearby stairs until you are out
of the tower.

Once you have Ox in your party, you can complete this small side-quest by
making use of his ability to break down weak walls and destroy rocks. Like the
first side-quest, this is an optional adventure to gain some new items that
were previously unattainable from dungeons that you had visited.

From the world map, use Nina to Warp your team to Romero. Exit the town and
place Bo at the lead of your party. Now head northwest through the woods and
enter the floating structure that is Agua.

Enemies: G.Knight, S.Rider, WarHog, Zombie
Items: Life, 3000GP, Life2, SilverBR

Head west along the stone bridge and read the inscription on the Tablet to make
the floating tower come down to you. Head north into the tower, and once
inside, head directly ahead up a staircase. In this room, ride the floating
platform to the south over the gap here. Now head east and north up a hallway
to a breakable wall, which you should take down with Ox. Now grab the Life,
3000GP, Life2, and SilverBR from the four chests in this little area. Now head
back south and ride the platform back across the gap, taking the stairs down.
Now make your way south out of the tower and then head back east across the
stone bridge back out to the World Map.

Simply use Nina's Warp spell to transport to Auria. Head out of the Dragon
Shrine here and southwest out of the city. Now head east and into the L & D
Cave here.

Enemies: Bully, Fly, Midget
Items: L.Ptn, A.Ptn

In here, head north and east down the stairs here. Now make your way south
through a doorway and follow the path around to the north and up a stairway.
Now head east from here until the path splits, and take the northern way.
Follow this linear path around to the east, past a doorway to a breakable wall.
Use Ox to destroy it and take the L.Ptn and the A.Ptn from the chests behind
it. Now continue on the path heading west and follow it around to a ground
switch. Step on it to make the gate lower, then head all the way south out of
the cave.

                           \=====================/

As soon as you acquire the Rod5 from Tunlan (you must have acquired the Sphere
for Gobi to become a big fish), you can go and fish for the first of some great
equipment. To start off, if you haven't fished in the game before (I don't
blame you, it's pretty worthless), then, from the World Map, use Nina or Bleu
to warp you to Auria.

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=

                                =-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once in the city, exit the Dragon Shrine and head over to the second door to
the left, where the Weapons and Items Shops are. Purchase about 9 or so Worms,
and then exit the city. Back out on the World Map, Warp the party to Tantar.
Now exit that town.

Items: Slab

From outside Tantar, head north a step to a bank of the river, then make your
way directly west from there until you are near the ocean. Now head north
through a little strip of land between the water and a cliff. Follow this
little path northwest to a stone well. Equip the Rod5 and the Worms in Ryu's
two ETC slots and then press A to fish in the well and catch the Slab. If you
do not get it on your first try, keep fishing - it shouldn't take you long to
catch it. Once you retrieve it, look it up in your Vital (VITL) items area. It
says that ultimate power sleeps where mystic water lies. This isn't really
important in your quest but it is referring to Agni, the ultimate dragon
transformation. Well this side-quest is finished.

Time to go fishing again. Hopefully you still have some bait, but if you don't,
just head back to Auria for some more. Once you're ready, have Nina or Bleu
Warp your party to Romero and exit the town.

Items: DragonSD

From the town, place Bo or Karn[Shin] at the lead of your party and head
directly west through the trees to a small strip of mountain. Now take your
party north, west, and south around the mountains and once you reach a solitary
tree, make your way west a short ways to an old stone well. Switch Ryu to the
front of the party and equip the Rod5 and Worms in his two ETC slots. Now face
the well and press A to fish to catch the DragonSD. If you do not get it on
your first try, keep fishing - it shouldn't take you long to catch it. Once you
have it, equip it for a hefty boost in ATTACK and reequip whatever else you had
in the ETC slots. This simple side-quest is now complete!

Ready for some more fishing for powerful equipment? Well grab your fishing pole
(Rod5) and use Nina's Warp spell to quickly transport your party to Arad. Now
exit the small camp to get out into the desert.

Items: DragonHT

As soon as you are outside, take about ten steps to the west and then proceed
south to some mountains. Now continue with your party west, following the
mountain range to the ocean. Once there, you should notice a little opening to
the south between the mountains and the water. Head down into this little
alcove and you will find another old, stone well here. Do the routine with
equipping the Rod5 and Worms on Ryu and fish in the well for the DragonHT. Once
you obtain it, equip this strong helm on Ryu and this small side-quest is done.

                     \=================================/

Well, once you receive your eight and final party member, Mogu, you can use his
special ability to Dig to secret chambers where treasures lie. Remember those
dirt patches with those funny symbols on the ground? Well if you don't, you
will when you see one again. They represent where hidden treasures lie. To find
the first, use Nina or Bleu to Warp the party to Camlon and exit the city once
you get there.

From the large city, follow the path northwest and then back east across a
stone bridge. Make your way up the ramp here and then go east across another
stone bridge. When you reach the mountains, head north a little to the first
dirt patch (remember now?) and put Mogu at the lead of the team. Press A to dig
down into a Hidden Room.

In this area, head all the way to the left and north up the platform where a
man is standing. Place Karn at the front of the party and talk to the man. He
will notice you and teach you a new transformation spell, Doof, as you a member
of his family line. Now that you have this spell, which fuses Karn with Bo and
Ox to make a huge pig-like creature, leave the area on the transportation
circle to the northeast back out to the World Map.

For the second dirt patch, have Nina or Bleu Warp the party to Tantar, exiting
the city once you arrive. From outside the city, head north and then east
across the stone bridge you come to. Continue north up the dirt ramp and then
follow the dirt path northeast until come to a large ramp. Do not head up it,
however. Instead, head to the right of the cliff and then make your way north
to another dirt patch. Switch Mogu to the lead if the party and press A to Dig
open a hole to another Hidden Room.

Items: L.Ptn, Clog, V.Ptn, A.Ptn

There are four chests in this room, one in each of the four corners of the
room. Grab the L.Ptn, Clog (this chest causes your lead party member to
collapse), V.Ptn (this chest completely recovers your lead party member's HP
and AP), and A.Ptn. Deal the enhancements out as you like and then exit using
the blue teleportation circle in the center of the room.

Now Warp the party to Carmen, courtesy of Nina or Bleu and then exit the town
once you arrive. Make your way south from the town and then east around the
trees here. When you reach a dead tree near a ramp heading south, continue on
northeast past a couple more dead trees, and after the second, continue east
past a couple ramps heading north and south. Now take your party north to a
dirt area. Just northwest of here is another dirt patch. Switch Mogu to the
front of the party and press A while standing over the dirt patch to dig down
into a Hidden Room.

Items: HeroBW

In here, head up the raised platform to the left and open the chest to obtain
the HeroBW. Equip this weapon to Bo and then heal whoever was poisoned by the
Toxin trap on the chest. Now make your way up the raised platform to the right
and step on the blue circle there to be transported back up to the surface.

Now, once Nina has gotten the ability to transform into a bird and fly around
the World Map, you can find the fourth dirt patch. Have either Nina or Bleu
Warp the party to Winlan, and once there, exit the city. Switch Nina to the
front of the party and press A to become a large bird. Now, from outside
Winlan, fly north a little ways until you reach the island with a dirt patch on
it. Land there and switch Mogu to the front of the party, pressing A while
standing on the dirt patch to dig underground.

Items: V.Ptn, S.Ptn, Sash

In here, take the V.Ptn from the chest in front of you, and then switch Ox to
the front of the party to knock down the two weak walls on either side of the
room. Grab the S.Ptn and Sash from the two chests in the rooms that lay beyond
the broken walls and then heal from the chest traps at the clean water in the
center of the room, unless you removed them with Karn. Reconfigure your party
as you wish and deal out the enhancements as you see fit, and then step on the
blue circle to get teleported out of the room.

To access the final dirt patch, have Nina or Bleu Warp the party quickly back

to become the large bird. Fly directly east, past Tock, until you reach some
water. Once you do, fly directly south for some time and you will see the final
dirt patch. Land on this peninsula and switch Mogu to the front of the party,
pressing A while standing on the dirt patch to dig down underneath.

Items: LoveHT, StarSH, MystCW, S.Ptn, A.Ptn, L.Ptn, Life2, AgileHT

Well, there are eight items in here, and all are good. Starting from the bottom
center and working around clockwise, grab the LoveHT, StarSH, MystCW, S.Ptn,
A.Ptn, L.Ptn, Life2, and AgileHT. Give Nina the AgileHT or the LoveHT, Karn the
StarSH, Mogu the MystCW (which allows him to hold a shield now), and then dole
out the enhancing potions as you see fit. Once you are ready, step on the
teleportation circle in the center of the room to get back to the surface, and
this long side-quest is finally finished.

As soon as you get the final transformation spell for Karn, Puka, you can use
its special ability to open the stone doors in the sides of cliffs that have
the weird emblem on them. To access the first one, use either Bleu or Nina to
Warp the party to Auria, and once there, exit the city.

Make your way directly north of the city and you will come to the first of
these stone walls. With Karn[Puka] at the lead of your party, press A while
facing the wall and it will slide over, revealing a cave entrance, which you
should enter.

Items: DarkBR

In this room, make your way north to a solitary chest on a raised platform.
Grab the DarkBR, equip this ETC item on Karn, and then exit the hidden cave.

Now Warp the party to Gust, courtesy of Nina or Bleu. Once there, exit the town
to the south and then make your way southwest down a dirt ramp. Continue south
across the stone bridge to the left, and from there, head west all the wall to
the beach where another sealed stone wall is. With Karn[Puka] at the lead of
the party, press A in front of the stone door to make it slide over. Enter the
entrance it reveals.

taken), and then exit back outside.

the town and then east around the trees here. When you reach a dead tree near a
ramp heading south, continue on northeast past a couple more dead trees, and
just after the second, take the ramp heading down south. Now make your way just
northeast to where the final sealed stone door is. With Karn[Puka] at the lead

You can obtain this third piece of Dragon equipment after defeating Mote in the
Mare Tower and using the SkyKey in Spyre to warm up the climate of the area.
Wherever you are on the World Map, have Nina or Bleu use the Warp spell to
quickly get to Spring.

Items: DragonAR

In the town, cross the bridge to the west and then head northwest up to near
the Items Shop. Head down the steps to the left of the shop to get down into
the river, and make your way just north from there to some more steps to the
left. Go up these and continue west onto a dock in a small pond with three
ducks swimming back and forth. Approach the edge of the dock and equip Ryu with
the Rod5 and some bait, pressing A to fish after you do. Once you catch the
DragonAR, it is up to you whether you want to equip it to Ryu. The LifeAR from
the "Unlocking Doors" side-quest has a higher armor rating by 5 points but it
weighs 8 points more. I personally would go with the DragonAR, as the extra 8
ACTIVE points will benefit you more than 5 DEFENSE points. Well, once you're
done deciding, this short side-quest is finished.

                         /==========================\

Once you have Nina's ability to transform into a bird and fly wherever you want
on the World Map, you can acquire this final piece of Dragon equipment. For the
quickest way to get there, have Nina or Bleu Warp your party to Tunlan, and
once there, exit the city.

Items: DragonSH

Out here, switch Nina to the front of the party and press A to transform into a
large bird. Now fly directly north from outside Tunlan. Shortly after you come
to some more land, you should reach some mountains. Fly just east from there
and land in the middle of the mountains, where an old well is. Switch Ryu back
to the lead of the party, equipped with the Rod5 and some bait, and press A to
fish out the DragonSH. Give this freaking strong shield to Ryu as well as any
ETC items you previously had on him, and this side-quest is over.

                         \==========================/

o Save often and rest at Inns whenever you can to stay healthy.

o Stock up on healing and curing supplies at Item Shops. Earlier in he game,
  you will need a lot of Herbs, so keep them handy.

o If a party member has low health and you cannot heal him/her quickly, switch
  him/her to the back row to enhance his/her defense until you can get to an
  Inn or some means of healing.

o Always enter a boss battle with full health. It can be a pain to start off
  with low HP and have to use the first couple rounds to heal.

o Perform the side-quests as soon as you can to get some of the best equipment
  in the game quickly and fairly easily so that you won't need to upgrade your
  armaments for a long time.

o Don't suck - like Dan.

                              AVOID FIGHTING POG
                          =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In the Dark D. Fort, when the imposter chief tries to lead you to the guard's
weapons, continue to tell him "No" and eventually Bo will appear, skipping the
whole Pog sequence. If you choose to do this, however, the battle against the
General will be harder.

                            =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

In Bleak, visit the boy who thinks he is a magician. Talk to him and he'll tell
you to put 100 coins on the table and he will make them disappear. Agree to his
trick and when he tells you to look behind you, tell him "No" twice and then
"Yes." You should see Chun Li practicing her lightning kick.

                              ENTERTAINING JADE
                          =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

When you encounter Jade in the Obelisk, right before you are about to fight
him, he will ask if you want to join him. Say "Yes" and he will say that you
know what is best for you. Don't press a button and after a pause he will say
that you are boring and send a D.Flea to fight you as entertainment. Defeat it
and Jade will then send out a Crab to attack you. Defeat it, and the Flower and
G.Slime that he sends afterward. He will then send a large M.Slime against you.
Defeat it and it will reward you with 9999 EP and 9999 GP. Note that if you
press a button in the pauses between battles, Jade will ask if you've changed
your mind. Say "Yes" and you will battle him; say "No" and he will continue the
charades, sending out a Buzzer, then a Crawler, and finally a red Ruga, which
also gives a fairly good amount of EP, before restarting with a D.Flea. You can
do this as many times as you want to level up before fighting Jade.

GameFAQs

Thanks to CJayC and all who have contributed to GameFAQs. This is an awesome
sight providing free gaming help to anyone and everyone and has inspired me to
write FAQs.

=-=-=-
Capcom

The creators of this game deserve most of the credit for creating an amazing
RPG experience for the dragon-lover inside us all.

=-=-=-=-
Nintendo
=-=-=-=-

These guys deserve much credit as well for creating both the GameBoy Advance as
well as the earlier Super Nintendo gaming systems. Heck, without these, how
would we play this awesome game?

The Game Manual
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Some of the information in this FAQ came directly from the game manual, so I
have to give it, and its creators, much credit for the information. It helped
greatly.

Lastly, I guess I can give credit to myself as I put a lot of time and effort
into making this FAQ for the benefit of others. I hope some people find this
Walkthrough useful.

Thanks for allowing me to use the information from your Monster List FAQ in my

Thanks for informing me on what the controls are for the Super Nintendo version
so that I can place this walkthrough on the SNES page as well.
