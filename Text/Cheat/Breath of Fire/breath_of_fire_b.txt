The chest in the upper left corner of the room has a DreamRG with a 
Fire trap. Two platforms down is a Life with a Toxin trap. Two chests 
over is a Herb with a Fire trap. On the platform next to the stairway 
from 1F is a Herb, protected by a Toxin trap. Two platfroms over is an
IronSH, guarded with a Curse trap. Two platforms down is a Dagger, but
you'll have to spring a DarkMist trap on yourself. Here are the trap
floors, at least that I know of:
1. Northeast of the platform with Life.
2. Sotheast of a platform in the lower part of a room, that has a
Herb.
3. Sotheast of a platform in the northern part of the room, which
which also has a Herb.

room are the only ones in the Krypt that are safe to open without 
having Karn in your party. At any rate, Karn shows up, and offers to
help. He leaves. Follow him down the stairs.
B5 - Karn joins you. Immediately place Karn at the front of your party.
because he can open chests with springing traps, and can open locked
doors. Go right, up through 2 locked doors. left, down, left, up. Now

if you need them. You start in the upper-right corner. The exit to 3F is
in the center of the lower part of the room.

stairs.
6F (Stars) - Start in the lower-left. Go to the upper-right to find the
Machine and the SkyKey, but also a surprise. Mote will appear, and send
you into his dream.

*Mote's Village
Nothing special. Just exit the town, and walk south, onto the ledges,
and walk northeast. Then walk north, then west, and south to the cave.
Go through here to find the entrance to Mote's Tower.

*Mote's Tower
ITEMS: Cure, L-Ptn, JadeBW, Trident, Smoke, CursedHT, FaceMask
PARTY: Mogu, Ryu, Nina, Bleu
BOSS: Mote
LEVEL: 30

B2 - Go left, then up, and right. Take the first path down, and find a
Cure, L-Ptn, JadeBW, and Trident. Collect these. When you open the
chests, a gat closes behind you, so search the room for a gate. In the
next room, go up the stairs along the right wall. Now go right, down,
and left to another stairway. Climb it to return to B1. Go left, up, and
right. Go down the stairs again. Now go back up and go all the way right
this time. You'll find another stairway.
B1 - Collect the CursedHT, FaceMask, and Smoke. Now go left, and up all
the way to find Mote's Conscionce. Now go up and climb the stairs.
1F - Drink the Health Spring to recover HP & AP. Check the pot to find

Poison Field, so be prepared. Well, this is what you do, I hope!

walk down 4 steps, left 6, down 1, left 1, down 2, and up the stairs.
Take the lower-right stairway in the next room. Now fight Mote. You'll

*Spyre Tower
ITEM: SkyKey
Collect the Sky Key, and then cast Exit to quickly leave the tower. If
you don't have enough AP to cast the spell, and don't have any
AP-recovery items, there are places (on Snow and Rain floors) where you

------------------------------------------------------------------------
		PART 9: RESTORING TIME TO NORMAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Rod5 and a fishing bait, fish off the dock in the northwest corner

secret cave. Go through the cave to find a passage to a new area. Then
walk south to find the town of Carmen.

*Carmen
ITEMS: RubyBR, W-Ant
In the dresser at the Inn is a RubyBR. Go to the second floor of the
house above the Weapon Shop, then push a barrel left and check the
ground to find a W-Ant. You can't use the Inn or Weapon Shop until
you've got the Time Key. Time is stopped in this town, so you can't talk
to anybody in town, except Alan (the one person who does move). 
Well, go south, then east, then north, then west to a tower surrounded
by forests. Have Bo lead the party, and you can enter. But, there is
also some stuff to do first. Walk to the dry field farther east. You'll
find a Dragon Emblem on the ground. Have Mogu dig in this spot to find
the HeroBW for Bo. This is a VERY powerful weapon. Also, with Karn's
Puka spell, you can stand next to the Dragon Seal on the cliff, and
press A to open it. Inside is a WindBR. Now return to the previously
mentioned tower, and enter.

*Tock
ITEMS: Life, EvilCN, Cure, G-Tiara, GuardSH, Life2, WolfSkin, AgileHT
PARTY: Bo, Ryu, Nina, Bleu
LEVEL: 31
Go up, and drink from the Health Spring. Go left, and down to a Left
Arrow Tile. Step on it to go through the left wall. Now go up and follow
the path. You'll find a Life, and an EvilCN. Find another Left Arrow
Tile. Go through the left wall again. Now go up, left, dwon, and step on
another tile. Go up the stairs.
2F - Go up/left to find a Cure. Go to the right to a Right Arrow. Step
on it. Walk down to the Right Arrow. Step on it. Now go to the upper
right to find a Right Arrow. Go Up Arrow. Follow the outer wall, until
you reach a Left Arrow in the lower-right corner of the room. In the
lower-right area of this floor, you'll find a stairway up. Go up it.
3F - Collect the G-Tiara. Take the Down Arrow. Go left and up and step
on the Left Arrow. Get the GuardSH. Step on Right Arrow. Go along the
left edge of the platform to find a Life2. Go on top of the platform to

Take the Left Arrow (one step right and up step up from the chest), then
turn around and use the Right Arrow. Walk up to the Up Arrow. Take the
stairs up. Also, the first chest in this room has an AgileHT.
5F - Go up, and talk to Cerl. Ryu will be sepperated from the party.
Equip him with a DreamRG to block sleep (Paralyze) condition. Use Cure
to recover HP when needed. If you have many to waste, you can build up
Ryu's Level quickly. Well, go east along the path, then up, and take the
west turn all the way, then up to Carmen.

*Carmen
Your party rejoins you, and Alan tells you Cerl isn't really bad, just
under control of the Dark Dragons. He goes to stop her.

*Tock
PARTY: Ryu, Nina, Bo, Bleu
BOSS: Cerl
LEVEL: 32
Go back to the top of the tower. This time, Alan will talk to Cerl
about her childhood, then Cerl will attack. Fight her, and then she'll
use the TmKey to send Ryu and Nina to her castle. As she "closes" her
mind, the doors close. You need something to remind her of Alan. Better
return to him in Carmen.

*Carmen
Talk to Alan in the house next to the upper windmill-house. He'll tell
you that Cerl is acting this way because he abandoned her when she was
kicked out of town. He'll tell you to get the Fruit of the Holiday Tree.

*The World
ITEM: Fruit
PARTY: Ryu, Nina, Ox, Bleu
Go from Carmen to the southern coast. You'll find a ruined town, and a
big tree. This is the Holiday Tree. Have Ox punch it to get the Fruit.
Take it to Cerl's castle.

*Cerl's Castle
ITEM: TmKey
With the Fruit, Cerl will let you in. Enter and walk up to the second
floor. Cerl will let you take the TmKey from the chest. Do so. Then Goda
will appear and you will quickly flee. Alan will enter and Goda kills
Cerl. Then because the castle is controlled by her mind, and she no
longer exists, the castle no longer exists.
You will take the TmKey back to Tock. Then Nina shifts into a black
hole, and you follow. You'll end up back in Tunlan.

*Tunlan
Do you remember the person who looked like Nina, but had a blue dress
instead of a pink one? Well, go talk to her, in the middle-right room on
the level of the town below the castle. Now talk to the other two people
in her room. Now talk to the wise man by the Dragon Shrine. He'll tell
you that there is a famous doctor in Carmen. Go visit him.

*Carmen
Go to the windmill-house above the Weapon Shop. Talk to the man in the
straw hat. He is the doctor. He'll tell you he needs a C-Nut, W-Ant,
P-Fish, and Root, to make the Tonic. Exit the town.

*The World
ITEMS: P-Fish, Root, C-Nut, W-Ant
Go back to where Cerl's castle was. You can now go out a back entrance.
Now go up, then right, down, left, and follow the path to a broken
bridge. Now go fishing. You'll catch the P-Fish.
Now go to Gramor. Have Mogu dig in the dirt by the only plant
south-WEST of Gramor. You'll find the Root.
Have Bleu warp the party to Tunlan. Exit the town and have Ox punch the
palm trees until you get the C-Nut.
You can get a W-Ant by having Bo hunt a white-deer that randomly
appears after a battle. Use some Marble3 if you have to, so enemies
don't attack, because if an enemy attacks, the animals dissappear, with
any unclaimed items.
Take all four items back to Carmen.

*Carmen
ITEM: Tonic
Take all four of the items to the Doctor to get the Tonic. Take it to
Nina in Tunlan.

*Tunlan
Take the Tonic to Nina. She will rejoin you. Also, stop by the Flea
Market with Gobi, and you may be able to get the PowerRP, Mallet,
DwarfBW, and MaskSH. Return to Carmen.

*Carmen
ITEM: Pass
Go to the water-tub in the northeast corner of twon, and talk to the
wise man. Search the ground where he was standing for the Pass. Go to
Dragon Training northwest of Gust.

*Dragon Training
ITEM: Melon
PARTY: Ryu and 3 others
BOSS: Avion
LEVEL: 33
You must have the DragonAR (from Spring, unthawed) and have finished
step 2 to be able to enter.
Enter, and walk up to fight Avion. You will gain the Rudra Dragon's
power.

*The World
ITEM: DragonSH
Now go to the mountains east of Gramor, by flying, and you will find a
well with a DragonSH. Now go to an island northeast of Romero. You'll
find a Dragon Emblem.

*Dragon Emblem - Romero
ITEMS: S-Ptn, V-Ptn, Sash
Have Ox punch both weak walls. The upper-left one has a S-Ptn (with
Fire trap) and the upper-right chest has a Sash, with a Boom trap. The
center one has a V-Ptn. There is also a Health Spring here. But first,
go to the island with Pagoda on it, and search behind the towers for a
Tri-Rang. Fly southeast from Scande to another Dragon Emblem.

*Dragon Emblem - Scande
ITEMS: S-Ptn, A-Ptn, L-Ptn, Life2, AgileHT, LoveHT, StarSH, MystCW
Starting with the upper-left chest, the contents are listed above,
going in a clockwise direction. Now, you can FINALLY go to Scande.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     PART 10: THE FINAL BATTLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Scande
ITEM: Herb
You must have the Pass to be able to enter.
Go to the Inn. Check the dresser for a Herb. Talk to the wise man. Now
go and inspect the elevator. Talk to the person by the tower, who will
tell you a man from Spring was here.

*Spring
ITEM: B-Part
Talk to the man in bed in the house below the Inn to get the B-Part. Go
to Gant.

*Gant
ITEM: Part
Go to the second floor of the top house. Talk to the man's wife. She'll
wake him. Talk to the man there, and get the Part. Now go back to
Scande.
Climb the tower, and the wise man will tell you to get the D-Hrt from
Tunlan.

*Tunlan

Go straight up to find the house with a person who will bottle the
D-Hrt tune for later use. Now return to Scande, and Zog's Palace.

him. You'll return to 1F, and find Sara. She WASN'T killed in Drogen,
but captured. Ryu gives her the 6 keys, figured she's not going to do
much, being his sister and all. Well, she does take them, anyway, and
leaves. The Mole People appear. Fall in the hole.
Mole Hole - Talk to all the moles, and you will find a hole back to the
bottom level of Scande. You can find your way out from here. Return to
Agua.

*Agua
ITEM: FlameSH
PARTY: Karn and 3 others
LEVEL: 36
Go back up to the fifth floor, having Karn open the locked doors.
You'll find a FlameSH up on floor 5F, and a stairway to the top of the

stairway. Go up to 2F.
2F - Go right all the way, and into the East Tower. Go up when you can,
and left to the stairway. Go downstairs.
1F - Find your way around this room. I lost my map I drew of this room,
so I can't help much.
3F - Go up to fight Sara. Now go down the stairs to 2F. 
2F - Go west to the West Tower. Drink from the Health Spring. Go down
the stairs. Go along the outer perimeter of the wall to find the hidden
path around to the east side of the room. You'll find your way,
eventually, to Jade. Sorry, for much of this I don't know. I REALLY
can't help without my map I made.
Well, when you do find Jade, he blows up the tower, and activates
Obelisk. You return to Drogen. But first, you need the I-Claw. Go to the
weapon collector east of Gant.

woman and give her thr List. She'll give you the Wtzit. Take it to the
guy. He'll give you Note1 ("This is a tool of the Mole People"). Take it
to the woman, and get the Note2 ("Be my friend"). Take the note to the
guy, and get the I-Claw as your reward. 
You can enter Obelisk now, but first return to where the Cleansing
Water Spring is, and go down the stairs to find the Agni Dragon Attack.
You must have the Rudra Dragon Attack first, though.

is able to dig an entrance into here.

*Obelisk
ITEMS: FlameHR, StarHR, EmporSD
BOSSES: Goda, Jade, Goddess
PARTY: Ryu, Nina, Ox, Bleu

Take it across the gap. Go up, then left. Take either path, then left
across the gap to the stairway.

  item. Have Ryu use the IceDgn attack. Bo should cast Frost on
  RugaX. Bleu should use the Ice spell.
	HP - 1350        SPELLS: None

G. Fly - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 27
  Have Ryu cast BltDgn. Nina should use the RageHR as an item.
  Bo should cast Fry, and Ox should fight. It would help to use
  FortX after starting the fight.
	HP - 1200        SPELLS: None

FlowerX - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 27
  Have Ryu activate FirDgn power. Nina should cast FortX, and then
  use the FlameRP as an item. Bo should cast Flame, and Ox should
  fight with his weapon.
	HP - 2800        SPELLS: Poison

HornToad - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 27
  Have Ryu cast the BltDgn. Nina is best casting FortX, then use
  the FlameRP as an item. Bo should cast Fry, and order Bleu to
  summon the Gale spell.
	HP - 3600        SPELLS: 3.5

Mothro (without Mogu's Courage) -
  You can't beat him now. Just challenge him, but immediately run
  away.
	HP - 0           SPELLS: Rub, Para

Mothro (with Mogu's Courage)- RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 29
  Have Nina cast FortX and Shield on all party members. Ryu should
  use FirDgn. Ox should fight. Blue should use Char or FireX. Nina
  should use the FlameRP as an item to cast F.Ball.
	HP - 3400        SPELLS: Poison, Rub, Para

Mote (before Conscionce appears) - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 31
  Only attack with weapons. Mote regains his HP in the second part,
  so don't waste your stuff on him now.
	HP - 1500        SPELLS: None

Mote (after Conscionce appears) - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 31
  Have Nina cast FortX and Shield on the party. When Mote is in his
  "scrambled" form, use weapons. Bleu should use IceX, but ONLY
  when Mote is fully formed, into a floating-mushroom type thingy.
	HP - 8700 (I think) SPELLS: Char, FireX

Cerl - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 32
  Have Nina cast FortX on the party. Then use any strong spells
  you have. Cerl gives up when she loses about 75% of her HP.
	HP - 2600 (to win) SPELLS: None

Avian - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 33
  Have Ryu use the FirDgn power. This should be a rather easy
  fight.
	HP - 3000          SPELLS: None

Zog - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 36
  Have Nina cast FortX on the party, and Wall on all party members.
  Bleu should use Comet, and a WtrJr' if needed to recover all AP.
  Have Ox and Ryu fight. DO NOT use the D-Hrt in this fight. It is
  best saved for later.
	HP - 14700         SPELLS: Char, FireX

Sara - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 37
  It was naughty of Sara to knock off all your HP before the fight
  started. Better use CuraX to remedy that problem. Now to
  reprimand her for her deed. The D-Hrt, if you saved it from
  before fighting Zog, plus one weapon attack, ought to be an
  appropiate punishment.
	HP - 16000         SPELLS: Gale

Goda - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 39
  Have Nina cast FortX on the party to increase Defence. He doesn't
  have any spells, so you don't need to worry about any Magic. But,
  Bleu should use BoltX on him. Comet may also work, but you'll
  need a WtrJr' to heal her AP. Ryu should use Rudra power, and
  Ox should fight. Nina should just do her healing jobs.
	HP - 10700         SPELLS: None

Jade - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 39
  This is a toughie. Ryu should use Rudra. Nina should cast FortX
  and Wall on the party. Bleu should use BoltX. It is as effective
  as Comet, but uses less AP. You may still need a WtrJr' to heal
  AP. If you've equipped Bleu with the EvilCN before the fight, she
  can gradually recover AP as she swings her weapon. As for Ox, use
  ATK-Up on him, and just have him fight.
	HP - 22800         SPELLS: Chill, Rub

Goddess (Crying girl / easy) - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 40
  Just hit her with your best weapons. She wont try very hard.
	HP - 7200          SPELLS: None

Goddess (Crying girl / hard) - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 40
  If you want the real ending, use Agni immediately after starting
  the fight. But, if you don't have it, or you WANT the fake
  ending, have Ryu use the Rudra attack. Nina should cast FortX and
  Wall on the party, then use her mainly to heal. She should also
  cast ATK-Up on Ox. Ox should fight. Bleu should use BoltX or
  Comet, then use the StarHR as an item, when her AP runs out.
	HP - 25000         SPELLS: Chill

Goddess (Real form) - RECOMMENDED LEVEL: 40
  One way to do this is to load up on Cure, then have Ryu use Agni
  power, and use Cure when his HP runs low. Or else, this is a
  harder but effective route. Have Nina use FortX and Wall on the
  party, and ATK-Up on Ox, then heal as needed. Ryu should use the
  Rudra attack. Bleu should cast BoltX and Comet to attack, then
  use the StarHR as an item, to cast Comet.
