=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1   Across the Desert
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items       : King's Sword
New Member  : Nina, Ryu
Monsters    : None
W. Monsters : Cap, Eye Goo, Mage Goo, Scorpion
Boss        : None
Skills      :      
    Distracted    -->  Cap
    Rest          -->  Eye Goo
    Burn          -->  Mage Goo
    Blind         -->  Scorpion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nina and a guy call Cray is surfing across the desert to search for 
Nina's sister, Elina on a sandflier. A huge worm like creature emerges 
from the sand and chases after them. The creature eventually reaches 
them and send them flying off. The sandflier is filled with sand and 
Cray is unable to repair it without any spare parts. Cray stays back and 
watch the sandflier to prevent bandits from stealing it while Nina when 
off to a town call Sarai to get the spare parts. Cray hands the King's 
sword to Nina before she leaves. 

You will now control Nina and i suggest that you spend some time 
familiarise with the controls. After that, just head right from Cray to 
arrive at the world map.

Follow the dotted line and you will reach a point where a exclaimation 
will appear. Press X to enter and you will get to see another sequence. 
Nina will arrive at a huge hole and will fall into the hole. Well, it is 
not just Nina who is in the hole, a dragon is also in hte hole. Luckily, 
the Dragon will not attack, it will fly away, leaving a naked being 
behind. IF you have played previous Breath Of Fire titles, then you will 
know who the naked being is. He is Ryu, the main character of this game. 

Nina asks Ryu about the Dragon and how he ended up in the hole but Ryu 
knew nothing. As always, Ryu doesn't know where he is heading to and why 
he was here. Nina decided to bring him along with her to the nearest 
town. She also hands the King's sword to him. Now both of Nina and Ryu 
will arrive on the world map again. You may press the triangle button to 
set up a camp if you like. In the camp, you can rest, save, view skill 
and master lists. The skill and the master lists are not of your concern 
for now. I suggest that you save before doing anything.

After saving, it's time for you to get some money and skills from 
monsters. The starting 500 Z that you are given will not be enough to 
spend in the next town. Please do not enter the next area. First walk 
along the dotted line until you get question mark. Press X to enter when 
a question mark appear. Just 'loiter' around to get into random battles. 
When a battle occurs, select the guard command if you want to learn 
skills from the monsters. In order to learn the skill, you must guard 
until the monster uses the skill. Another bonus is that you can find 
random items in a black bag. When you run out of HP or AP, DO NOT use 
items, just head out of the area and replenish your HP and AP in a camp. 
I suggest that you raise Ryu level to at least level 4 before attempting 
to proceed. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2   The Cliff
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items       : Ammonia
New Member  : None
Monsters    : Cap, Eye Goo
W. Monsters : None
Boss        : None
Skills      : 
    Distracted    -->  Cap
    Rest          -->  Eye Goo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are ready, continue along the dotted route and enter the cliff. 
Once inside, Nina will tell you that you will have to go over the cliff 
to reach Sarai and she arge you to hurry and reach Sarai before darkness 
falls. Proceed down two slopes then down a stair. Head left and cross 
the bridge. Ignore the item bag that you sees for now, you will get it 
real soon. Cross under the arch and you'll see a wooden plank acting as 
a bridge. Before crossing the plank, proceed north and follow the short 
path to reach the item bag that you saw earlier. You'll get a Ammonia. 
If you have problem locating the path, try rotating the camera. After 
grabbing the item, head across the plank and continue to walk until a 
short sequence occurs. Part of the road break off and it seems that 
there is no way the two can get across. Nina will then teach you how to 
jump across to the other side. Well, all you can do is to listen and 
learn well. After the first jump, you will have to jump again. However 
on the second jump, Nina did not make it, she falls off the cliff but is 
saved by her own wings. Ryu goes after her but land up smashing his 
face.

Then you will be treated to another sequence and a fantastic piece of 
music. The sky turns dark and you'll have to find a place to rest. Head 
left and you will find a cave. Nina will suggest that they camp inside 
the cave. After the conversation, you will be switched to another 
place(surprise). After the sequence, you will control the mysterious guy 
called Fou-Lu which is damn strong!!! Before going anywhere, it is 
important for you to know something about this game. Fou-Lu and Ryu 
shares the same skills but not the same items, zenny and equipments. So 
you should try not to get any item bags or treasure while controlling 
Fou-Lu since Ryu will come to this place sometime later. Anyway i think 
you won't need much items for Fou-Lu since he is already VERY strong.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get out of the tomb, just run down the stair and you will reach the 
forest. Head left and up a ramp, then stand on the small piece of stone 
just next to the ramp to teleport to the other side. Note that there is 
a orange triangle on the stone. Once you get to the other side, head 
right to reach a fork. Ignore the north path, i will only lead you to a 
dead end. Instead, proceed along the south path to reach another fork. 
Ignore the path left path, just continue south and you will be stopped 
by two 'ignorant' guards. It seems that they are here to watch over this 
area as they were told that a Dragon will come here. They also intend to 
kill the Dragon. Fou-Lu then summons a Dragon. The dragon's attack leave 
a large crater behind. You will still control Fou-Lu after the sequence. 
Now Fou-Lu can transform into a dragon by using the meditate command. 
You might one to get into some battle and watch the cool transformation 
before proceeding past the crater and south to arrive at the world map.

Head left to arrive at another forest. This forest is pretty easy to 
navigate, just get to the top of the hill. At the top, you'll meet 
another mysterious guy called Kham. Kham knows about Fou-Lu and he will 
tell you about Fou-Lu. Fou-Lu is the first Emperor and he is the one who 
founded the great Fou Empire. He will battle you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Kham
Stats   :
HP: 15,000      EXP: 16,000       Zenny: 1,750       Spoils: Ambrosia 
Weakness: Water
Strength: Fire
Attacks :
Flaming Fist : Fire-based attack against one target 
Mystic Fire  : four times fire based attack 

This fight is pretty easy if Fou-Lu's remaining HP is pretty high. 
Change into the Astral Dragon in the first turn. In the dragon form, Ap 
will be drain and you will return to the human form once AP is all used 
up. You should be able to defeat this boss before the AP runs out. This 
boss is weak against water based attacks but i suggest that you save 
those AP and just use physical attacks. In no time, Kham will be wasted. 
Please note that his Flaming Fist attack misses a lot but his Mystic 
Fire has a hing accuracy. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately Kham will still be alive after the battle. He wants Fou-Lu 
dead! Fou-Lu escapes but Kham orders a few soldiers to set the trees on 
fire. You will then control Fou-Lu again. Proceed through the forest to 
reach the next area with a bridge. A sequence will occur after you 
approach the bridge. The red-nosed dwarf will introduce himself as Yohm, 
general of the Fou-Lu Imperial Army. He will then set the bridge on fire 
with the Flaming Fist(?!?) sending Fou-Lu off to 'hell'. He will then 
order his soldiers to search for Fou-Lu's body. 

You will control Nina and Ryu at last. They have climb their way back to 
the top. You can't climb down the stair so head up the ramp and head 
left to arrive at the world map. Again you can get into random battles 
on the world map if you want. Furthermore, you can test out Ryu's new 
special, the Aura Dragon transformation. Anyway, when you are ready to 
proceed, head into Sarai.

1.4   The First Town
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

              Power Food, 40+ Z
New Member  : None
Monsters    : None
W. Monsters : None
Boss        : None
Skills      : None
Item Shop   : Croc Tear [4Z], Healing Herb [20Z], Antidote [12Z],
              Eye Drops [14Z], Ammonia [250Z], Wooden Rod [50Z], 
              Baby Frog [20Z], Straight [20Z]
Weapon Shop : Sage's Staff [230Z], Leather Armor [220Z], Bandana [30Z],
              Brass Helm [90Z], Soul Gem [1000Z]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first town you will arrive. It is called Sarai. It is rather 
hard to navigate through this town as it was built like a maze. When you 
first enter, Nina will tell you that she is going to get some things and 
will leave you with three choice to choose from. Select "Sure!" or "I 
think so..." and she will leave you. If you select the last option, she 
will stick with you. Anyway, choose anything you like, as the story will 
not be affected in any way.

You will now be free to explore the town. Start off by slicing everyone 
with your sword. What I mean is that you can press triangle to use the 
sword on the villagers. They will drop some zenny and you will get the 
money. The money they drop range from 1 Z - 10 Z. Note that you might 
have to hit the same villager as much as eight times with your sword for 
them to drop the money. After having fun with your sword, you can 
continue to do some evil deeds...Enter every houses and search for 
items. 

You can visit the Weapon shop to buy some new stuffs. The weapon shop is 
the second stall from the entrance. The frog will sell you some new 
stuffs. Buy them if you can afford, but be sure to keep about 400Z for 
some mini-game later. Get a few soul gems and the leather Armor and Bass 
Helm for Ryu if you have the money. When you are ready, head to the left 
of the town to find a osrich and a few people. Nina is also here and she 
is lost. You can't do anything so head into the Tavern just beside the 
Osrich. 

In the tavern, head down the stair and talk to the green frog. He will 
offer you a 'treasure' for 158 Z. Don't worry, he is not cheating you, 
so buy it. You will find out that it is a Lead Ball. From this point 
onwards, you will find some treasures trader that will trade this Lead 
Ball for money. You can talk to the people here if you want or you can 
smack then for some money. Talk to the old man at the counter to proceed 
with the game. Before he is going to tell you anything about the 
Sandflier parts, you will have to treat him to a meal to make him happy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Satisfy the Old man
Fun Factor: 6/10
Difficulty: 3/10

You must feed the old man to make him happy meaning you must fill his 
happiness bar and not the Food and Drink Bar. Just Stuff him with Wine 
and Steak to make him really happy. Feed him Steak once, then Wine once 
and the process continues. Since you fed him those expensive stuffs, he 
will hands you a Panacea. He will automatically tell you that he is 
full. He will tell you to get further information from the information 
broker outside the Inn. 

If you do not have much money, you can always feed him those cheaper 
stuff, the Happiness bar will still fill up eventually but only slower. 
You can always buy a panacea from shops in later towns.
Note: Feed him a lot of expensive stuff and you'll get Panacea.
      Feed him a lot of cheap stuff and you'll get 2 antidote.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Head out of the Tavern and you will see Nina talking to the monkey(if 
you choose the first and second option). Talk to Nina and you will find 
out that the monkey has agree to help Nina find the parts in exchange 
for some money. Tell Nina that you don't trust him and you will not be 
cheated of some valuable money. After the conversation, Nina will rejoin 
you. Now head right from the town entrance to find the Inn. Talk to the 
man beside the vase outside the Inn and he will tell you to make a deal 
for the information.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Up or Down
Fun Factor: 3/10
Difficulty: 6/10

When you ask him about the sandflier parts, he will tell you that he did 
not have any but know someone who has it. Tell him that you are 
interested. Now you must pay for the information. The sum you offer must 
match with the price of the information. Just pay him slightly above 100 
Z and you'll get the information. Well, i paid 110Z for the information. 
If you are willing, pay 123 Z to him and he will tell you the 
information and give you a Ginseng. He will tell you to get the parts 
from the black market but you'll need a password. He also tells you that 
you can find one travelling merchant who know the password on the 
Highway, east of the town. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Before exiting this town in search of the merchant, you might want to 
stock up on some items and buy some new equipment for Nina. You can also 
buy some items and fishing stuffs from the third stall from the 
entrance. Buy one or two wooden rods and a few bait as you will be able 
to fish real soon. When you are ready, exit the town. 

Walk east from the town along the dotted line and you will come to a 
point where a question mark always appear. Enter and you'll find 
yourself in a desert area that is different from the random battles 
area. Follow the staight path until a path branches off. Take the short 
path and you will arrive at the world map again. Follow the short dotted 
route to arrive at a fish spot. You might want to spend some time here. 

Upon entering the fish spot, you will be taught how to fish. Press 
square to enter the menu where you can equip the type of rod and lure 
you are using and help and hints on fishing. Please read them to 
understand fishing better. There are four types of fishes available here 
for you to catch. Note that for now, you can only catch Jellyfish, Sweet 
fish and Trout with straight and baby frog. Come back later and try to 
catch the fourth type of fish(Rainbow Trout). After you have had fun 
with fishing, walk along the path between the cliff and Sarai until you 
get a question mark. Enter the area and you will find the merchant and 
the osrich. I 'think' you can meet him anywhere along the route.

Anyway, when you see him, talk to him. Luckily, he will give you the 
password for free. With the password in hand, head back into Sarai. YOu 
might have already spotted a guy sitting outside the town at a place 
where you can't seem to reach. Well, just head into the tavern, enter 
the counter and talk to the bar tender and he will allow you to enter 
the door. Before entering, search the cabinet beside him to find 40Z. 
Then enter the room and you will meet the fat guy. It seems that 
Sandfliers were used in war at some places and it is some sort of 
illegal to manufacture samdflier parts. Sadly, he did not have any 
sandflier parts but he will tell you about a place called Sandflier 
Valley where there are some buried sandflier parts. He promise to make 
you some sandflier parts out of some junks that can be dug out in the 
valley. Then you will control Ryu and Nina again. Search the cabinet for 
a power food which raises user attack power by 1. Used it on Ryu if you 
want. By the way, you should have also gotten a Aurum from him. When 
ready, head out of the town and take the new dotted route to arrive at 
the Sandflier Valley.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before entering the Sandflier Valley, you might want to consider saving 
or resting. Please also make sure that Ryu is at least level five before 
entering the valley. 

Once in the Valley, head up the fallen trunk and continue right until 
you see a green flag. Look carefully for a treasure chest. Open it to 
get 8 Croc Tear! You might also have spotted another chest while heading 
right to the green flag. NOw it is time for you to get the chest. Head 
south from the green flag and enter the broken hulk of the sandflier. 
Examine the wheel and turn it to the right. Now head back down the 
fallen trunk. and head right and up to get to the chest. Open it to get 
a stash of 200 Zenny!

Now head back and turn the wheel two times to the left. Head back down 
the fallen trunk again. Now head right past the previous treasure chest 
and enter the hole in the wrecked Sandflier, then down the plank and out 
of another hole. Enter the next hole in another Sandflier. Head up the 
stairs then climb up the ladder. Take the Brass Helm in the Chest. Climb 
back down te ladder and examine the device just next to the stair. It is 
a winch. Choose to operate it and the anchor of the sandflier will land 
on the sand. Head outside and step onto the anchor. It will take you to 
the higher lever. Get off it and head north to reach a building. 

Inside the building, you will find a old man and a dog. Whack the old 
man for some money if you want. Talk to him and he will tell you that 
you can dig them up in here. He will offer you his shovel and the dog 
for 25 Zenny each. I suggest that you loan both for easier finding. 
Anyway take the tool and the dog, then head out to the circular area for 
some digging time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Treasure Hunt
Fun Factor: 7/10
Difficulty: 4/10
 
Once in the circular area, read the instruction to understand the game. 
It will mention that the shovel will break after being used for a few 
times. As the dog is searching, it will bark, and you mush try your best 
to remember the location. The Ship Parts is around the middle of this 
circular area. There are also various good stuff buried in the sand. You 
should try your best to dig them up. The Shovel will break more easily 
when it hits a metal and the items but you can always get another shovel 
and the dog from the old man again. You can dig out 2 Glass Shard, a lot 
of Iron Scraps, a Milotov, Flattop and Sage's Staff and not just the 
ship parts. Digging out Iron Scraps, will cause the shovel to break much 
faster but you will find the uses of these metal shards in a later part 
of the game. Once you dug out the Ship parts and those items that you 
want, you are ready to proceed with the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Head back out of the Valley and onto the world map. Before heading back 
to Sarai, please rest up and save as you will be fighting a boss soon. 
When you are reading, enter Sarai. Talk to the villagers to find out 
that imperial troops have came here. Enter the Tavern and you will meet 
a imperial soldier. It seems that the soldier is trying to ask something 
out of the merchant that fell into the crater before Nina. The merchant 
resist and the soldier hits him with a magic spell. Just then, Nina will 
interrupt. The soldier notices that she is the princess of Wyndia and 
intends to grab her. He then summons a Warrior Spirit to take Nina. You 
will have to fight him with Nina alone. Ryu is no where to be seen...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Joh
Stats   :
HP: 1,200          EXP: 100          Zenny: 305          Spoils: Aurum 
Weakness: Water/Wind
Strength: Fire
Attacks :
Burn  : Weak Fire-based attack against one target
Flail : 8 times hits against one target

His physical attacks are rather accurate but not his Flail attack which 
hits for around 13 HP damage each hit. His Flail attack misses quite 
often. His burn attack is rather damaging but if you stick to spells and 
heal often, you will win this battle in no time. Have Nina keep using 
the Sever Spell. The Sever Spell will deal around 300 HP damage, so he 
should go down in about 4-5 turns. Once you have defeated him, he will 
break down into pieces.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now Ryu will come to help Nina. The soldier get really angry when Ryu 
smack him with his sword. Both of them make use of the opportunity and 
escape out of Sarai. You will now be on the world map again. Head along 
the main dotted route until a exclaimation mark appears. Enter to 
proceed with the game. After avoiding the sight of a few soldiers, you 
will meet up with the merchant again. He will tell you that there is 
another route in the desert that lead to a town called Chamba. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6   Chamba
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items       : Life Sandals, Panacea x2
New Member  : Ershin
Monsters    : None
W. Monsters : None
Boss        : None
Skills      : None
Mixed Shop  : Bowie Knife[150Z],Sage's Staff[230Z],Leather Armor[220Z],
              Brass Helm [90Z], Healing Herb [20Z], Antidote [12Z],
              Panacea [100Z], Ammonia [250Z]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon entering the town, Nina will ask you to find someone who can help 
them. Enter the first building near the entrance, then open the treasure 
inside for a Life Sandals. Then head out of the building and proceed up 
a stair to the upper level. Enter the first building you see. The orange 
frog in there will seel you items and equipment. Buy the Bowie Knife for 
Ryu and some restoring items. There is a inn at the right side. Talk to 
the small creature to rest if you need to. Also search the cabinet in 
front of the orange frog to find two panacea. Head out of this building. 

Again, you can smack people here with your sword for some money. Head up 
another stair to reach the top level. Talk to the old monkey(?!?) and he 
will tell you about why Chamba has 'shrinked'. It seems that part of the 
town has been polluted by toxic material called Hex. Hex was used during 
the war. Next, you will see a group of weird people arriving at the 
town. The old monkey will tell you that they are purifiers who job is to 
clear the hex. Now you must talk to those purifiers to find out more. 
Enter the house on the middle level, left of the old monkey. Inside, you 
will meet the leader of the purifiers, Tahb. He is the normal looking 
guy holding the pot. Keep choosing that you'll wait and you will chat 
with him. Nina will tell him that they need to get past Chamba as soon 
as possible. He will tell you that special armor is needed to enter the 
hexed area. Nina will be shocked to hear that at least one year is 
needed for them to clear all the hex. He tells you to get one of the 
purifiers to guide you through the area. Head outside and talk to 
everyone and you will be disappointed that on one wants to help you. 
Everyone claim that it is very dangerous to pass through the hex without 
armor and isn't willing to take the responsiblity. 

Talk to Tahb again. He is outside the house. He too will not take you 
through the hex and he also will not lend you any armor. Suddenly, a 
robot called Ershin will enter the town. She agrees to guide Ryu and 
Nina. Ershin will join your party! Now you are ready to proceed with the 
game! Before going anywhere, save at the inn. When you are ready, head 
out of the gate Ershin came in from.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before heading anywhere, you might want to change the battle formation 
if your party. Try your best to learn the two new skills. Please note 
that the walkthrough for this area will be based on the compass 
direction. Head south across a broad plank to reach a roof, then 
continue south and cross the bridge to find a chest with three Healing 
Herb. Now head back to the entrance on this area. Now head south again 
to the first roof. Head across the lower bridge and through the 
abandoned building. Head west along the bridge until it curve to the 
north. Then climb up the ladder and to reach the roof. Head south and 
down the ramp and onto the roof. Proceed to the next roof and head down 
another ramp to reach another bridge with two path, the south path and 
the east path. South path leads to a dead end so take the east path to 
reach another roof. Head north across the broad plank to yet another 
roof. continue north across another plank. Go up the roof and head east 
across another broad plank to reach the last roof of this area. Grab the 
300 zenny from the chest, then proceed across the last bridge to reach 
the next area. Ignore the chest you see for now. 

In the next area, my walkthrough will still based on the compass 
direction. Head west and you will get a sequence. Ershin will suggest 
that the party split up into two groups. Ershin will be alone and Ryu 
and Nina will scout the roofs. You can switch between group by pressing 
the select button. Control Ershin first. Climb down the ladder and stand 
beside the crater that is blocking the path. Now switch to Ryu and Nina. 
Now move north and jump over to the other roof. now stand on the crate 
in front of the entrance. It will be lowered. Now switch back to Ershin 
again. Using Ershin, past under the crate then head west, then south to 
find a ladder leading to the roof of the house. Get the Molotov from the 
chest. Switch to Ryu and Nina again. Climb back to the roof and the 
crate will be raised while the other will be lowered. Switch to Ershin 
and position him on the crate. Switch back to Ryu and Nina and you can 
now past the entrance without affecting the crate. Just after you cross 
the crate, Ershin will tell you to switch the valve at the other side. 
Continue south a little until you reach a fork. Take the east path to 
reach the previous screen. Grab the Waistcloth from the chest. Equip it 
on Nina to raise her defense. Head back to the previous screen and take 
the south path. Jump over to the other side and examine the valve. You 
will automatically be switched to Ershin. She must also activate another 
valve. Climb down the ladder and follow the path to reach the bottom of 
where Ryu and Nina is. Please do not take those side paths that take you 
to another screen. Examine the valve. 

Ershin and Ryu will both turn the two valves at the same time. The mist 
will be reduced. You will automatically head into the next area. Head 
west and jump to another roof. Then cross the bridge to the north. You 
will get a sequence while crossing. Something is hidden beneath the 
mist. Before going anywhere, make sure that every character is in top 
condition as you will face a boss very soon. When you are ready, proceed 
across the bridges and planks. While crossing the last bridge, the 
creature will attack and attempt to destroy the bridge. Keep pressing 
the 'O' button to run. You will fight the creature once you reach the 
other side of the bridge. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Skull Fish
Stats   :
HP: 2,400      EXP: 429      Zenny: 291     Spoils: Antidote, Fish Head 
Weakness: Holy-based attacks
Strength: ??? 
Attacks :
Vemon Breath: causes poison on all characters
Confuse     : causes confuse on one target

This fight may be tough without the correct strategy. Try not to use 
Ershin to attack as her attacks misses very often. Have her use antidote 
and restore the party. Ryu should always use Burn and Nina should always 
use Sever. The two magic will combine to form Firewind, a stronger form 
of magic. Keep your HP above 200 HP and you will wind in no time. Its 
physical attack can deal around 190 HP damage so watch out for the HP. 
Use panacea to cure confuse if needed. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you defeat the skullfish, climb the ladder and down another tall 
ladder to get out of this area. Once outside, you will have a short 
conversation and Ershin will join you. After she joins you, you will be 
on the world map again.

1.8   Dreamland

Items       : Aurum x2
New Member  : None
Monsters    : Toxic Fly, Armor, Gonghead
W. Monsters : None
Boss        : None
Skills      :     
    Chlorine      -->  Toxic Fly
    Wild Swing    -->  Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: My Walkthrough for this area is based on the compas direction.

The monster here is a bit tough but they give good experience. A toxic 
fly will give you 45 EXP, a Armor will give you 80 EXP and a Gonghead 
will give you 75 EXP. To defeat the toxic fly easily, use magic to kill 
it, avoid using physical attacks as they miss often on the fly. To 
defeat Armor, also magic combo as it has very high defense. You can try 
Firewind or you can Eruption. To get Eruption, combine Cray's rock shake 
and Ryu's burn or Hwa. Since the monsters here yield goo experience, so 
you should spend some time here leveling up your character. Furthermore, 
the Armor here will sometimes drop Raptor Claws and Cuirass which are 
very good items. Please note that they drop these items very rarely and 
you need to be very patient to get these items. You can also try some 
combos yourself. At this point of the game, you can already do 4 hit 
combo. Use the diary to rest and save if you need. 

When you are ready, proceed Head west past the opened steel gate. Then 
head north, then east to reach a staircase. There are two wooden doors 
next to the staircase. Enter the first room to find a item bag that 
contain a Aurum. The second room has no items, so head up the stair to 
reach the next screen. 

Head out of the door and down a stair to reach a corridor. Follow the 
corridor to reach another door. Enter and search the cabinet for another 
Aurum. Ignore the stair as it will take you to the locked room in the 
previous screen. Head into the curtain and a sequence will occur. Lord 
Yuna and his servant will enter the room. Cray will tell you to walk 
slowly behind the curtain. Listen to him and walk slowly behind the 
curtain. Head behind the curtain, then WALK to the other side and the 
dream will be over. 

Looks like the three of them had the same dream. Ershin will then tell 
you that it is Ryu's dream of a possible future. She also mentions the 
Dragon Eye which is a glimpse of what may be. After the conversation, 
you will be on the world map again. You will have to head to Kurok, west 
of Chamba. Note that you can now re-enter Sarai or go to the fish spot 1 
and fish. If you have gotten Flattop during the digging in Sandflier 
Valley, then you can use it to catch a rainbow trout.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before heading into Kurok, you may get into random battles along the 
path between Chamba and Kurok. The monsters give you good items and 
experience. There are a few new enemies here. Red cap, Flue Goo and 
Bandit are some new enemies that you will find on this path. You can 
learn the command skill from the red cap and you can get a Moon Sword 
from the Bandits here. Replace the Bowie Knife with the Moon Sword once 
you get it. Most of the monsters here come at least in pair. You might 
also encounter a super group with five caps and one red caps. Again, you 
can do more combos here. At this point of the game, you can already do 
10 hit combo which deal over 2000 HP damage. To get 10 hit combo, first 
get into a battle with 5 caps and 1 red cap. Have Nina use sever, then 
Cray use Rock Blast and finally have Ryu use Burn or Hwa to get a 10 hit 
combo which will deal more that 2000 HP damage. Now with this super 
combo in hand, you are more than ready to enter Kurok.

Once you are in Kurok Valley, continue along the path until it slopes 
down to a lower level. The wolf by the osrich is the first master, 
Rwolf. Talk to him and make Nina his apprentice. If you have done a 
combo of at least 5 hits, then you can talk to him again to learn the 
first spell, Eddy Skill. Let Ryu learns it as he will benefit from it. 
If you have done a 10 hit combo, then you can learn another spell, 
Plateau from Rwolf. Let either Ryu or Nina learns it. I suggest letting 
Nina learns it since she has high magical attack. 

Once you have finish with you master, head north then west and do not go 
down the ramp yet. Continue on the west path to reach a treasure chest 
that contains a Deep Driver. After taking it, continue down the ramp and 
continue west, then head east and continue along the path to reach the 
world map.

Boss        : None
Skills      :

    Rest          -->  Eye Goo
    Molasses      -->  Puspool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rest and save in the camp before going into the dam. You can also 
contine to try and get your 10 hit combo in this route. 

In the Dam area, you will get a conversation. A worker will tell you 
that most workers have left as a dragon is trashing about in the water 
and its movements have been unpredictable lately. He tells you to be 
careful while crossing before heading off. You will gain back control of 
the party. First climb down the ladder in front of the big machine, then 
desend down another ladder. Enter the doorway right of the ladder to 
reach a underground area.

Inside, take the west path and continue along the path until you reach 
outside again. Head down the stair and talk to the strong grey horse-
like person. After talking to him, take the ladder down and follow the 
wooden path. Talk to people on the way if you want. Jump across planks 
and follow the path until you reach the person at the end of the path. 
He will tell you that in order to get to the other side, you'll need to 
close the sluice. In order to close the Sluice, you will need the Sluice 
key. He also tell you that Rhoppe has it. Rhoppe is the person with the 
tube who you might have seen on the way. Head south from this guy to 
find the person with the tube. Talk to him and he will hand you the 
Sluice Key. 

With the key, you can now close the Sluice. Head back to the underground 
area then to the ladder. Open the steel gate in front of the ladder and 
you can not close the sluice. Pull the lever to close the Sluice. A 
wooden plank will be lowered. Now climb the ladder to go outside then 
climb up the ladder on the left. Head east, then cross the wooden plank 
to the other side. Climb up the ladder to reach a treasure chest that 
contains a Short Sword which you can equip it on Ryu. Climb back down, 
then head south and climb down another ladder. Head east to reach the 
other side. Enter the room and and open the gate, then pull the lever 
like what you did earlier but the big wheel will not turn. Then a mouse 
lady will enter and tell you that you'll need to turn the wheel very 
fast in order to get it work. Well, this is another mini-game for you! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun time  : Turn the Wheel
Fun Factor: 4/10
Difficulty: 3/10

Listen to the mouse lady carefully, so you will understand how to 'play' 
this mini game. She will tell you to turn the flywheel by hand and when 
the wheel is spinning fast enough, flip the switch. Read the instruction 
too. Ryu will spin the wheel and another person will pull the lever. To 
turn the wheel, keep turning the D-pad in clockwise or anti-closkwise 
direction and the wheel will spin. Wait until it start to produce high-
pitched sound, then press 'O'. If you done it correctly, the big wheel 
outside should turn and the wooden plank will be lowered. After that, 
the mouse lady will give you items for your hard work. Note that you 
will get different items depending on how many times you take to get the 
work done. If you just take one try, then you will receive a toad and if 
you take two tries, then she will give you a silver top. I am certain 
that there are other prizes but i'm not going to find them out. E-mail 
me about other prizes and i will add them as soon as possible. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, head out of the underground area through the south doorway. Head 
west and collect two vitamins from the chest. Head back into the 
underground area and climb up the ladder. Once outside, head west all 
the way, then up the ladder then head east and across the wooden plank 
that you had just lowered. Continue east a little then climb up the 
ladder to reach the big wheel. Head east and turn to the north corner 
and pick up two swallow eyes from the chest. Climb down the ladder and 
continue east and enter the doorway to reach another underground area.  
Run through the underground passage and out of the underground area to 
reach outside again. Head across the wooden planks then climb down a 
ladder to reach a platform with a blue lever. Examine the blue lever to 
lower a bridge. 

Now head back and talk to man who told you about the key. You will give 
him back the key so that he can operate the lift. He will order Rhoppe 
to open the sluice. A rat guy will hit the bell and inform everyone that 
the sluice has broken and the mud has overflowed. The damn guy will 
leave you with a crank and tell you to operate the lift yourself. You 
must attach the crank to the box on the lift and pull on it a few times 
to operate it. Head back across the bridge that you have just lowered. 
Just right of the bridge is the lift. Examine the box on the lift and 
Ryu will use the Crank. The lift will not seems to work and Nina suggest 
that you move the handle somemore. Press 'X' rapidly to lower the lift. 
Everyone will get out just before the whole place is covered with mud. 
Then you will also get to see the man with the tube spinning about. You 
will now be on the world map again. 

Head north and a exclaimation mark will automatically stop you. Enter to 
reach an area where the dragon will appear. Another old rat lady will be 
there. She offers to sing you songs. DO NOT pay 100 Z for the song 
because you will waste 60 Z. Just choose to pay 10 Z everytime she asks 
you. She only has four songs to sing so if you choose to pay 10 Z each 
time, you will only have to pay 40 Z for the so call song of the dragon. 
After the singing, the dragon will disappear and you will be back on the 
world map again. Head east to reach Kyria.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Orange Frog near the entrance will tell you to be careful in this 
town. Listen to him as this town is full of traps. Avoid stepping on 
suspicious spot on the ground as it will trigger a trap and you CAN be 
caught in the trap. Enter the house near the entrance and talk to the 
people inside to find out that the Mayor set the traps to ensure the 
safety ofthe villagers. Head out of this house after talking to 
everyone. The next house is a Inn, enter it if you need to rest or save. 
AVOID the food on the ground as stepping on it will trigger an explosion 
but luckily even if you happen to step on it, you won't take any damage. 
Ignore the house next to the food trap because there is nothing inside 
accept some vases and bags. There is another trap north of the bridge 
but you will not get caught in it since there is nothing beyond the 
bridge. IF you ever get caught in the trap, press the D-Pad is different 
directions to shake off the trap but you will take some damage if you 
step on this trap. 

Cross the bridge to reach the other side of the town. While crossing the 
bridge, avoid the trap that is on the bridge. On the other side, there 
will be two guys. The thin guy is the one who set the food trap and the 
Fat one is the one who set the bear trap. Now PURPOSELY step onto the 
food trap to cause an explosion. Talk to the thin guy a few times and he 
will give you a Belladonna. The path beside the fat man leads you up the 
mountain which is guarded by a guard. Then you will find two small holes 
on the ground. Stepping on them will cause you to fall to an underground 
area. First purposely step onto the trap left of the fat man. You will 
fall down to the area below. Get the 400Z from the chest then head your 
way to a ladder. Climb up the ladder and you'll find yourself trap 
between barrels. Just use Cray's push ability to push away the barrels. 
Exit the house, then head across the bridge again. Now you must find the 
Mayor. The house on the other side of the bridge is the Mayor's house. 
When you enter through the door, the parrot will set a cage down, 
preventing you from entering the house. Well, there is a fish lure in 
the house, so how are you going to get it? Well, drop through another 
hole on the ground, then climb up the ladder to find yourself inside the 
Mayor's house. Search the cabinet for a Fish Head. The Mayor is missing 
and it seems that you might be able to get information out of the 
parrot.

Talk to the parrot. Choose "We really have no time for this...", then 
"No" two times, then "Not really", then finally ask the parrot about the 
Mayor. It will tell you that the Mayor has gone to the woods. Now you 
must search for the Mayors. Before heading out of this town, there are 
still some more 'fun' things to do. Check the dog house by the Mayor 
house to fight a Beetroop. Just hack it with magic to defeat it. There 
is also a girl who will ask you to stand under the metal. Ignore the 
trick. There is a puppeteer who will tell you more about the basics of 
this game. Be sure to talk to her. If you have notice carefully when you 
first came into this town, there is a treasure chest behind the first 
house. Well, it contains no treasure but three Chest Devils. There is no 
point fighting these creatures as they give you pathetic EXP. However if 
you want to fight them, just head behind the third house and across the 
back of the second house to reach the treasure chest. When you have had 
fun with the traps and everything, talk to the Manillo a.k.a "Orange 
Frog" by the entrance to buy equipments and items. Buy some Molotov, 
Glass Domino and Waistcloth. After stocking on items and equipments, 
head out of this town.

    Rest          -->  Eye Goo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Head into the woods when you are ready. Once in the woods, follow the 
path through the forest until you reach a point where there is a person 
and a apple tree. Knock the tree with Ershin's head butt ability and you 
can get unlimited amount of apples. One apple will replenish 100 HP so 
get some for your trip through the forest. Once you are done with 
ripping the apples off the tree, talk to the man blocking the path. He 
will tell you that the Mayor is lost in the woods. He also tell you that 
the Mayor might have been taken by the boar or step into his own trap. 
He will then hands you an apple and tell you that by placing it on a 
stump in the woods, you can lure the boar out. He also tell you to be 
caurefull of traps in the woods.  

Now head north to find a sign board with a arrow pointing to the east. 
Head east and into the next screen. Head east a bit and you'll come to 
well. Run up the slope to the right of the well and continue to the 
east, ignoring the stump until you come to a cage trap. If you get trap 
by the cage, you'll need to ram the cage a few times to get out. Fall 
into the hole next to the cage. 

In the underground area, collect 4 Healing Herbs from the chest. Then 
make your way to a wall with some attached stone. Climb up and out of 
the well. Head south from the well to come to a pole with a metal weigh 
attached. If you stand below it, you will get crushed and you will get 
confuse for a few seconds. When this happens, your character will move 
in the opposite direction. There is another cage trap east of this pole. 
North of this cage trap is another slope. Head up the slope to reach a 
pole with a treasure. Now stand below the treasure and get it by it. You 
will get the Pointed Stick which is in the treasure chest. After getting 
the useless stick, head back to the second cage trap. 

Head south from the cage trap and down a slope, then east up a slope. 
Fall down the hole to reach the centre of the undergound area. Get Aura 
Ring from the chest. Aura Ring will increases wearer's resistance to 
Mind attacks. Equip it on anyone you like. Now head out of the well. 
Place an apple on the stump nearest to the well(beside the slope). 
Again, a boar will come out, follow its track and avoid all traps to 
reach the next screen. Take the Earth Ward from the chest then head to 
the previous screen. 

Head to the tree stump near the entrance. Examine and place a apple on 
the stump. A boar will come ou and eat it. Follow its track, avoiding 
all traps and reach the next area. The next area is a waterfall area. 
The is a Wisdom Seed at the top of the waterfall and another path at the 
north. After getting the Wisdom Seed, Head into the next area through 
the north path. You will find the Mayor there. A boar will appear and 
step onto an explosive trap setted by the Mayor. It manages to escape 
and the Mayor will become real happy that his trap worked. Suddenly, a 
BIG Mammoth will drop from the sky and challenge your party to a fight.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Maman
Stats   :
HP: 3,500     EXP: 1,500     Zenny: 450     Spoils: Apple, Flame Punch
Weakness: ???
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Rock Blast: Weak earth-based attack against everyone
Body Press: Physical attack against one target

By the size of this creature, you should know that it is very strong. 
Yeh, it is true. Its physical attack can be deadly if you are on low 
level. Use Ryu, Cray and Nina. If Ershin have the Raptor Claws, use here 
instead of Cray. Cray will not be very useful in this battle since this 
boss is rather strong against earth attacks. Transform Ryu into the Aura 
Dragon in the first round and have Ershin/Cray and Nina attack. On the 
second turn, Ryu should cast Hwa and Nina should cast Cyclone if she has 
it to form Simoon. If not just use Hwa and Sever to get a Firewind. 
Continue to use this tactic until this mammoth goes down. Heal your 
party when neccessary. Beware of its Rock Blast attack which can damage 
everyone. Its Body Press shouldn't be a problem but it can stun the 
target sometimes. You will receive an apple and a Flame Punch for Ershin 
after this battle. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle, everyone will head out of the woods automatically. 
Return to Kyria. The Mayor will tell you why there are so many traps in 
this town. It seems that the Mayor is a very responsible person. He will 
promise to give you the permission to enter the passageway in the next 
morning. 

The screen will now be switched to Fou-Lu again. Well, he survived the 
fall and was saved by a person called Bunyan. If you have played BOF 
III, you should recognise this person but this time he has more beard:) 
He lives in the Zhinga Mountains. Remember that he lives in the Zhinga 
Mountains because he is one of the master in this game. Fou-Lu tries to 
leave but collapse after a few steps. Bunyan will bring Fou-Lu back into 
the house and rest.

Now then screen will switch back to Ryu and friends. In the morning, you 
will get the permission to use the passageway from the Mayor. Before you 
can go up the hill, Cray will fall down a hole. Get back up then you are 
ready to enter the passageway. Before you go, stock up on items and save 
at the inn.

The layout of the town is even much more complicated than the layout of 
Sarai. It is like a maze. The house next to the well is a orphanage. 
Enter and talk to the lady inside. Before she will talk to you, she will 
have to feed the children. Talk to the kids inside to find out that 
there was another kid call Chino who isn't in the orphanage. Head out of 
this building and you will see a funny sequence. A lady is chasing after 
a 'dog' kid but fall down in the end. This 'dog' kid is Chino. Head west 
from the well and through an arch. Follow the outer section of this town 
until you reach a stair. Climb it and you will get to the top section of 
this town. Make your way to where the lady tripped over. Talk to the 
lady and she says that she must catch Chino. Why not do something good 
by helping her out. As you approach the Chino, he will run off. You must 
now catch him. Now chase after him. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Catch Chino
Fun Factor: 5/10
Difficulty: 8/10

You can catch Chino by getting close to him and talking to him. He'll 
run in the opposite direction if he sees you coming, so get ahead of him 
and wait to cut him off. Keep staying on the high outer section where 
the lady is. He will run around the edge of the town and come up from 
stairs to the upper section where you are. As you see him runing around 
the edge of the town. Chase him and he will change direction. Predict 
where he will come out, then get there before him and wait for him. 
After catching him, you SHOULD be very familiar with this town. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, after catching him, he will return with the lady to the 
orphanage. 

Sister Lyte will invite you upstair to talk. She tells you that Princess 
Elina did visit this orphanage and gave the orphans many clothings and 
gifts. Lyte did not know where Elina went. Then Chino will enter the 
room and tell you that he has the whereabouts of princess Elina. Before 
he is going to tell you, you must play a game of hide and seek. Well, 
playing hide-and-seek in this maze-like town will be very fun.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Hide-and-Seek
Fun Factor: 8/10
Difficulty: 6/10

The children from the orphanage are hidden somewhere in the town and it 
is up to you to find them. To catch them, find them and talk to them one 
by one. You can see how many children you have left to catch by 
returning to the orphanage and counting how many children are there. By 
the way, there are a total of seven kids. It shouldn't be too hard to 
round up all seven kids as the kids will give you the location of other 
kids. 

One of them is walking about inside the orphanage. Speak to her to catch 
her.

There is another kid in the orphanage. The kid who is mopping the floor 
in the orphanage will tell you that Rudd is hiding under the eastern 
wall. By the way this kid is called Jahn.

Just west of the well under the arch is another kid. He will tell you 
where Goete is. He mentions that he has saw Goete going off towards the 
gate.

Head to the gate in this town to find Goete. The gate is at the west 
side of the town. 

Now head out of the arch and along the outer section of this town until 
you reach a stair. There is a kid standing on the stair. You cannot see 
him carefully but he's there. This is Rudd She will tell you that Modo 
is hiding in somewhere difficult to spot. She will tell you to try 
looking north from the top of the bridge to spot him.

Now head to the top outer section of the town. Head to the bridge and 
look north while walking across it. You should spot a frog kid next to a 
lady. He is Modo. He will tell you where Konoko is. He will tell you how 
to get to him. From the place you are, walk 6 steps south, then 16 steps 
west, then north 1 step, then west 3 steps, then south 3 steps, and then 
west another 4 steps to find Konoko. Ignore his direction. Just head to 
the orphanage and he will tell you to go to the Inn.

Konoko is the last child you'll need to find. He is in the Inn. The Inn 
is located left of the gate where Goete is. Head into the Inn, then up 
the stairs. You will find Konoko here. Catch her and congraduate 
yourself for completing this mini-game. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Return to the orphanage after you have found Konoko. Talk to the lady 
and she wil tell you that Chino is missing and the Frog Kid will tell 
you that Chino is hiding in the cellar. Then you will be shown the 
staircase leading to the cellar. 

Now you must head into the cellar to search for the brat. There are 
monsters in the cellar so stock up on items if you need. Use the Inn if 
you need too. The orange Manillo in front of the Inn will sell you 
items. Another orange Manillo in the second level of the Inn will sell 
you weapons. By a Scramasax for Ryu, a Magic Ward for Nina, a Steel Bat 
for Cray. You can buy some Chain Cap if you want, but they are heavy. 
Now its time to get into the Cellar. 

Talk to the guard at the south-west corner of the town. It's the top 
outer section. Talk to him and he will get paranoid and shout, then he 
will get thirsty. Now stand at the corner and wait. Wait till a lady 
holding a vase approaches the Guard. The guard will head off to get a 
drink from her. When he does so, sneak into the cellar. If the guard 
didn't head off to get the drink when the lady approaches, try talking 
to both of them, then try again.

Once you head down the stair the guard is guarding, you will be inside 
the Cellar. Head down the next stair into the next area. In the next 
area, head into the hole. Enter the first room and search the left shelf 
for a Ammonia. The next room only has two beds so you should not enter 
it. Head north into the hole to reach the next area. In the next area, 
head down the stair to the next area. The next area is a storage room 
and it is a maze. The shelf west of the stairs has a protein. Take it 
and head south to get out of this room. 

In the next area, head up the stair. Examine the west shelf for 80 Z. 
Then head east into the next area. In the next area, continue along the 
corridr then down the fleet of winding stairs and into the next area. 
The next area is the cell room and you should have saw Chino when you 
enter this room. Chino has blocked the steel gate with a barrel so you 
cannot reach him yet. Head to the next cell and get the item bag that 
contains a Raptor Claws. Equip it on Ershin. Now head out of the cell 
and head into the next area. Head up two stairs to reach another room 
with two more cells. Step onto the circular wooden plank in the bottom 
cell and you will fall down. You will now be in the cell with Chino. 
Talk to him and you will automatically return to the orphanage. Chino 
will now finally tell you the whereabouts of princess Elina.

"That" day, Chino had followed princess Elina all the way to the gate. 
He saw people coming up to her and talk to her. He will tehn tell you 
that Marlok, the shop owner was one of them. The big house guarded by a 
bodyguard in the middle of town is Marlok's mansion. You will thank the 
sister and Chino before heading out of the orphanage. Before talking to 
the half-naked person guarding Marlok's house, rest and save at the Inn 
first as you will be fighting him. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Kahn
Stats   :
HP:3,000           EXP:1,000           Zenny:0           Spoils:Ginseng
Weakness: None
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Shout: Inflict 'stun' on everyone with some accuracy.
Focus: Gain attack power for the next turn.

Kahn has strong physical attack and rather good defense so to win this 
battle easily and faster, use magical attacks. Kahn is a little 
resistance to earth-based attacks. When your character is stun, he/she 
will lose the turn and lose their current action. I suggest that you 
play around with him first until you have learn the focus skill from 
him. Try your best to learn this skill. Do not hurt him a lot before 
learning this skill as he seldom uses Focus when his Hp is low. When you 
have learnt the skill, throw everything at him. Have Cray cast Rock 
Blast than Ryu cast Burn to cast Eruption and have Nina cast Sever to 
make him go down faster. In a few rounds, he will go down.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Kahn, you will meet Marlok outside the house. He will 
praise you and invite you to his house. Marlok said that Princess Elina 
might have been taken to the west. He will agree to help you on one 
condition. You must catch a theif who has stolen some of his money. 
Everyone leaves the house but Nina has to stay behind to do some work. 

Rest and save at the inn. Talk to the merchant near the town gate. He 
will tell you that he saw a fellow with a big and heavy bag heading out 
of this town on the Eastern Highway. Head out of this town through the 
gate after talking to him. A new route will appear on the world map. 
This route join Synesta and the Bandit's Hideout. Follow the route and 
enter the area when a question mark appear between the Hideout and 
Synesta. You will find the bandit by a water source. Cray will approach 
him and talk with him. Once Cray mentions 'Marlok', the bandit will run 
away. You will now be switched back to Nina who is being 'harressed' by 
Marlok. After the sequence, your party will automatically arrive at the 
Hideout.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter the crack in the mountain to reach where the hideout. Head east to 
find the bandit. Approach him and he will run away. You are now going to 
catch him.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Catch the Theif
Fun Factor: 4/10
Difficulty: 8/10

To catch the theif, get close to him and press the 'X' button. He is 
really fast and hard to catch. To catch him, you'll have to block the 
passageways. You must push the barrels to block the passage using Cray's 
push ability. After he ran away, DO NOT chase after him. Wait till the 
camera zoom out. You will see that you are standing at the centre of a 
'Y' path. Block the right with the two barrels nearby, then chase after 
him and make him run in a clockwise direction. When he reaches the 
blocked path, he will turn and run in the other direction. This is the 
time you will catch him. After a few attempt, you should catch him. If 
you mess up, head out of this area and try again. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After catching him, he will tell you that those money belong to him and 
he will not return them to Marlok. Cray suggests that the party return 
to Synesta and have a little talk with Marlok. After the conversation, 
you will be outside the hideout. The bandit whom you were chasing a 
while ago is actually a master. Make him your mastr if you need but the 
price is very high! You must give him ALL your money in order for him to 
become your master. Ignore him for now. Head out of the area and get 
back to the world map. Return to Synesta and talk to Marlok. He will 
then send you do to another job. He 'order' you to go to the Sandflier 
Wharf north of Synesta. 

Now you can apprentice under Stoll, the bandit if you want. If you 
intends to do so, spend all your money, then smack anyone for a few 
zenny. Return to the hideout and give all the money to the bandit. He 
will agree to be your master. I suggest that you make Cray his 
apprentice since he is so slow. You will have to have at least 80 items 
in your inventory before he will teach you the first skill. Well, you 
definitely wouldn't have so much items at this point of the game, so 
head off to the Wharf but come back later when you meet the requirement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Head to a point between the sandflier wharf and Synesta where a question 
mark appears. Enter to find yourself in a desert. There should be a 
signboard in the desert stating that there is a fishing spot at the 
northeastern corner of the desert. Now head to the northeastern corner 
of this area to return to the world map. A new route leading to a new 
fishing spot will appear. After the long journey, you may want to relax 
yourself and catch some fish in the fishing spot.

Anyway, when you are ready, Enter the wharf. Head up the stairs then 
talk to the person wearing white shirt. He will give you a job to do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Tidy the Storeroom
Fun Factor: 5/10
Difficulty: 8/10

You need to move all the barrels and jars and line them up where they're 
supposed to go. Those old barrels are not need anymore. Break those old 
barrels if they are blocking the path. After talking to the man, head 
into the room to start working. Read the instruction once more if you 
need. The jars need to be put in the front of the sign in the north end 
of the room and the barrels need to be put in front of the sign in the 
south end of the room. Use Cray's ability to do so. Use Ershin's head 
butt ability to destroy those old and useless barrels. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After tidying up the storage room, you will be given another job. You 
must load the crates onto the sandflier. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time  : Load the Crates
Fun Factor: 7/10
Difficulty: 6/10

Use the crane to load the freight onto the ship. Use the directional 
buttons to move the crane arm. When the hook is directly obove a 
container, press the 'O' button. If you're on target, the hook will 
catch and you can lift the container. You can lower containers you've 
picked up into the ship by pressing the 'O' button again. The ship can 
carry up to 10 containers. Try to load as many as you can in the time 
limit. Use the hook's shadow to guide you as you move the crane. You get 
extra points for putting a container on spaces marked with a blue 
square. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After finishing the job, Nina and Marlok will arrive. Marlok will award 
you with items depending on how well you did the job. Well, you will 
most probably get a Straw after the job, unless you are perfect in the 
crates loading. He will let you ride on his sandflier and give you the 
VIP room. To your surprise, your party will be packed into crates and 
Marlok gives the 'excuse' that he is smuggling your party into the enemy 
territory so he must be very careful. After this sequence, the screen 
fades and you will control Fou-Lu again.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you control Fou-Lu, use the dairy to save. Head out of this house 
and head your way down the mountain to reach the next screen. The two 
proteins are located at the back of the house. I suggest that you leave 
it for Ryu's party. 

In the next screen, you will fight snap flies but they shouldn't pose 
any problems. One or two physical strikes from Fou-Lu should kill it. 
You can learn the flame strike from the snap flies here. By the way, all 
skills learned by Fou-Lu will go to Ryu. Anyway if you have learn it 
already, then ignore this skill. Well, there is another way to learn 
this skill. The method is to let Ryu use Aura dragon's flame strike than 
have someone guard and you will learn it eventually. Continue along the 
mountain path until you meet up with that old dwarf, Yohm and his guard. 
Then you will fight a huge owl-like creature. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Khafu
Stats   :
HP: 20,000   EXP: 22,000    Zenny: 5,800    Spoils: Fire Ward, Ambrosia
Weakness: Water and Wind
Strength: Fire  
Attacks :
Eldrich Flame : six-hit fire attack against one target
Heal          : Restore a small amount of HP to one target
Firewind      : Fire + Wind based magical attack against all

Transform into the Astral Dragon in the first round as in dragon form, 
the Eldrich Flame will not hurt you much. Note that the Eldrich Flame is 
very accurate and misses rarely but its damage somehow decreases with 
Khafu's HP. Since he is weak against water-based attacks, so use Frost 
Strike to hit him for more than 4000 HP damage. Avoid using Bing which 
is also a water-based attack as it does not deal as much damage as Frost 
Strike. He should go down in 5 - 6 turns. Keep in mind that during the 
battle, it might heal itself using heal. 

If you did fight some monsters on the way here and around the tomb, 
after this level, Fou-Lu should become Level 65.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle, Yohm will mention about Fou-Lu's the other half. You 
might be able to think who is the other half at this point of the game 
already. Anyway, after the conversation, Fou-Lu will transform into a 
dragon and flies off. Yohm orders Khafu after him and despite few 
attempts to avoid the Eldrich Flame, Fou-Lu was still hit in the end. He 
falls into the forest. Now game will switch back to Ryu and friends. 
They have arrived at the wharf near Kyoin.

              Glass Domino [220Z], Soul Gem [1000Z]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow the path the guards leave and you will arrive at Kyoin. The first 
stall near the entrance is the Weapon Shop. Buy the scramasax for Ryu, 
Magic Ward for Nina and Steel bat for Cray if you haven't done so. Buy 
the Crepe Cape for Nina. Buy some items from the person beside the 
stairs if you need. Make sure you buy some vitamins. The house behind 
the item shop is the Inn. Rest and save if you need. 

Head to the top of this town and up the stairs to enter the Imperial 
Causeway built by the first emperor. Once you are in the Imperial 
Causeway, head out through the south doorway into the next area. In the 
next area, you will encounter Armors and its your chance to get the 
cuirass from them. Now they will appear in pair and the chance that they 
will drop the cuirass will be higher. When you are ready. head up the 
stairs into the next area. Take the elevator to the upper level. Enter 
to be inside again, then head through the doorway into the next area. 
There will be a fork, take the east path first and enter the first room. 
Check the west most shelf for three healing herb. Head out of this room 
and and continue along the east path as it turns to north. Head up the 
stairs into the next area. 

In the next area, continue along the path and enter the first room you 
come to. Open the treasure chest for a Glass Domino. After taking it, 
exit this room and enter the next room. Follow the path and head up the 
stair into the next area. In the next area, head out to be back outside 
again. You can use the elevator at the centre to reach the floors below 
if you want. Once outside, make sure your team is in top condition, then 
take the elevator up. Once you reach the top, the lift will 
automatically descend and the gate will automatically activate. Now 
cross the bridge and after a few steps, the general who you met at Sarai 
will stop you. He will throw another warrior spirit to fight you. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Ymechaf
Stats   :
HP: 6,000       EXP: 2,000       Zenny: 0      Spoils: Aurum, Ice Punch
Weakness: Wind
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Whirlwind: Three-hits attack against all 
Sever    : Weak Wind-Based attack against one target

This boss's whirlwind attack is rather deadly and its HP is quite high, 
so a strategy is definitely needed here. Have Ryu use Burn and Nina use 
Sever or Cyclone if you have it, then have Cray attack. After the combo, 
Ymechaf should turn around and become off balance. Cray's attack should 
deal around 850 HP damage. In 5 - 7 turns, this boss should go down. 
Please make sure that you keep everyone HP above 250. If anyone runs out 
of AP, bring Ershin in and make her use physical attack. Bring the 
person in and Ershin out when there is enough AP to use a few spells. 
Avoid using Earth-based attacks in this battle since he is strong 
against Earth. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle, Rasso, the general will be shocked that Ymechaf was 
defeated. The gateway will start to close. Your party will jump into it 
and arrive at the next part of the imperial causeway just in time. Rasso 
will be left behind, but still shock from the event. 

Take the lift down then enter the tower. You will find a elevator 
inside. Take it if you do not want those items. I suggest that you don't 
use the elevator. Head down the stair to the level below. Follow the 
path to reach the next area. In the next area, enter the first room you 
come across. You will find the elevator platform inside. Take the two 
Ammonia from the chest then head back to the previous screen. Continue 
along the path and head down the stair to reach the next area. In the 
next area, continue along the path and enter the first room you come 
across. Search the eastern most shelf for a Vitamin. Now head back to 
the top and take the elevator to the first floor. Then exit through the 
doorway with light. You will arrive outside. Talk to the two guards 
outside and they will tell you that they are waiting for captain Rasso. 

Head down the stair and out of the Imperial Causeway to arrive on the 
world map again.

              Talisman [300Z], Soul Gem [1000Z]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once on the world map, do not hurry into Astana. Save your game then 
prepare yourself to do something hard for a skill. You can learn icicle 
from Goocounts found on this part of the world map. You may encounter 
them in pair or single. You can only learn icicle form a battle with one 
Goocount. Get into random battle with A Goocount. When you fought it for 
the forst time, you will notice that it guards the first round and the 
game will say that it is counting something. From the second round 
onwards, it will keep on using Frost. In order for it to use icicle, you 
must use a 5-hit combo on it. To get a 5-hit combo, have Cray cast Rock 
Blast, then Nina cast Plateau and Ryu cast Burn. This will result in a 
5-hit combo. Cray's Rock Blast will hit once, Nina's Plateau will hit 
twice and Eruption will also hit twice. Even though this combo is not in 
the slowest to fastest order, it still work 75% of the time. If you have 
no luck pulling off the combo using this method then switch Ryu's Burn 
and Nina's Plateau. Now the combo will be in slowest to fastest order 
and it will work most of the time. Anyway, after pulling off the combo, 
Goocount will powerup and will keep using icicle until it dies. Just 
guard to get the skill. After the Goocount powerups, you will also get 
four times more experience. After getting this useful skill, head into 
Astana.

Astana is a town with very dense china's tradition. Everyone is dressed 
in their traditional constumes which is kind of cool since there are few 
chinese wearing traditional constumes nowadays. You will notice the 
super huge cannon that runs through the whole town. It is a Carronade 
and during the war, it is used to shoot hexes to blast enemy towns. 
Well, there is a small shop, a inn and a gatehouse in this town. You 
will find the weapon and item dealer in the shop. Buy some Face Guards 
and Talismans. Buy some items if you need too. When you are done 
shopping, talk to everyone in town including two guards in the 
gatehouse. After talking to them, you will find out that the Army had 
built the aqueduct to supply water to cool the Carronade. Head out of 
the town and a new route will appear on the world map.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Chlorine      -->  Toxic Fly   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before taking the new route into the aqueduct, try to get everyone's 
level to around 15 so that you won't have much problem going through the 
aqueduct. Anyway, head into aqueduct when you are ready. 

In the first area of aqueduct, head your way to the north east and head 
up the ladder. Head east to get ot a chest containing a ginseng. After 
grabbing it, run back to the west and head up another ladder. Head east 
under a arch and talk to a little 'mole' man. He will activate the 
gondola. After the gondola is activated, ride it down then cross the 
wooden plank to the south. Slash the string tied to the drawbridge with 
Ryu's sword to lower the drawbridge. To return to the entrance, just use 
the drawbridge. There's no point going back to the entrance, so continue 
to the east and jump over to the wooden plank on the other side. Climb 
up the ladder and continue to the east to find a chest with a stash of 
500 Z. Now jump back across the gap and head north across the wooden 
plank, then climb up the ladder to a higher level. Climb up the next 
ladder to the top level. Proceed east across the top level and choose to 
jump into the water when prompted. You will now be in the interior area 
of the aqueduct as well as in the area where you are in while in Ryu's 
Dream. The dialogues are also exactly the same as last time you visit 
this place. Use the diary to rest and save if you need. 

Head west then north and finally east to reach a stair. Enter the first 
room before heading up a stair to collect a Life Shard from a item bag. 
The Life Shard will add 10 points to user's max HP BUT you should not 
use it yet. Don't forget that you still need to get 80 items to learn 
the first skill from Stoll. I suggest that you keep this first. Anyway, 
after taking it, head out of the room and head up the stair. In the next 
level, head out of the door, then down a stair and out of another door. 
You will reach the room leading to the room with the long set of 
curtains. Search the left shelf in this small room for a Magic Shard. 
Again, don't use it yet. Head out of this small room to reach the room 
with the long set of curtains. History will unfold itself again but with 
some differences this time. When you head out of this room, Lord Yuna 
and his servent will enter the room just like last time. Walk behind the 
curtain and when you enter the room on the other side, Yuna will 
teleport himself to stop your party. Nina and ask him about Elina and 
she will tell her what she knows about Elina. Before telling her more on 
the whereabouts of Elina, he sends a 'gang' of soldiers to capture your 
party. Your party will be toss back to the East Continent and Cray will 
be send for interrogation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryu awakes up with a yawn and Nina will enter to talk to him. Nina is 
worried about Cray who is still being questioned. Nina suggests going to 
the castle to meet Cray. Ryu, needless to say, will agree. Take the 
Aurum next to the bed with the Diary then use the Diary to save. After 
saving, try to exit the house. The 'dogger' will join up with you to 
prevent you from doing something 'funny'. Anyway, he is Scias, one of 
the people who will join you in this game. He uses swords just like Ryu. 
His initial sword can only be used by him so stop thinking of exchanging 
the swords. He also come armed with a Scale Plate which is better than 
Cuirass but let him equip the armor since he is on low level. Once 
outside of the house, you can head into the house next to the house you 
just came out from. There is a Manillo a.k.a orange frog who will sell 
you equipments and items. Buy the Katzbalger for Ryu is you want but i 
think Scramasax is still better. Anyway the choice is up to you. Buy the 
Reed Baton for Nina, she needs it. 

Now head to the castle. You will be stop by two guards and an old dwarf-
like person. Nina suggests to go to Worent, the hometown of Cray. Since 
you have no where to go, go to Worent! Head out of Ludia and you will be 
back on the world map. Once you reach the world map, two new routes will 
branch from Ludia. One leads you to Shyde and one leads you to Wychwood, 
your next destination. There is another fishing spot here. To find it, 
search for a '?' mark between the place marked with a '?' mark and 
Shyde. You will enter a vast area just like when you enter a random 
battleground. Search for a signboard. Read the signboard and exit west 
to arrive at the world map. A new route will lead you to a new fishing 
spot. This time, it is a ocean spot! Enter it if you want to fish. By 
the way, if you have fished rather oftenly, you should have at least 
2000 points already. After fishing, you do not have to hurry into the 
Wychwoods. Instead you are free to explore the world. There is a town 
called Shyde nearby.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can encounter random battles with Wyd and NutTroop. You can learn 
double blow from Nut Troop and you can gain lots of experience from Wyd. 
I suggest that you let Scias learn double blow. When he is using sword 
that hit twice, double blow will become triple blow! If you use fire 
spell on wyd, it will catch fire and change to firewyd. A Wyd gives you 
140 EXP but a Firewyd will give you 280 EXP! Please do not enter 
training mode yet as you are missing Cray. You will get him back soon. 
Anyway head into Shyde to do some buying.

The Blue Manillo near the entrance will trade your fishes for items. The 
Earth Claws, Broad Sword and Ruby Scepter are some weapons that you 
should try to trade. There is a man hidden behind the inn. You can find 
him hiding by the stair. He will trade a treasure with your lead ball. 
Trade with him and you'll get a Bronze Ball. Buy some long boots from 
the weapon dealer and some items from the item dealer. Once you are 
ready, its time to head for the Wychwoods. Head out of this town and 
head into Wychwoods.

Once in the woods, equip Nina with life Sandals. Head south then down 
the ramp. Continue south until you reach a fork. Take the west path and 
follow it to reach a chest with 3 Healing Herbs. Take them and return to 
the fork. Now take the north path and follow it as it turn to the west 
to reach the next area. 

In the next area, Nina will hear some sound. Everyone has some strange 
feeling about this place. As the party proceed, Nina will suddenly 
shrink to the size of a ant. A bird will arrive and collect her. You 
will now head on to look for her. Head south and you will have another 
sequence. Three faeries are discussing their evil plans when Ershin rams 
one down. Mortals cannot see the faeries but Ershin somehow process the 
power to see them. Anyway Ryu also has the power to see them because of 
the Dragon Eye. They will tell you that they have shrunk Nina and tell 
them that Nina was carried away by a bird. The bird has thought that 
Nina was a bird since she possesses a pair of wings. The faeries tell 
you to look for a tree with a bird in it before going off.

After the conversation, head west but do not go down the ramp. Jump 
across the gap and across another gap to get to a item bag with a Magic 
Shard. Now jump back and head down the ramp to the west. Proceed south 
west corner of this area and you will hear a bird singing. There is a 
tree nearby. Head up the ramp nearby then jump across the gap to reach 
the tree. Ram it with Ershin's field action and a bird will fly off. You 
will wake Nina up. She is surprise to be in a bird nest. You will now 
control her and she must descend down the tree. Head up the ramp and 
head anti-clockwise around the side of the nest. Jump when prompted. Now 
walk across the branch towards the trunk. The bird will return and Nina 
will run in the opposite direction. A c-c-c-caterpillarrrrr will drop 
onto the branch:) Nina will tell the bird that she is not her chicks and 
she do not like bugs. The bird will ignore what she says and attack!

Weakness: Wind
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Feeding Time: A Caterpillar falls from the sky and cause confusion.
Ponder      : 'Think' for a turn

Do not defeat this boss if you want a Bamboo Rod. Defeat this boss if 
you want the 250 EXP. To defeat it, use wind magic. I suggest that you 
do not defeat it so that you can get a Bamboo Rod. Keep guarding every 
turn and on the 9 - 10 turn, it will escape when it hear its chick 
calling. You will get no EXP and Zenny but will gain a Bamboo Rod!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the 'fight', proceed back to the branch on the other side to find 
a vine leading down. Climb it down and the screen will switch back to 
Ryu, Ershin and Scias. Ershin will ram the tree once more causing Nina 
to lose balance and fall. During the fall, Nina regains size and crushes 
Ryu when she lands. Now that you have Nina back, its time to head out of 
this forest. Head north and continue along the path and you will exit 
the Wychwood to arrive at the world map again. With the new bamboo rod, 
fishing has become a lot more easier. Don't believe me? Head into the 
Ocean Spot 1 armed with a bamboo rod and a Deep Driver and you will 
catch lots of Sea Bream! The Bamboo rod has good range but handle is a 
bit more difficult.

              Molotov [100Z], Water Bomb [100Z]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Take the route from Wychwood to Worent. This is the town of the tiger 
people. Everyone in this town has a tail just like Cray. Talk to the 
worens to know more about this town. There is a shop on the north side. 
The Orange Manillo inside will sell you equipments and items. Buy Ranger 
Garb for Ryu and Nina. Buy a few Water Bombs because you will need them 
soon. After buying the things you need, head into the big house on the 
eastern side. It is the cheif house. You will be greeted by three old 
worens once you are inside. One of the woren tells you to look for 
Tarhn, the mother of Cray. He says that Tarhn might have a solution. 
Tarhn, however have left the village when Cray becomes the Cheif. Now 
she lives on the Golden Plains. Ryu this time will give the suggestion. 
He suggests that the party head to the Golden Plains to find Tarhn. 
After the conversation, head into the south room and down the stair to 
reach a storage room. Get the Manly Clothes. Equip it on Ryu to raise 
his defense. Keep the Ranger Gard as you will need it soon. Note that 
the Manly Clothes will be destroyed once it revive the wearer once. 

After taking this valuable armor, head out of the house and down the 
stairs. Kahn, will drop down to stop you. Kahn has been miserable every 
minute of every day since you defeated him in Synesta. He has came to 
Worent to study under the worens longing to defeat you one day. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Kahn
Stats   :
HP: 3,600          EXP: 2,000           Zenny: 0        Spoils: Ginseng
Weakness: None
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Tiget Fist: 4-hit physical attack against everyone
Focus     : Increase attack power and counter-attack chance
Shout     : Stuns all character with some accuracy

Ignore every words he say because he is still as lousy as before. You 
can learn the focus skill from him if you have not done so in the 
previous match with him. He is a little resistance to Earth-based spells 
so refrain yourself from using Earth-based spells. His Tiger Fist is the 
only good move he has but do not worry about it. Kahn has just enough AP 
to use Tiger Fist only once:) Have Scias use Shining Blade, Ryu use Burn 
and Nina use Cyclone. Ershin isn't useful in this fight so keep him in 
the back. You should kill him on the third round. You will receive a 
Ginseng after the fight. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the fight, Kahn's master, Una will approach him. Una scold your 
party for 'picking' on Kahn. Back at Una's room, Una will discipline 
Kahn. Head back into the cheif's house and climb the ladder on the wall 
to reach Una's room. Talk to her and she will tell you that Kahn has 
left and she blame your party. Tell her that you are sorry and she will 
train you instead. Ershin is the perfect choice to be her apprentice 
since Ershin is already useless in magic so why not let her be a good 
fighter. DO NOT make Scias her apprentice because Scias does not have 
high AP and making Scias her apprentice will cause Scias to gain little 
AP when leveling up. Trust me, you'll need Scias's AP to make him a good 
fighter. She will then tell you to return when you have done a combo 
that deal at least 1,500 damage. I think by now you should have done 
more than 3,500 damage using combos. Talk to her and she will teach you 
Pilfer, a skill that allows you to steal while attacking. Let Nina learn 
the skill since high agility somehow increase the chance of stealing 
items. If you have deal more than 3,000 damage using combos, you can 
learn super combo from her. Let Scias learn the skill. The third skill 
will require you to deal at least 10,000 damage using combos. Needless 
to say, you won't be getting the third skill for sometimes. 

Head down and talk to the three elders. One of them will tell you to get 
a horse. Head out of the Cheif's house and head into the house near the 
entrance with the water wheel. The puppeteer is inside. She will teach 
you more about battle. You will learn from her that there are some 
enemies that 'change'. They are Wyds and Drakes. When you use a fire 
spell on them, they will become more powerful and when you defeat them, 
you will gain more EXP. Of course there are more monsters that will 
change when certain conditions are met. 

Now its time to get a horse and head to the Golden Plains. Talk to the 
man beside the Stables and he will pick a horse for you. However, no one 
knows how to ride a horse! Then the strange shell creature will start 
chasing Ershin in circles. Nina asks the man whether they can take the 
Whelk. The man reluctantly agrees and tell you that Tarhn's camp is 
somewhere in the northeast and the clue is to look out for the smoke 
from her campfire. Talk to the man again and he will tell you more. He 
tells you to head east once you get to the Plains. When you come to the 
big rock, turn towards the northeast to find Tarhn's camp. Sounds easy 
right? Actually it is a lot more harder... Now head out of Worent.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a camp to restand save before going anywhere. Now make sure that 
Ryu has some magic so that he can use them against those 'Nuts' family 
in Golden Plains. If you have followed my walkthrough, Ryu should have 
Burn and Eddy. Anyway when you are ready, enter the Golden Plains. 

Once you are in the Golden Plains, your party will leave you and you 
will head off to find Tarhn's Camp alone. Ryu fails to ride the Whelk in 
the first time but gain confidence from his friends. 

The plains is in first-person view and you will have the full control of 
the camera. You start off facing east which is the right direction. 
Press up on the directional pad and you will head east. THe left and 
right button on the directional pad will rotate the camera. Anyway head 
east for a few minutes until you reach the big rock. You will get into 
random battles on the way. When fighting the nuts, use Burn or Molotov 
to kill them easily. When you are near the big rock, a bird will follow 
you. When you reach the rock, the bird will land on the rock. Turn 45 
degrees to the left and you will be now facing northeast. If you are 
cannot get the direction right, wait by the rock for a while until the 
bird flies off. It will be heading in the northeast direction, Follow it 
and you will reach Tarhn's camp. It's actually not that hard... Just 
rotate the camera until the compass needle becomes like '\' with the red 
part at the top. Then hold up button and you will reach Tarhn's Camp in 
a few minutes time. 

While heading northeast, you will pass by a few rocks. When you see 
them, keep in mind that you are getting close to Tarhn's camp. Now look 
out for smoke while continue heading northeast. After a few minutes, you 
should see Tarhn's camp. 

You will meet Tarhn. Ryu's will tell her everything. After the short 
conversation, it is night time already. Tarhn will offer Ryu to stay up 
the night and think of a solution tomorrow. Head inside the tent and 
rest. By the way, Tarhn doesn't have a tail meaning she is not a woren. 
Don't ask me why Cray has a tail, i do not know the answer. 

The screen will now switch to Cray who is now being interrogated by the 
judge. Cray is charged for sneaking into the empire and to worsen the 
matter, the King's Sword is broken. The King's Sword is the symbol of 
the Alliance. Cray tries to argue but was in vain. Now you will have a 
flashback on what happened during the arguement with Rasso. After the 
flashback, the screen will return to Ryu.

Head out of the tent then talk to Tarhn. Choose to tell he about the 
King's Sword. Tarhn tells you that the King's Sword is a symbol of 
Alliance and losing it is a grave mistake. Tarhn says that if the sword 
is returned, then Cray will not be in that much of trouble. She will 
tell you that a smith living in a volcano called Mt.Glom can make 
another copy of the King's Sword. She tells you to return to Worent and 
get information on how to get to the volcano. Head out of this area and 
you will be back on the world map. Head along the route and you will be 
stop by a exclaimation mark. Enter to find your party. Exit this area 
and choose to leave the plains. You will be back on the world map.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Head back to Worent and talk to the three elders. One of them will tell 
you how to get to Mt. Glom. He tells you to head east over the plains 
then when you reach the large rock, turn to the south and you will see a 
mountain with a plume of smoke coming out of it. It is Mt. Glom. Now 
head to the world map. Equip Ryu, Scias and Nina with Ranger Grabs. Also 
equip Nina with the Reed Baton. The Ruby Scepter is fire-based and will 
heal the monsters in Mt. Glom so it is not a good weapon to use. Then 
head into the plains again. 

Once in the plains, head east until you reach the big rock. You'll have 
to get there by foot. After a few minutes, you will reach the big rock. 
Now look to the south to find a mountain with smoke coming out. Head 
south towards the mountain. After a few minutes, you will reach the edge 
of the plains. Exit the plains to reach Mt. Glom. 

Enter the hole to reach the interior of the Volcano. Remember those 
Water Bombs that i called you to buy in Worent? Now its the time to use 
them. The monsters in Mt. Glom are weak against water spells so use 
Water Bomb to kill them easily. Once inside, head east, avoiding 
stepping onto the lava. If you happen to step on the lava, you will take 
damage. Jump across the gap and across another gap, then head into the 
next area. In the next area, head west into a hole. Get the Fire Ward 
and return to the previous area. Go up the ramp on the east and head 
into the next area through the hole. You will reach a lava-filled room. 
After the first random encounter in this area, the platforms will drift 
and will return to their original locations after the second encounter. 
Get into a random battle near the entrance. After the fight, the 
platforms will drift. Move to the east platform and open the chest to 
get 600 Z. Now head to the centre platform and get into a battle. After 
the battle, the platforms will move back to the original locations. 
Cross to the north platform and get into another fight. Now cross over 
to the platform with the chest containing two vitamins. After taking it, 
cross back to the previous platform, then cross north east to the other 
side. Ignore the exit, head north to another platform. Now get into a 
fight on this platform. The platforms will shift again. Cross to the 
platform on the west than get into another battle. After the battle, the 
platforms will shift again. Now head through the hole on the west into a 
cave. Get a Drill Punch from the chest. Equip it on Ershin. After taking 
it, head back out. Head back to the exit i mentioned above. Exit this 
area through the exit. 

In the next area, climb down the ladder. Head west across the bridge and 
continue across two more bridges and you will arrive outside the smith 
house. Head into the house to find a dwarf. He is the smith. He will 
tell you that he cannot forge a King's Sword without Faerie Drop, a rare 
metal which is believed to be possessed only by faeries. He tells you to 
come back after getting a Faerie Drop. Climb down the ladder in the 
smith house then exit to the west. Now cross the bridge at the north and 
cross another bridge to get to a platform with 4 Molotovs in the chest. 
Now head back across the two bridges and into the level below smith 
house. Head east out of this area, then follow the path to reach the 
entrance of Mt. Glom. Head out of Mt. Glom and you will arrive on the 
world map. Now set up a camp to rest and save the game. I'm sure your 
party isn't in the top condition after going through Mt. Glom. 

After saving, head back into Wychwood. Once in the Wychwood, you will 
hear those faeries laughing. From where you are, head south and jump 
across the gap to the small circular platform. Head east then up a ramp. 
You should see some colorful lights. Examine them and a faery will 
appear. Then the other two faery will arrive. Ryu asks them about the 
Faerie Drop but they doesn't have any. They 'invite' you to come to 
where they lives to get a Faerie Drop. They will drop some heavy items 
onto the heads of your party. Off you go... to their homeland...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside, the faeries will tell you that they used to live in the land of 
dreams. However they are driven out by a group of monsters. They promise 
to give you a Faerie Drop if you promise to drive the monsters out of 
the land of dreams. 

After the conversation, head north and you will see a 'ZZZ' sign. It it 
where the 'meanies' are hiding. Examine the 'ZZZ' spot near the 
signboard to fight Nmago. Nmago counters a lot but physical attacks will 
kill it easily. After defeating it, examine the 'ZZZ' spot to the right. 
You will fight Chkom. Chkom can cast sleep on your entire party but he 
isn't tough. Using physical attacks will kill it easily too. After 
defeating it, examine another 'ZZZ' spot to the west and you will fight 
Kyo. This ghost likes to use spells that will lower your stats but you 
can kill it easily with physical attacks. After defeating it, head north 
and examine the 'ZZZ' spot behind the tree. You will fight Udy. Udy 
evades physical attacks a LOT so use magic to kill it. You might get a 
Life Shard for defeating Udy. After defeating Udy, north and examine the 
last 'ZZZ' spot. You will fight Bokta, the last of the five ghosts. Use 
physical attacks to kill it. After defeating Bokta, the boss will show 
up. Before approaching it, heal your party.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss Fight: Fantam
Stats   :
HP: 5,000       EXP: 4,000       Zenny: 1,800       Spoils: Magic Shard
Weakness: None
Strength: Earth  
Attacks :
Drain    : Drains target's HP
Sever    : Weak Wind-based spell against one target
Frost    : Weak Water-based spell against one target
Ovum     : Turn all targets into eggs
Nose Dive: Physical attack against everyone

This boss comes in foir sizes. He will grow or shrink depending on the 
types of damage he receive. Physical attacks make him bigger while 
magical attacks make him smaller. In bigger size, he is stronger against 
physical attacks but weaker against magical attacks. In smaller size, he 
is weaker against physical attacks but stronger against magical attacks. 
Use combos to shrink him to the smallest size. Then on the next round 
have all character pound him with physical attacks. When he uses Ovum, 
there is a chance that everyone will turn into eggs. When in egg form, 
attack power will fall, defense will GREATLY fall and items are not 
usable. When a character is in egg form, shift him/her to the back row. 
There is a very GOOD tactic against this boss. Have Ryu cast burn 
followed by Nina casting Cyclone/Sever, then have Scias use super combo. 
The two spells wil cause the boss to shrink to the smallest size. Now 
comes the super combo. Try to get as many hits as possible for the super 
combo. Each hit from the super combo will deal 220+ damage. HAHA! He 
will go down very fast! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating Fantam, it will shrink to the size of nothing. The 
faeries will thank you and hand over the Faerie 'Drop' to you. I wonder 
how did a faery with a size so small lay a Sh*t with a size so big? 
After getting the Faerie Drop, the Faery will send you back to the 
homeworld. Now head out of Wychwood and you will be back on the world 
map. Set up a camp to rest and save.  

After saving, head to the smith's house west of Mt. Glom. With the raw 
material ready, the smith will forge a King's Sword for you. In the next 
morning the replacement sword will be done. Now head back to the world 
map and enter Ludia. Once you are in Ludia, head into the castle. Before 
Nina is able to lie to them that the King's Sword has been found, the 
judge tell them that it was just returned to them by the Empire. So you 
went through everything and finally got the replacement King's Sword and 
now the sword has been found?!!! It seems that the Empire returned the 
sword to Ludia on some conditions... He tells you that Cray will not 
receive light sentence before sending you out of the castle. Outside the 
castle, Nina plans to raid the castle at night. Now head back to the 
town section and enter your room.  Choose to wait for nightfall in the 
room.

Now the screen will switch to Fou-Lu who was injured once again. After a 
short conversation, the screen will switch back to Ryu.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Diary to save first. Head back into the castle. Once in the 
castle, approach the guard. You only have 1 turn before the guards call 
for help. Use Combo attacks to defeat them quickly. If you fail to 
defeat him in the first turn, you will be toss out of the castle and 
will have to try again. After defeating him, head into the room that he 
was guarding. Proceed up the stairs and defeat another guard. Note that 
you can pilfer a Steel BPlate from the guards. After defeating the 
guard, head into the room he was guarding to find a chest containing a 
Artemis' Cap. This accessory is not as good as the long boots so don't 
bother equiping it. After taking it, head out of the room and continue 
up the stairs to the next level. In the next level, continue along the 
corridor and enter the next room. Head up the stairs into the next room, 
then defeat the guard. After defeating the guard, your party will 
automatically enter the room that the guard was guarding. You will find 
Cray inside. After Cray rejoins you, back-track to the first floor and 
exit the castle. Now search the Ludia Town for a man outside a house at 
the south. He will upgrade the Bronze Ball to a Lead Ball. Now head out 
of Ludia and enter Worent. 

Once you are in Worent, upgrade Cray's equipment. Head into the Elders 
house and talk to the elders. They will tell you to talk to Tarhn again. 
Now head out of Worent and head into Tarhn's Campsite. You will spend 
the night in Tarhn's camp. In the morning, speak with Tarhn. Nina will 
tells everyone that the Empire might be looking for Ryu. Now think back, 
in Sarai when you first met Rasso, he said he was looking for a dragon. 
Ryu must be associated with Dragons since he has caused a violent 
reaction in the Mud Dragon and that he possesses a dragon eye. Nina will 
make another suggestion again. She suggests going to the Dragon Shrine 
in Wyndia to meet the Wind Dragon. He might be able to tell the answer 
to Ryu's mystery. Tarhn will then hand a Jadestone to Cray. You can use 
the jadestone to get through the ruins to Wyndia. Talk to Tarhn again to 
find out that the ruins are to the east of the campsite. Now head out of 
the campsite to arrive back on the world map. 
Head into the plains and head east once you are inside. Continue east 
past the big rock until you head out from the edge. You will reach the 
ruins once you exit the plains.

Enter the ruins, then head west and place the jadestone onto the 
offering table. The statue behind will descend, revealing a entrance. 
Head inside and head east across the narrow path to reach a fork. Take 
the north path and continue along it, passing the first intersection and 
taking the west path when you reach another intersection. Open the chest 
to get 500 Z. Head east back to the intersection and continue east, 
ignoring the crossroad and head south when you reach a fork with two new 
paths. Continue along the path as it turns to the west. Enter the next 
area. In the next area, put Cray as the first person as he is needed to 
solve the puzzle. You will see a lot of laser emitters. Do NOT touch any 
of the lasers as they will hurt you a little. First head down the stairs 
and push the green laser emitter once. Head west a little then north to 
reach the yellow laser emitter. Push it once and head back up the 
stairs. Head south and down another stairs. You will now be in between 
the yellow laser and a red laser. Head north then east, then south and 
up the stairs to reach a chest with 4 Silver Tops. Head down the stairs 
and head back north a little to reach a red laser emitter. Push it once 
anti-clockwise. Now head west to reach the yellow laser emitter again. 
Push the yellow laser emitter anti-clockwise once. Now head south to the 
green laser emitter near the stairs. Push it clockwise once. Now head 
west then north to return to the red laser emitter. Push the red laser 
emitter clockwise once and you can now head into the east room! Enter 
the east room to find a chest with a Light Bangle. After taking the 
Light Bangle, head back outside. 

Push the red laser emitter to the anti-clockwise once. Now head to the 
green laser emitter and push it anti-clockwise once. Now head to the 
yellow laser emitter and push it clockwise once. Now head back up the 
stairs at the west to reach the upper section. Head north and down the 
next stairs. Move east along the green laser and and enter the north 
doorway. In the next area, head up the stairs to the next area. You will 
arrive at a place that looked like a house. There is a guy at the west 
side of this building. He is interested to trade the Iron Ball of yours. 
He will take the Iron Ball and gives you a Brass Ball. After trading, 
exit the building and search for a chest at the back of the building. 
The chest contains 2 Ammonias. There's nothing else to get, so head out 
of this area to arrive at the world map again. Set up a camp to rest and 
save if you need.

Before heading into Ahm Fen, be sure to get into some random battles 
along the route between the shrine and Ahm Fen. The random items found 
along this part of the route are ALL items that inflict status effects 
like muting, poison and etc. Get some of the items and head into Ahm Fen 
when you think you have enough. 

When you are in Ahm Fen, head across the wooden bridge to the circular 
platform. There is a sign board there. Read it if you want. It tells 
that stepping on a part of the walkway that's been repaired will make a 
loud noise, which could frighten some of the animals in the Swamp and 
please walk quietly. Head south across the wooden bridge then south 
again across another bridge to get to a platform with a place to jump. 
Ignore the treasure chest at the south, you will get it soon. Jump 
across the gap to reach another platform. Head your way across the 
sections of wooden planks to the west by jumping across the gaps when 
prompted. When you reach the platform, head down the ramp to the west 
and continue west across the waterlogged area to get to the chest that 
you see earlier on. It contains Baby Frog. After taking it, head back to 
the ramp and proceed south east to reach another ramp. Head up the ramp 
follow the bridge to the next area. 

In the next area, continue east along the bridge until you reach a fork. 
Head across the north east path and you will see a large snake. Stepping 
onto the 'X' part of the bridge will produce some noise which will wake 
the snake up. The snake will move a little. Now head south and step onto 
its body. Head across its body and onto another wooden bridge. Purposely 
step onto another repaired part to make some noise. The snake will move 
again. Now alk across the snake again to the next platform. Step onto 
another repaired part and it will move again. Do not step onto its body 
first. Head to the south to find a chest with a Scale Mail. Equip it on 
Ryu. Head back onto the bridge and remember the snake's position. As you 
step onto the repaired part, it will move again meaning you cannot cross 
anymore. Step onto the repaired part for a few times and he will return 
to the position. Now head across the snake's body to reach the next 
platform. Take the ramp down to the waterlogged area. Head northeast and 
up a ramp. Step onto the repaired part for a few times until the snake's 
neck part join to the south part of this platform. Step onto the snake 
proceed to the platform on the west. Step on the repaired part a few 
times until it no longer blocks the chest. When the snakes is out of the 
way, moves down the ramp and open the chest for 3 Life Shards. Head back 
up the ramp and step onto the repaired part once more. Head across the 
snake and get onto the platform on the south. Head across the bridge, 
ignoring the snake as it moves in respond to the sound. Head east out of 
this area to reach the next area. In the next area, continue your way 
out and you will arrive on the world map again. Now head your way to 
Wyndia at the north. Along the route, you will be stop by a '!' mark. 
Enter the area and your party will set up a camp to rest as well as 
chat. During the conversation, a faery from Wychwood will arrive. You 
want Ryu to help them. It seems that the faeries have been gone from 
their homes so long that they have no idea where to start rebuilding 
from. Agree to help them and you will now be able to play the 'Faerie 
Colony' Game. Refer to section 4, part v for more information on 'Faerie 
Colony'. You can also visit the smith house in Mt. Glom to make some 
armors for Ershin if you want. The is a house marked with a '?' mark 
east of Ahm Fen. Enter it and enter the house. You can find a married 
faerie and a human inside. Search the cabinet for a Vigor Seed. Proceed 
upstairs and you will find Njomo who is one of the master. After you 
have managed the Faerie Colony for some time, she will be your master. 
Ignore her for now as she will now be your master yet. Proceed all the 
way north into Wyndia when you are ready.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wyndia is the hometown of all winged people. Directly west of the 
entrance is a Manillo Trading Shop. He has some great lures. Exchange 
them if you need. You can also increase the number of stamp cards at the 
same time. The first house by the entrance is a Inn as well as a shop. 
Enter it and buy some new equipments. Buy the bastard Sword for Ryu, 
Wand of Air for Nina, Mace for Cray, Biter for Scias and Mage's 
Robes/Party Dress for Nina. The building bext to the Inn is a Windmill. 
You will find a new master inside. She is Momo. Scias is a good choice 
to be her apprentice. You can learn Spray from her if your gametime is 
more than 25 hours. Give the spray skill to Ershin, she will benefit a 
lot out of it. If you have more than 30 hours on the clock, you can 
learn Clip from her. Clip uses agility as attack. Give it to Nina. I 
think most of you should not be able to learn the third skill from her 
at this point.

Exit the Windmill after you have had enough with Momo. Enter the first 
house right of the entrance and search the cabinet for 6 apples. The 
next right building is a huge mansion with a lot of goodies. Inside, 
head into the west room and search the north cupboard for 2 Fish Heads 
and search the south cabinet for 2 Swallow Eyes. The south door takes 
you to the dining room. The frogman will tell you that their Chopsticks, 
Spoons, Forks, Toothpicks and Straws are missing. If you talk to the 
waiter in black, he will ask for those silverware. He will give you some 
Aurums in exchange for them. Exchange with him if you need. He will give 
you 1 Aurum for a toothpick, 2 Aurums for a pair of chopsticks, 4 Aurums 
for a Straw, 8 Aurums for a Spoon and 16 Aurums for a Fork. You will get 
no prizes for giving him all the five silverwares. Now that you have 
completely looted the house, exit the house. The third right house from 
the entrance has another goody. Search the cabinet for a Eye Drops. 

Now you have looted the town, its time to loot the castle! At the far 
east side of the town is a lift that will take you into the castle. 
After you arrive at the castle, walk east from the lift and enter the 
Windmill. Head up the stairs into the next level. Head out and you will 
be at the top of the castle. Head north and enter another room. Get a 
Ring of Wind from the chest. Now head back to the lower floor and out of 
the Windmill. Head north to enter the castle. Talk to the guards with 
Nina and they will allow you to pass. The first south room has a Wisdom 
Fruit in the cabinet and the second south room has a Soul Gem in the 
cabinet. Now head to the northeast corner and talk to the guard in 
black. He will invite you in to meet the King. The King assures Cray 
safety and Nina tells him that they want to meet the Wind Dragon. He 
will tell you that P'ung Ryong, the Wind Dragon is the patron god and 
protector of Wyndians. The king will tell you to go to the woods east of 
Wyndia to find the Oracle of Wind, the priestess who serves the Wind 
Dragon. Your party will rest up and in the morning, search the cabinet 
in the King's room for a Fat Frog.

Head down the central staircase, then arrive back outside through the 
west door. Head north and enter the room to reach a underground area. 
Head down the stairs into the next area. Talk to the man in the cell to 
trade treasure with him. Now you can heard back to town and prepare 
yourself for the next trip.

Skills      :
    Risky Blow    -->  BeeTroop
    Last Resort   -->  Bilboa
    Mind Flay     -->  Cracker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can learn Last Resort from Bilboa. They usually use it on the second 
turn. You can also learn the Risky Blow from BeeTroops. They will use it 
once their shield is broken. 

At the first screen of the Woods, head west and cross the bridge. On the 
other side, head south to find a fisherman. He will tell you a new 
fishing spot. After talking to him, you can head out of the woods and go 
fishing. When you are ready to proceed, head north from the bridge on 
the first screen to the next area. In the next area, cross the log to 
the east, then continue east on the path to reach a chest with 600 
Zenny. After taking the money, head back to the log and cross it. Now 
head all the way north to reach a broken bridge. Ignore the treasure 
chest on the other side because you can't get it from here. Head 
southeast from the bridge and cross another bridge. Ignore the item bag 
near the bridge because you can't get it yet. Now head north to reach a 
signboard and a log. Read the sign to know how to 'ride' the log.

First, move in front of a log and press one of the directional buttons. 
Once you've stepped on a log, use the directional buttons to move it. 
However, you cannot move against the grain of the log. You can move off 
the log you are on when it touches another log or the ground. Now that 
you know the instruction, its time for you to 'ride' the logs! 

First hop onto the first log, then roll north to the next log. Cross 
over to the second log, then roll it to the west. Hop off the second log 
and onto the platform. Head south and hop onto another log. Roll this 
log to the south and get the item bag which contains 2 Weather Vane. Now 
roll the log back to the platform, then roll the second log to the next 
log. Roll the log all the way north and jump off the log to  the ground. 
Head west up the slope, then head south and continue along the path to 
reach the treasure chest you saw earlier. Take the Long Boots from the 
chest. After taking it, head back to the log and hop onto it. Roll the 
log to the south and hop off the log to the west platform. Hop onto the 
north log which is perpendicular to the log you just hopped off. Roll 
the log east, then cross to the next log. Roll the log all the way 
north, then hop off and onto the ground again. Now head east and up a 
slope, then head north to reach the next area.

In the next area, head west and follow the path, avoiding the plants 
with thorns. If you happens to step on one, you will take little damage. 
You will reach a treasure chest with a Magic Shard at the end. Now head 
back to this area's entrance. Head along the east path and continue 
along the path and you will reach the next area. In the next area, 
continue north to reach the Oracle's house. Enter the house and a 
conversation will automatically occurs. The Oracle of Wind will tell to 
get the Wind Flute from below the Wyndia Castle. With the Wind Flute, 
your party will be able to enter the Tower of Wind. When you control Ryu 
again, search the bookshelf for 3 Flattops and open the treasure chest 
for a Aurum. There is nothing more in this house so head out of this 
house. Head east and out of the area to arrive at the world map again. 
Your party will automatically set up a camp. Nina notices that Scias is 
missing and Cray believes that he has gone off to inform the Ludians 
that what we are planning to do since he was paid by the Ludian to watch 
over your party. 

After the conversation, your party will automatically be on the world 
map. You should visit the Faerie Colony now for a while because there 
should be 2-3 newborns now! You can also head to Njomo house and talk to 
her. It should be time that she will become your master. Under her 
teaching, Nina can become a good magic user so make Nina her apprentice. 
Once you have 8 faeries in the colony, you can learn the first skill 
from her. When you are ready, re-enter Wyndia.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you are in Wyndia, enter the castle and talk to the King who is in 
the throne room. He will give you the permission to take the Wind Flute 
who is kept beneath the Castle. After the conversation, head out of the 
throne room and head through the north door. Enter the north windmill 
and head down the stairs. Head down the next stair into the next area. 
The guard will stand aside and you may enter the basement. 

Go through the doorway then down the wide stairs and through the next 
doorway. You will now reach a underground area. Head east until you 
reach a fork with a turning fan. Ignore the south path because it will 
lead you to a dead end. Take the north path and continue along it until 
you reach another fork with another fan. Take the northeast path to 
reach a chest with a Soul Gem. Return to the second fork and take the 
south path. After a few steps you will reach another fork with yet 
another fan. Head northeast, along the path and under a arch until you 
reach the next screen.

In the next area, head on the path until you reach another fork, again 
with another fan. This fan is different from the other fan. It will 
hinder your movement. When walk in the direction that it is blowing, you 
will be drawn back. When it faces north, quickly proceed through the 
northeast path to reach a treasure chest with 3 Swallow Eyes. After 
taking it, you should automatically be drawn back to the fork. Now wait 
your chance to run through the north passage. Enter through the doorway 
at the end to reach the next area. 

In the next area, proceed north to find a rotating platform. When the 
platform reaches where you are, walk onto it and wait for it to face 
north. Once it faces north, walk off to the ledge. Head east and walk 
onto the next plaform. Now wait for it to become join up with a wooden 
ledge at the south. Open the chest to get a Balance Ring. The Balance 
Ring protects the wearer against confusion. You might want to equip it 
on someone since there are some monsters in here who are capable of 
confusing people. After taking it, walk back onto the platform. Wait for 
it to link up with the platform on the east. Now wait for this platform 
to link up with the east ledge. Walk off the platform when it linked 
with the east ledge. Head through the doorway into the next area. 

In the next area, proceed along the path to find more fans. These fans 
will also drawn you back if you head in its direction. When the wind 
stop, hide in the cavities in the wall. When the wind stop, head north 
through the passage and hide in the cavities on the right. Wait for the 
wind to stop once more, then continue along the path and hiding in 
cavities at the same time. Do not miss 4 Healing Herbs and 2 
FlashGrenades along the way. Now continue to be careful and enter the 
next area. 

In the next area, head north and you will find the Wind Flute. No it is 
time to head out of this underground dungeon but you might one to pilfer 
a fighting robe off some ZombieDrs. When you are ready, head your way 
out of this underground place. Once you are back in the castle, you will 
get a sequence. Scias is really back in Ludia, informing the group of 
ugly old men about the Wind Dragon. The 'main' old man known as Master 
IIgor gives Scias the money he deserves before mentioning about some 
plan of his. AWWW!! This damn Scias, son of a bi**h really loves money. 
Master Ilgor intends to capture Ryu before the Empire. Now the screen 
will switch back to Ryu's group. Now head out of Wyndia. You might want 
to visit your cute little creatures in their Colony. There should be one 
of two new faeries. Assign them to work and head into Pung'tap where the 
Wind Dragon is. Take note that this is the last change to finish your 
business on this region. Once you proceed past Pung'tap, you cannot 
return to this region until sometime later. When you are absolutely sure 
that you are done with this region, head into Pung'tap.

      Drakes.

When you are in Pung'tap, Nina will automatically blow the wind flute, 
activating the path to Pung'tap. Head up the stairs and enter the 
doorway into Pung'tap. Head down the next stairs and continue your way 
into the next area. There are two new doorways in the next area. Enter 
the south doorway and follow the passage until you get to room with a 
treasure chest containing a Hombing Bomb. Take the treasure and head 
back to the room with the three doors. Equip the Homing Bomb on Ershin, 
then head through the north doorway. In the next area, continue along 
the passage, then up a stairs and through another doorway into the next 
area.

The next area is a place with strong winds blowing. When you first enter 
the area, you will be taught how to get past this area. Jump off the 
platform in time with the wind to move to another platform. Stand on the 
edge of a platform and press right or left to jump. Wait for the wind to 
calm down, then jump over to the platform to the south. Now jump off 
this platform when the wind is blowing and you will be send to the 
platform above. Open the chest for 600 Zenny. Now head back down the the 
very first platform. Wait for the wind to blow again, then jump off and 
you will fly off to a platform with a doorway. Head out of this area 
through the doorway. Head up the spiraling stairs around the tower and 
enter the tower through the doorway at the top. 

You will be back in a windy area. Wait for the wind to blow, then jump 
off and you will 'fly' to the next screen. Now jump to the next platform 
with the help of the wind, then make your way to the ledge at the top. 
Jump when the wind is blowing and you will be send flying into the next 
screen. Open the chest for a fighting robe, then jump off the ledge with 
the wind blowing and you will be send to the top of the tower. Jump back 
into the hole and you will land on another ledge. Jump down and you will 
land on a platform with a chest containing 2 power foods. Now head back 
up to the top of the tower. 

Head out of the tower and a conversation will take place. Nina tells you 
that the winged gondola can take them even higher. After the short 
conversation, head south across the narrow wooden beam to the winged 
gondola. Master Ilgor will arrive before you can use the gondola. The 
old man will tell you that Ryu is the Yorae Dragon and commands your 
party to exchange Ryu for their lifes. Then three 'supporting' old man 
will arrive and Ilgor sends them to fight your party. Physical attacks 
is enough for these three useless creatures. These creatures has some 
annoying status attacks so finish them off before they do any great harm 
to your party. After killing them, Ilgor will send out three more 
Grunts. Scias will also show up. Scias wants to break his contract with 
Ilgor. Furiously, Ilgor sends his dolls to attack your party again. 
Scias will be included in this battle but he is not under your command. 
If you use any spells that hurt every enemies, Scias will also get hurt, 
so avoid using multi-targetting spell. Don't worry, Scias will be on 
your side. Scias will also heal your party in this battle. After the 
battle, Ilgor will run off and Scias will re-join your party. 

After the conversation, your party will automatically take the Gondola. 
Now you will be above the clouds. You will see P'ung Ryong, the Wind 
Dragon. He will too tell you that Ryu is the Yorae Dragon. He will 
transform into a much smaller form so that his voice would cause the 
gondola to shake. He will mention that Ryu is one of the Endless. He 
will tell you more about Ryu's background and purpose on earth. Take 
note about the part about Ryu being incomplete. P'ung Ryong will take 
you to a mountain in the centre of the continent. He tells you to head 
to the village at the foot of the mountain, because they will tell you 
more about Ryu. When you control Ryu, head down the mountain and you 
will be back on the world map.

Before heading into Chek, get into some random encounters on the world 
map. Be sure to fight some Blue Balls. If you use any water spell on 
them, they will start using Frost Strike which can be learnt. Try to 
learn this useful skills. When you are done, head into Chek. 

When you first enter Chek, you will see a LOT of small childrens. These 
are not ordinary children, they are children with incredible knowledge.

weapon/item shop. You will meet the Abbess inside. She will too call you 
the Yorae Dragon. She talks about some nonsensical things but will 
explain them to you. She mentions that everyone has a powerful force 
within them. Those who attuned to it can see it. To the people with high 
wisdom, it looks like a pillar of shining light. The color, size and 
appearance of the force in each person is different. Well, Nina is 
yellow, Cray is green and Ryu is blue. So gods are define as people who 
can affects the stream of others:) Your party will rest and Ryu wakes up

    Ebonfire      -->  Gulper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can learn the powerful Ebonfire skill from the Gulpers. To get them 
to use it, you will have to supply them with the AP they need. They have 
no AP at the beginning of the battle. Use a wisdom seed on one of them 
and they will start using spells. If you are lucky, Ebonfire will be 
used in the first or second turn. These Gulpers have a lot of third 
level spells and can deal around 500-600 HP damage. They even know how 
to cast Death.

At the first screen, follow the path to the top, then jump over the gap 
to the other side. Jump across a few more gaps, then continue south and 
jump across another gap to get to a platform with a chest. Open the 
treasure chest for a Water Ward. After taking it, jump back and head 
north and continue along the path. Jump across more gaps and continue 
your way to reach the next area.

In the next area, jump across more gaps until you reach a rotating 
platform. Examine the white crystal nearby to stop it. You must time it 
right so that you can get onto it. Even if you get onto it, you might 
get to a dead end. When this happens, try again until you can get to the 
top of the rotating platform. When you get to the top, examine the green 
crystal to meet the trapped Ershin. She is sealed by the four pillars, 
so to release her, you will have to defeat the four pillars.

Rock Blast  : Level 1 Earth-based spell against all targets
Stone Pillar: Level 2 Earth-based spell against one target 

Burn and Flame Strike should be used against this pillar. Do not turn 
into the Aura dragon, thinking that Hwa can kill this pillar faster. 
Don't waste the turn, just keep Ryu in human form.

Attacks :
Flare    : Level 1 Fire-based spell against one target
FireBlast: Level 2 Fire-based spell against all targets 

Sever and Eddy destroys this pillar. Throw all the single-targeting wind 
spell at him and he will go down fast. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After defeating all pillars, you will get 10000 EXP and 8 items! Ershin 
will also be free. Ershin will tell you that she has no body meaning 
that she cannot leave the armor. He ask you to help her get a body for 
her by finding a medium. Now head back to the platform with the chest 
and jump off the platform across the west gap. You will be at the 
entrance. Head out to be back in reality again. 

The Abbess has already called for a medium and she is Rhem, the 
strongest medium in the village. Ershin will be transferred to the 
medium and leaving my expensive suit of armor behind:( The switch will 
tehn switched to Mami and Fou-Lu for a short scene. When you control 
Ryu's group again, head into the Abbess's house. Ershin will be finished 
with eating. She will tell you that Ryu and she are Endless.
Ryu and Ershin are both summoned by the Fou Empire but with the wrong 
methods. That is why they are incomplete. Ershin was sealed in the Armor 
and Ryu was split into two. 

After the conversation, the screen will switch to Fou-Lu. Before heading 
out of the house, use the diary to save. Head out of the house and you 
will find yourself in a village. Now try to exit the town. A man will 
stop you. Mami arrived in time to save you from listening to the 
nonsenses he is saying. After the conversation, you will be switched to 
Ryu again. The conversation continues. Ryu and his other half are 
seperate by both time and distance. Ershin tells you that Ryu's other 
half is Fou-Lu, the person who you has been controlling once in a while.

After hearing the shocking news, the screen will switch back to Fou-Lu. 
Surprisely, Fou-Lu will tell Mami his own story. Mami tells Fou-Lu that 
she is sad to see him being so sad and the screen will fades out, with 
the resting music. 

In the next morning, you will control Fou-Lu. Head out of the house and 
head to the place where the landlord stopped you earlier on. Head down 
the path to reach the next screen. Continue on the path and you will 
meet Mami. During the conversation, you will see a lot of harsh words 
said by Fou-Lu. Suddenly you will hear a roar. Head across the bridge to 
the south, then continue along the path and enter the forest to the 
east. Continue along the path through the forest and you will arrive at 
a clearing. At the clearing, all the animals will run off and a huge 
mammoth will drop from the sky, almost smashing Fou-Lu.

This battle is a waste of time, it is very easy. Have Fou-Lu turn into 
the Astral Dragon, then pound him with a few Erasers and he will be 
defeated. Papan will shrink and turn into a boar after you defeat him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now head back to the village and Mami will come running in. The screen 
will switch back to Ryu's group.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your party cannot figure out anything more beside Ryu's other half being 
still alive. Head into the Abbess house and you will find Ershin 
unconscious. Abbess will send you into Ershin's mind again, this time to 
wake her up. 

When you are in Ershin's Mind, keep following the path and jump to over 
the gap to the platform to the north. Open the chest for 2 Knockout 
Gases. Now jump back and continue along the path until you reach a fork. 
All the side paths lead you to a dead end so continue on the main path. 
You will reach another fork. Take the first north path to reach a chest 
containing a Manly Clothes. Now head back to the fork and take the 
second north path and continue along it until you reach the shrine. 
Enter the shrine to find Ershin. Wow! She is surrounded by lots of 
hunks... Anyway, she will tell you that Ryu is missing half of the 
Emperor. The Empire's summons them because they wish to harness the 
power for their own benefit. She tells you that the two halves will 
definitely miss and fate cannot be changed. It seems that Ryu is the 
only one who can stop the Emperor. After the conversation, head out of 
the shrine and out of Ershin's mind. 

When you are back in the reality, Ershin will wake up and tell you that 
Ryu can obtain more power in the Yorae Shrine. She will also tell you 
that her real name is Deis and Ershin is what the Armor called her. 
After the conversation, exit Chek and you will be back on the world map.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Head south along the path. A exclaimation mark will stop you. Enter the 
area. Your party and Deis are passing through the canyon when Ershin 
will appear! It seems that some of Deis power have rubbed off onto it, 
enabling it to move and talk. Deis abandons Ershin, the armor and Nina 
will suggest that she heads back to the village and wait. After the 
conversation, exit the area to arrive at the world map again. Now you 
can check your Faerie Colony if you want. There should be a few more 
Faeries and the total population should be a around 15. At this point i 
have 18 faeries and the culture level is 95, everything is more or less 
maxed out. I think you should try to develop the colony more if you are 
on the less that 15 faeries side. You can get good items and weapons 
from the faeries shop and various benefits. You might also want to 
consider switching master. 

Anyway, when you are ready, head into Sinchon, the Yorae Shrine. Enter 
the Shrine, then head north into the next area and you will find 
yourself in a large room. One important thing to do while you are 
proceeding through the shrine is that you must learn the sacrifice 
skill. If you encounter a protobot, use combo to make it burst open. 
When it burst open, it will use sacrifice after two turns. One should 
also try to steal a multigun from either the bots or the protobots. It 
is hard to steal it, but you CAN steal it. It takes me more than 70 
tries to get it. Ignore the treasure chest because you will get it later 
and head north into the next area.

In the next area, head across the corridor and passing the first doorway 
and into the doorway at the south. Continue along the path and you will 
reach the chest that you saw earlier on. Open it for 2 Swallow Eyes. Now 
head back and enter the other doorway to reach the next area. In the 
next area, continue north along the path and enter the doorway at the 
end to reach the next area. In the next area, head north and along the 
east side of the wall. Head up the stairs and through the doorway to 
reach the next area. In the next area, jump onto the first orange pillar 
from the western ledge. Jump your way to the platform with the chest. 
Open it to get 3 Dragon Scales. 

After taking it, head back out of this room. Head down the stairs and 
proceed south along the east wall to the entrance of this screen. Now 
head north along the west wall and through the doorway to reach the next 
area. You will arrive at the lower part of the room with those orange 
pillars. Head north and examine the symbol on the wall. Two pillar will 
rise up and a hourglass will appear. This is the time the orange pillars 
will remain in the position. Now hurry back to the previous room and 
head to the room along the eastern side of the wall. Now quickly jump 
off the western ledge and jump your way across pillars to the north side 
of the room. When you get to the north side, quickly stand on the 
western pillar. Wait for the time to run out and the pillar will 
descend. Enter the room at the bottom to find 2 Magic Shards and a Soul 
Ring. Now head back and examine the symbol. Repeat everything but this 
time stay on the north side. Head through the doorway to the next area. 
Continue north to the next room. Then head north out of the room through 
the lighted doorway. You will be back outside. They will attempt to call 
upon the dragons. Now the screen will switch back to Fou-Lu who is still 
in Sonne.

The ground will shake for a short while and you will control Fou-Lu. 
Exit to this screen and the ground will shake again. Continue along the 
path to find Mami. She will tell you that smoke is coming out from a 
mountain nearby. Looks like it is going to erupt. Smoke also indicates 
that the god of the mountain is angry. Fou-Lu decided to leave sonne to 
find the 'god'. You will be on the world map but head back into sonne. 
Talk to Mami and she will give you a Rice Ball. After obtaining it, head 
back to the world map.

Boss        : 
Skills      :
    Ebonfire      ---> BlackGoo
    Timed Blow    -->  BlackGoo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Lavoids found in this mountain is 'customisable'. Fou-Lu can get 
lots of experience from it if you keep using fire spell on it. The fire 
spell will power it up, causing its statistics to raise. I suggest that 
you only power up it two or three times. It will become very deadly if 
you continue to power it and Fou-Lu will not be his match. Lavoid is the 
monster so far that can kill Fou-Lu. Don't believe? Try powering it five 
times or more. It is wise to escape battle with two Lavoids as you will 
lose a lot of HP if you fight two Lavoids.

Anyway, when you are in Mt. Yogy, Fou-Lu will smash the huge boulder 
blocking the path with a single hit. Head west up the path until you 
reach a intersection. Take the lower north path and jump over the gap. 
Continue on the path a little and you will see a item bag. Take the 
Wisdom Fruit. Now head back to the intersection and take the upper north 
path and continue along it until you reach a fork. The lower path 
lead you to a dead end so head up the upper path until you reach another 
fork. Take the lower path and follow it to reach the crater of the 
mountain. Head into the mountain through the opening in the mountain. 

Inside, You can encounter BlackGoos. You can learn the Ebonfire and the 
Timed Blow skills from them. They will use ebonfire very often and will 
use Time Blow when they have 25% of their HP left. When you are ready, 
follow the path into the next area. In the next area, Head north on the 
path and ignore the first ledge where you can jump. At the north is 
another where you can jump. Jump across to the platform with a chest. 
Open the chest for three MultiVitamins. After taking it, head back to 
the first ledge and jump across the gap. Continue along the path and 
jump across two more gaps. Head north into the next area. In the next 
area, continue along the lengthy and twisting path into the next area. 
In the next area, continue along the path and at the end you will meet a 
huge rock monster. The rock monster called Fou-Lu a tiny man and puny 
man in the conversation. After the short conversation, the rock monster 
attacks.

Attacks :
Focus     : Increase power and counterattack chance
Quake     : Major Earth Damage to all targets
Summon Kin: Call upon two small rock monsters, Klod and Bellwyd

Transform into Astral Dragon on the first turn. In the first turn, Marl 
will summon his two rock servants out. Klod attacks Fou-Lu and Bellwyd 
heals damage and assist magic. Take out Bellwyd with a single physical 
attack than bash Marl with physical attacks. DO NOT kill Klod because if 
you kill Klod, Marl will summon two more servants. It will take you at 
least 8-10 turns to kill him because of his high defense. You can use 
Eraser to speed up the process if you want. Be careful of Klod too 
because he can cast Rock Blast which can hurt a little. After defeating 
Marl, kill off Klod and you will win the battle. You might get a wisdom 
fruit, life shard and a supervitamin after the battle. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After tha battle, make your way out of the mountain and head down the 
mountain path. On the way, you will meet Mami and the Landlord. The 
screen will then switch back to Ryu' group. They suceeded and call upon 
a lot of dragons. The dragons will tell you moe about Ryu as well as 
Fou-Lu. One of them inform you that Fou-Lu has already awakened. Deis 
explains that Fou-Lu has stronger light pillar than Ryu and when they 
join up, Fou-Lu will have control over Ryu. Now the screen will switch 
back to Fou-Lu. Return to Mami's house and take a rest. In the morning, 
use the diary to save. After saving head out of the house and proceed to 
the fields. On the way, a group of soldiers will arrive and it seems 
that it is the landlord who called them here. You cannot proceed 
anywhere except back-track into Mami's house. It seems that Fou-Lu has 
lived in Sonne too long that he does not want to fight the way out and 
destroy the village in the process. Mami will suddenly come into the 
house and block the doorway. Looks like Mami has fall in love with Fou-
Lu and Fou-Lu has some feelings too. Mami 'order' Fou-Lu to escape 
through the hole and head to the shrine in the woods. Now examine the 
crack in the oven and Fou-Lu will crawl out of it. Yohm capture Mami and 
intends to use her. 

Now the screen will switch back to Ryu. The dragons will tell you that 
you can seek their powers. Well, you have already met the Sand Dragon, 
Mud Dragon and you should roughly know where they are. All the dragons 
leave and the Wind Dragon stays behind. The Wind Dragon gives Ryu his 
power and Ryu can now use Rainstorm spell! After getting the skill, head 
out of the shrine. While heading out of the shrine, try to steal a 
multigun from the protobots or bots again if you does not have the gun 
yet. When you are out of the shrine, you will get a sequence in Chek. 

The Abbess informs Ershin that the Imperial Army is in Chek. The Abbess 
had already evacuate everyone and all that is left behind is herself and 
Ershin. Rasso is here to find Ryu, the Yorae Dragon. The Abbess will 
suggest that they leave before the army finds them. When you control 
Ershin, use the diary to save. After saving, head out of the house and 
you will find that the Abbess has been captured. The soldiers will 
attach you, Ershin. Just use physical attacks to trash them. After 
killing them, Ershin will 'invite' the Abbess into her armor. Rasso will 
send more troops after you. Again, use physical attacks to kill them. 
After defeating them, Rasso will ask you to tell him the whereabouts of 
Ryu. Ershin insists to tell him. Rasso use the same old magic to 
knockout Ershin after calling her a trash can. Now the control will 
switch to Ryu. 

Set up a camp to rest and save. Head into Chek. You will find the town 
deserted and the nearly destroyed Ershin will head up to you. It seems 
that Ershin had used up all the power that Deis rubbed on her when 
combating the troops. Deis do not want to get back into Ershin. The 
power depletes and Ershin shuts down. Oh...my expensive set of armor:( 
Cray suggests that they take a look at the villagers in the morning. In 
the next morning, head out of the Abbess house and you will find the 
Abbes outside. She tells you that everyone is in the abandoned village, 
in the mountains to the north of Chek. After talking the her, head out 
of Chek, passing the blacked out Ershin on the way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the world map, head north to reach the mountains. Inside, head north 
until you reach a fork with a north path and a east path. The north path 
leads you to a dead end so take the east path and head on until you 
reach another fork. Take the south path to reach a chest containing a 
Soul Gem. After taking it, head back to the fork and take the north 
path. When you reach another fork, take the lower north path to get to a 
item bag containing a Wisdom Seed. After taking it, head back to the 
fork and take the upper north path. Continue along the path and head up 
the stairs. 

You will automatically get a sequence in a camp. Nina is still sad about 
Ershin(so am i, the armor was good). When you control Ryu, head into the 
camp and rest. You will then get a sequence in Chek. In the next 
morning, you will hear Nina's scream. Head outside the camp to find the 
soldiers. Looks like the Empie have found what they want. Ursula and her 
imperial army are here. Nina begs them to take them to the Abandoned 
Village to see that if everyone is find. Ursula will agree and when you 
reach the Abandoned Vilage, Rasso will greet you. Rasso has killed off

maintain everyone HP but let Ryu dies as fast as you can. When Ryu is 
reduced to 0 HP, he will automatically transform into the Kaiser Dragon 
and use the Kaiser Breath attack to destroy Ight's shield. Now have 
everyone attack him. He will die when Ryu uses another Kaiser Breath. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle, Ryu will lose control of himself and the Kaiser Dragon 
will fire a beam on Rasso and his useless spirit. Ursula ordered them to 
be arrested but the Kaiser Dragon knocks the soldiers off. Now the 
Kaiser Dragon is after Ursula. Luckily, Nina manages to stop Ryu from 
destroying Ursula. With this, Chapter two ends.

the Stone Wall five times and getting itself killed in the process. Now 
that the passage is no longer blocked, enter the passage.

You will encounter Cyclops inside. When his club is broken, he will use 
Spirit Blast, a skill which you can learn. When you are ready, head 
through the passage into the next area. In the next area, continue along 
the passage until you reach a fork. Take the northwest path to reach a 
chest containing a Icicle. After taking it, head back to the fork and 
take the southwest path. Follow it until you reach a blue crystal which 
is blocking the path. Examine and you will find out that it is actually 
a dragon. You will receive the water gem and with it, you can now 
transform into the Serpent! Head through the doorway into the next area. 
In the next area, continue along the path and head out through the

Head into Soma forest. In the forest, head west and you will reach a 
clearing with a tree in the centre as well as many new paths. Take the 
west path and you will reach a chest with a SuperVitamin. After taking 
it, return to the intersection and take the south path to the next area.

automatically. You will see Lord Yuna. He has captured Elina and intends 
to sacrifice her! General Yohm will order the soldier to prepare the 
Carronade. He order him to fire the hex directly into the Soma Forest 
where Fou-Lu is. The Hex directly lands on Fou-Lu. Fou-Lu is once again 
seriously injured. After he collapses, a shiny object will drop from the 
sky and land up next to Fou-Lu.

Now the screen will switch back to Ryu. Nina mentions that Ryu's 
imcompleteness might be the cause for his berserk behavior. Scias will 
then cut off the ropes and freeing Ursula. Your party will then 
automatically head out of the abandoned village. Save if you need, then 
head back to Chek. 

Enter the Abbess's house and you will get a conversation. Haha, Ursula 
is completely blur in the conversation. The abbess then tells you to 
find Deis and Ershin who should be somewhere in the village. Head west 
from the Abbess's house and you will find both Ershin and Deis. Talk to 
Deis and she will return to Ershin, the armor. Your party will 
automatically head out to the world map. Now you finally have a complete 
party. 

Now that you have a complete party, you might want to try achieving 
higher combo and heavier max damage. In the abandoned village, you will 
find groups and trunked and treans which allow you to throw everything 
at them. They recover half HP each turn so you will not be able to 
defeat them at this point. They will not attack every turn but will 
counter physical attacks sometimes. They will escape after some turns. 
At the point, my highest combo is 69 hits and highest damage is 50000. I 
think it is possible to do more than 69 hits at this point so try out 
all combination. Faerie Attack, Faerie Charge and Dragon Breath is the 
combination i used and i have 19 faerie troops and 1 musician.

Take the northwest path and follow the path until you reach a lake. Jump 
across the gaps to get to a chest with a Rocket Punch. Get the Rocket 
Punch and equip it on Ershin. Now jump back across the gap and head west 
along the side of the lake until you reach the next fork. Take the

Use the right and left buttons to maneuver the raft down the river. 
Everytime you hit the bank, a little piece of raft will come loose. If 
the raft is completely destroyed, you will have to start all over again, 
so be careful. You can get extra points by picking up the bags you see 
floating in the river. You can also get bonus points when you reach the 
bottom. Sadly, i only gained 3000 points and 400 bonus points from this 
mini-game. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you reach the bottom of the mountain, your party will discuss a way 
to get to the Empire. Nina suggests getting a Sandflier. Cray mentions 
that the party might be able to hire a sandflier from Shyde. After the 
conversation, just head south out of Mt. Ryft to arrive on the world map 
again. 

Visit your faerie colony because if conditions are right, there should 
be a few newborns. Visit Njomo is you can get some new skills. You 
should also visit Momo to see if you have enough gametime to learn new 
skills. At the point, i was at 50:49 so i was able to learn Momo last 
skill, Egghead.

Shyde is located south of Wyndia. There is not much to do in Shyde since 
you have visited this town before. Exchange for some Aurums at the 
Manillo trading shop to increase the number of stamp cards. You should 
aim to get the Render as soon as possible since it is one of the best 
weapon in the game. Upgrade your treasure ball from the guy behind the 
Inn if you have not done so yet.

continue north and down a stairs. Continue north across the bridge, then 
into the building at the end. Talk to the blue frog inside. The frog 
will not let you purchase one no matter how much zenny you have. He will 
tell you to ask for free ride and informs you that one sandflier is 
arriving soon. Now head out of this building and you will find that the 
sandflier the frog man is mentioning about is leaving! Don't worry, 
Scias and Ursula will jump onto the sandflier just in time and hijack 
it. You will meet Marlok the *pervert*:) again. So the sandflier belongs 
to Marlok. Enjoy the funny sequence... I love it when your two other 
characters shrink in size. Marlok will help you buy a sandflier. He will 
hand you a bond. 

When you control Ryu again, climb up the ladder beside the building and 
talk to the puppeteer there. Ask about shift. You are now able to use 
the shift spell. Shift lets you travel instantaneously to any city, 
village or places you have been to. Wow! That's great. To use it, press 
the seclect button while you are on the world map. You will also find 
out from him that powers given by dragons have a penalty. You will have 
to rest at a inn in order to use it again. After talking to him, you 
should head back to the world map to test the shift skill. 
Unfortunately, you cannot shift to any place. All places are marked by a 
black dot. You will have to pass through every places one by one in 
order to make them turn red. When you are done, head back into Shyde. 
Head back into the building at the sandflier dock and talk to the frog 
man again. You will now have your own sandflier. That *pervert* is sure 
generous. You will then be taught how to pilot a sandflier. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Time: Race against time
Fun Factor: 9/10
Difficulty: 2/10

Use the Right and Left buttons to control the heading of the sandflier. 
Press the 'O' button to accelerate. You will continue to accelerate for 
as long as you hold the button. Press the 'X' button to brake. The brake 
will work as soon as the button is pressed. You can jump by driving over 
the sand dunes in the desert. Try moving the directional buttons in a 
circle while jumping. It is basically just like a racing game. Just look 
at the track map and you will get to Kyoin soon. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you are in Kyoin, head up to the imperial causeway. The guard there 
will inform you that the imperial causeway no longer work. It seems that 
during your last visit to the imperial causeway, you have shutted down 
the gateway. Head back to Kyoin's sandflier dock and you will get a 
sequence. You will find a bandit standing next to your sandflier. Tell 
him that you own the sandflier and agree to take him with you to Shikk. 
He also tells you that there is a lake near Shikk which leads to the 
western continent. 

=======================================================================
3.5    World Tour
=======================================================================

Before actually heading to shikk, there are a lot to do right now, so 
choose to head outside of Kyoin. When you are outside, please visit your 
first two master, Rwolf and Stoll/Stole. You should be able to learn 
everything from them. After visiting them, you should obtain new dragon 
evocation spells. You can be a couple of dragon at this point.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mud Dragon

Head your way to the '?' spot north of the Dam. Enter it and head to the 
centre of the several pillars to find Ni Ryong in the human form. Talk 
to him with Ryu in the lead. He will give Ryu the Mud Flow spell. After 
learning it, it is time to find the next dragon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Grass Dragon

The only possible place to find the Grass Dragon is the plains where 
there are a lot of grass. Head to Tarhn's camp and talk to her. She will 
tell you that in order to meet the grass dragon, you will have to find a 
shining bird. After talking to her, head into the plains. head east 
until you reach the big rock. Wait there for a few minutes until the 
shining bird shows up and land on the ground near the big rock. Wait for 
it to fly, then follow it. On the way, you will pass some rocks and one 
of the rock is marked with two red strips. If you see the rock, then you 
are heading in the right direction. Continue to follow it and after a 
few minutes, you will see a pale dragon form on the plains. Approach it 
and you will enter a area. Talk to the human form Ch'o Ryong and you 
will get its power! Ryu is now able to use the Healing Wind skill.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Boss and New Fishing Spot

After meeting the grass dragon, you might want to fish. There is a new 
fishing spot that you can fish now. Head into North Chamba and you will 
see a man sitting next to the wall. Talk to him to find out that a huge 
monster is in the hex. Head into north chamba, then follow the path 
until you reach the side of the roof. A huge fish will arise and attack 
you!

Boss Fight: Angler
Stats   :
HP: 20,000   EXP: 12,000   Zenny: 1,560   Spoils: Deep Diver, Fish-Head
Weakness: None
Strength: Earth 
Attacks :
Feint   : Confuse one target
Chlorine: Poison one target
Curse   : Remove half HP from all targets
Jolt    : Wind + Water based spell on all targets

This boss isn't tough but will take you some time to defeat it. Keep 
using combos on this boss. DO NOT use physical attack because they will 
do little damage to this boss. In the first turn, have Ryu transform 
into the Aura Dragon and have everyone use spells. If Ursula has Cyclone 
spell, then have her use it, followed by Nina using it. Then have ryu 
use the dragon breath attack. You can kill this boss faster if you use 
strong combination spells like Thunderstorm, Disaster and Ragnarok. It 
will take a while but if you keep your HP high, then you should be able 
to defeat this boss. 

After defeating it, head out and talk to the man again. He will tell you 
that there are so many fishes beneath the hex that it has become a 
fishing spot. Head back inside to find that it has become a fishing 
spot. Jellyfishes are common in this fish spot and Bullcats are rather 
rare to find. Acherons are extremely rare to find in this spot but this 
spot is the only place to catch acherons. Spinner and Winder are good 
lures to catch acherons unless you have the King Frog. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Treasure Upgrades

You can get two new treasure upgrades at this point of the game. If you 
return to the crash site where the sandflier crashed, you will find a 
mole man. He will upgrade your treasure. Now you can head back to 
Synesta and enter the orphanage. Talk to the girl beside Lyte to upgrade 
your treasure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Masters

There are also two new masters for you at this point. Since you are now 
in Synesta, why not visit Marlok, the generous Manillo. If you have a 
tin ball of better, you can apprentice under him. If you have a copper 
ball or better, you can learn the charm from him. Anyway you should be 
able to learn charm if you have collected all the upgrades on the way. 
Charm increase the chance of stealing items. The Abbess in Chek is 
another master who you can get now. You can just apprentice under her 
but not learning here skills for now. You need to meet more than 70 
types of monsters in order to learn her first skill. This can only be 
done when you are further into the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You have now done what you can do at this stage so you are ready to 
proceed with the game. Now head to Shikk from Kyoin and take the bandit 
along. Once you reach there, he will give you a Silver Top for all the 
trouble. Now you can meet another dragon. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand Dragon

From Shikk, head to Shyde on the sandflier. By looking at the track map, 
you will find a section at the south that is cut off from the main 
track. Now pilot the sandflier to the sand dune just north of the cut 
off section. Use it to fly to the cut off section. You will be send into 
a area. Talk to the sand dragon to receive its power. You can now use 
Onslaught Spell. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After getting the Sand Dragon's power, it is time to proceed with the 
game. Head to the Shikk region. Enter Mt. Giga, your next destination

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6    Mt. Giga
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items       : 800Z, Fire Gem, MultiVitamin, Weather Wand
Monsters    : Legion, Saruga, Yaen
W. Monsters : Bilbul, Fiend, Blue Ball 
Boss        : None
Skills      : 
    Muffle        -->  Saruga
    Blitz         -->  Saruga
    Rest          -->  Yaen
    Chlorine      -->  Yaen
    Last Resort   -->  Bilboa
    Frost Strike  -->  Blue Ball
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: 
The monsters in Mt. Giga are tough. Sarugas and Legions are one good 
example. Saruga uses Muffle oftenly. Sarugas always come with other 
monsters. IF you kill the monster before killing off the sarugas, then 
they will get furious and start using blitz. Legions are another tough 
monsters. They power up when physically hitted. Their statistics 
increase and EXP also increase. I suggest that you do not power them up 
too much or else you will not be able to kill them. Anyway, you can 
steal or pilfer a speed boots off the saruga. 

In the first screen, take the Gondola into the next area. In the next 
area, head south down the ramp until you reach a fork. Take the east 
path to reach a item bag containing 800 Zenny. After taking it, return 
to the fork and take the south path. Jump across the gaps, then head 
north and south and jump to the path below. Head to the south and jump 
off the ledge to the path below. Head east up the ramp, then north and 
jump off the ledge to the red crystal. Examine the red crystals. It is 
the fire gem and you will now be able to transform into Wyvern. After 
taking it, continue your way to the top. Take the Gondola to reach the 
next part of the mountain. 

In the next area, just near the gondola is a fork. Take the upper path 
to reach a item bag containing a MultiVitamin. After grabbing it, head 
back and take the lower path which you lead you to the lower path. Head 
southeast past the the second ramp, then continue along the path and 
jump across two gaps to reach a platform with a chest containing a 
Weather Ward. Equip it on Nina, then head back to the two ramps and head 
up the second ramp to a upper path. Head west along the path and back to 
the world map again. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7    Checkpoint
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items       : Ginseng x3
Monsters    : None
W. Monsters : Legion, Saruga, Yaen
Boss        : None
Skills      : 
    Muffle        -->  Saruga
    Blitz         -->  Saruga
    Rest          -->  Yaen
    Chlorine      -->  Yaen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter the checkpoint. You can find a manillo trading shop inside. Trade 
with him if you need. Now head past the man in green. He will tell you 
that the gate is closed. Ursula will attempt to kill them off with her 
gun but was stopped by the party. Look where Ryu is touching... Cray 
wants to talk to the guard and see if they can allow them to pass 
through. The two guards immediately recognises Cray as Ludia's wanted 
man and attack him. You fight with Cray alone. One physical hit should 
kill one of them. After defeating the two guards, a big squad of army 
will arrive. Cray flees and discuss with the party. Nina suggests using 
the wagons to get out of the gate. 

After the conversation, head to the entrance where you can see a chest. 
There is a wagon nearby. Push it west a bit until it is in line with the 
platform with the chest. Climb the ladder up to the roof of the house 
nearby. Just to the wagon you just pushed, then you should land on the 
platform with the chest. Open it to find three ginsengs. You can also 
find the bandit here. He is standing in front of a house. Behind the 
house is a man. Talk to him to find out that the Tree of Wisdom is 
nearby. Tell him that you do not know about the tree of wisdom and he 
will tell you its location. He says that someone told him that somewhere 
in the woods on the road to shikk is a tree that can talk. 

After talking to him, head to the north part of the town. Push the east 
wagon north three times. Then push the west wagon east until it is in 
line with the two wagons. Now that you have positioned the three wagons, 
head to the roof again. This time jump off from the north side. Now 
watch the sequence and when it ends, you will be out of the checkpoint! 
Jump down the ledge and head north to arrive on the world map. 

On the path between the checkpoint and Shikk, get into a '?' place. You 
will find yourself in a canyon. Head north and east when you reach a 
fork. Continue east out of the canyon to be on the world map again. A 
new route will appear. Head into the new place. Inside, you will find 
the Tree Dragon, Su Ryong. Put Ryu in the lead and talk to him. He will 
give you his power. Now Ryu will be able to use the Holy Circle.

There are total of four main elements in Breath of Fire IV. They are 
Fire, Wind, Water and Earth. You can combine these four main elements to

too. More will be cover below.

Combination Combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Magics can combine to form a stronger form of magic and i call them 
combination combos. Fire will only combine with Wind, Wind will only 
combine with Water, Water will only combine with Earth and Earth will 
only combine with Fire. For example when you combine two form of fire 
magic, a stronger form of fire magic will result. To get the best chance 
of creating a combo when combining magic, have the slower character cast 
the magic first and the faster character cast the last magic. For 
instance, have Cray(Slower) cast Rock Blast and Ryu(Faster) cast burn to 
form Eruption. The succession percentage for this type of method is 
about 90%. You can also ignore this slowest to fastest method to create 
combo but the succession percentage will be about only 75%. Please note 
that magic of the same element can also combine with each other to form 
a stronger form of element of the same element and the resultant spell 
will most slightly hit a few times. For example, if the first character 
cast Burn and the second character cast Flare, the Flare will hit twice 
and the damage per hit will also increase.

Element 'Cycle':
       Fire
   .----->-----.
 E |           | W

   '-----<-----'
       Water

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Effect Combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you combine attacks that heal or affect status, the effects of each 
will be increased as well. For example, if you combine Heal and Protect, 
you'll be able to restore some HP at the same time you raise your 
defense! Furthermore if you combine status affecting attacks with 
physical skills, the attack will add status effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mixed Combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not necessary that you need to combine magic to do a combo. Even 
if the magic doesn't combine, you CAN still do a combo. Follow the 
slowest to fastest method to increase the chance of a combo. 

e.g Rock Blast + Eddy + Sever

   iv  Dragon Guide
=======================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Knowledge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dragon system in Breath of Fire IV is very different from the Dragon 
system in Breath of Fire III. In BOFIV, Ryu or Fou-Lu turns into a 
dragoon instead of a dragon. The dragoon form of every dragon is the 
same in terms of appearence. What differs is the Statistics of each 
dragons. In dragoon form, Ryu/Fou-Lu can access his dragon skills, 
skills. Ryu learns no spells when gaining level, but will obtain 
evocation spells from various Dragons hidden all over the world.

You will get your first dragon form automaticall very early in the game 
but you will stick to the first dragon form for quite some time before 
you will get the second dragon form. Note that you will be able to 
transform to more dragon forms once you have gotten the respective gems. 
As i mentioned earlier, Ryu must get his evocation spells from dragons 
all over the world. When you meet these dragons, they will bestrow their 
powers to you, granting Ryu new spells.

There is a price to pay for the incredible powers the dragons possess. 
AP will be used when Ryu/Fou-Lu transform into 'dragon' and AP will be 
drain each turn while Ryu/Fou-Lu is in the dragon form. When AP is all 
used up, they will revert to the human form. The AP used up when 
transforming into dragons is different for every dragons but they all 
depends on Ryu/Fou-Lu's level. At high levels, dragon transformations 
will cost more AP. The AP drained each time is equal to 1/4 the 
transformation AP. 

Think that the AP needed is way too high? I have a solution. First you 
will have to get a Shaman's Ring from a Lazy Faerie Weapon Shop, then 
equip it on Ryu. Now the transformation AP will be reduced to 3/4 of the 
original AP needed. So if Ryu is at level 40 and Aura will cost 40 AP 
originally, the AP needed will be reduced to 30 if Ryu is equipped with 
the Shaman's Ring.

=======================================================================
    v  Faerie Magic
=======================================================================
You can learn faerie magic from Master Njomo. She will teach you new 
skills depending on the development of the faerie colony. The first 
skill you will learn from her is faerie attack, followed by faerie 
breath, then followed by War Shout and finally Faerie charge. These 
faerie magic are really POWERFUL if you have a lot of faerie troops and 
high level barracks. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Faerie Attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting It : 
Get it from Njomo once there are more than 8 faerie in the colony.

Discription: 
Faerie troops swoop down and drop either small or big bomb on the 
enemies. Target are random. Damage depends on target's defense.

Information:
Small bomb hits single target and big bomb hits all target. Number of 
faeries that come into the battlefield and drop bombs depend on the 
number of faerie troops you have in your colony. The chance that they 
drop big bombs depends on the barrack level. The higher the level, the 
more likely a big bomb will be dropped. At very high barrack level, the 
chance of dropping big bombs is very high. This magic is really 
effective when your barracks level are over 70.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Faerie Breath
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting It : 
Get it from Njomo once there are more than 12 faerie in the colony.

Discription: 
Restore all party members' HP and cure status with some accuracy

Information: 
The amount of HP your party members recover depends on the happiness in 
your faerie colony. The chance of curing status also depends on the 
happiness in your colony.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
War Shout
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting It : 
Get it from Njomo once there are more than 16 faerie in the colony.

Discription: 
Increase front row member's power by some percentage, depending on the 
number of troops and musicians. Troops is what really matters.

Information: 
Definitely one of the best magic in this game. You can even raise front 
row's power by more than 60%. Again, it depends on the number of troops 
you have as well as the barrack level. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Faerie Charge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting It :
Get it from Njomo once there are more than 20 faerie in the colony.
 
Discription: 
Faeries circles the enemy and holding each other arms. After a while, 
all of them charge at the enemies dealing a lot of hits depending on the 
caster's accuracy

Information: 
The magic can be considered one of the most damaging magic in the game. 
You will need at least 6 faerie troops in order to use this. The amount 
of damage the faerie inflicts depends on the amount of EP/HP they have 
and the barrack level. The accuracy depends on the caster. For this 
magic to be most effective, be sure to use some accuracy raising items 
or spells on the caster before using it.

    i  Fishing
=======================================================================
Fishing is a very vast game in Breath of Fire IV. It is very detailed 
and fun. Most of the Fishing Spot in Breath of Fire IV are hidden and 
you must find them in order to complete the fish list. You will only 
need a lure and a rod to fish but there are many types of lures, so this 
part of my guide will tell you everything about fishing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints & Tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. When the fish swin away from you, stop reeling for a while but start 
   reeling again immediately. The fish will stop fighting and will let 
   you reel it in. Continue this process until you have reeled the fish 
   in. 

2. Try other spot in the fishing spot if you always catch the same type 
   of fish. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fishing Spot
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

River Spot 1:
Fish    : Jellyfish, Sweetfish, Trout, RainbowTrout
Location: There is a '?' spot along a route from Sarai. Enter to find 
          yourself in a Canyon. There is a side path, head out of it 
          and you will arrive on the world map again. A new route 
          leading to the river spot 1 will appear. 
Help    : Cast line near base of waterfall. Aim for ripples on the 
          water. Cast from the east shore and aim for the area with 
          some vegetation and lots of insects,

Lake Spot 1:
Fish    : Jellyfish, Piranha, Bass, Blue Gill, MartianSquid
Location: There is a '?' spot on the route between Synesta and 
          Sandflier Wharf. Enter and read a signboard. Once you leave, 
          a new route leading to lake spot 1 will appear.
Help    : Cast line to places near the rocks. Areas with insects 
          hovering is also good places to cast the line. Just be 
          careful of snagging the line when you reel too close to the 
          rock.

Ocean Spot 1:
Fish    : Man-o'-War, Flying Fish, Blowfish, Sea Bream
Location: Beginning of Chapter 2, there is a '?' spot on the route 
          between Shyde and Ludia. Enter and read a sign. When you 
          arrive back on the world map, a new route leaing to the Ocean 
          Spot 1 will appear.
Help    : On the rocky place in this ocean spot is a fantastic place to 
          fish. Casting your line to the small area surrounded by rocks  
          will lure in Blowfish almost everytime. Standing on the big 
          rock, you can cast your line past the buoys, allowing to 
          catch some splendid fishes.

River Spot 2:
Fish    : Jellyfish, Trout, Browntail, RainbowTrout, Salmon 
Location: After visiting Wyndia, the King tells you to go to Kasq 
          Woods. On the first screen of the Woods is a fisherman. Talk 
          to him to know about a fishing spot. When you leaves the 
          Woods, a new route leading to the River Spot 1 will appear.

Ocean Spot 2:
Fish    : Man-o'-War, Sea Bass, Flatfish, Octopus, Bonito, Spearfish, 
          Whale
Location: After you reach Lyp by ship, take the ship out and head 
          upward. Look for a blue flag. Enter it and you will find 
          yourself in Ocean Spot 1.

Lake Spot 2:
Fish    : Bass, Piranha, Blue Gill, Black Bass, MartianSquid, Dorado
Location: There is a '?' spot on the route between the Jungle and Lyp. 
          Once inside, exit the area through a side path.

Saldine Spot:

          Spot while you are on the Flats.

Lake Spot 3:
Fish    : Jellyfish, Angelfish, Black Bass, MartianSquid, Dorado, 
          Barandy
Location: Speak to a fisherman in Chique on the docks. He mentions  
          about a fishing spot to the north of Chique. Exit Chique and 
          a new route leading to Lake Spot 3 will appear. 

River Spot 3:
Fish    : Sweetfish, Trout, Browntail, RainbowTrout, Salmon, Bullcat, 
          Sturgeon
Location: After you visited Fou-Lu's tomb with Ryu, go to a '?' spot 
          west of the tomb. You will arrive at the forest which is set 
          on fire during Fou-Lu's Chapter 1 scenario. Head up the 
          mountainside to the burnt forest and exit through the south 
          exit. A new route leading to the River Spot 3 will appear. 

Ocean Spot 3:
Fish    : Flying Fish, Sea Bass, Flatfish, Octopus, Bonito, Angler
Location: There is a '?' spot on the route between the Highway and the 
          '?' area south of Kwanso. Enter it and read a sign on a 
          signboard. Exit the area and a new route leading to Ocean  
          Spot 3 will appear on the world map.

Chamba Spot:
Fish    : Jellyfish, Bullcat, Acheron
Location: On Chapter 3, return to North Chamba by the back entrance. 
          When you are inside, fight an optional boss, Angler and after 
          defeating it, North Chamba will become a fishing spot.

the monsters out of the faerie colony, and when you reach Ahm Fen, a 
faery will approach you and beg you to be their leader. Agree to help 
them and you can play this game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
The objective is to develope the faerie village to a fully-functional 
village. It takes every bit of your intelligence and patient. It is like 
a strategy game where everything from jobs to the well-being of the 
faeries are under your control. 
The management menu look like the one on below:

Births:
As the village developes, you will need more faeries to run the village, 
that is why you will need to know how the birth system works. A new 
faery will be born for every 10 battles you fight, providing that the 
food supplies are more than four times the current number of faeries. To 
keep the population growing, always keep the food supply high. The 
statistics of the new born depends on he culture level which is covered 
below.

Growth and Culture:
The village starts form a undeveloped village to a developing village 
and finally to a developed village. The village in fact must goes 
through a lot more stages to become a developed village. Growth and 
Culture are two primary factors to getting a well-developed village. The 
two forms of growth are mainly buildings and faeries. Culture plays an 
important role because it refers to many things about the village. It 
affects the jobs available, sale items in stores and the statistics of 
the new born. The top right icon(book) at the top of the management menu 
displays the culture level. Clearing lands and developing the lands is 
the only way to build up the culture level. In order to gain new jobs, 
culture level must reach to certain level. Below is the Culture levels 
List.

Culture Level 15: Item Shop        Culture Level 50: Music
Culture Level 20: Inn              Culture Level 60: Art
Culture Level 25: Weapon Shop      Culture Level 70: Aurum Trading
Culture Level 30: World Search     Culture Level 80: Games 
Culture Level 40: Troops           Culture Level 90: Bonds

Faerie Statistics:
Every faerie is unique and suitable for different types of job. 
EN : Endurance
KN : Knowledge
SL : Style
Faerie with high EN is suitable to do jobs which requires endurance and 
physical labour. Clearing land is one example of such jobs. Faeries with 
high KN should be assigned to manage shop. Faeries with high SL should 
be assigned to jobs which requires arts and musical talents. 
Furthermore, there are four faerie personality types. They are Lazy, 
Ordinary, Diligent and Odd. Each personality will affect how hard the 
faerie will work as well as what the shop owner will be selling.

Assigning Jobs:
The Faeries can't organise themself without you help. You only gets 3 
faeries when you first start to build the Faerie Colony. Starts off by 
ordering one Faerie with high HP to hunt animals and have the other 2 
clear land. Once there is free land available, you can start to build 
houses. When you have houses, you can assign new jobs which will benefit 
you more. Each house can hold a maximum number of 3 faeries. Some jobs 
will benefit you if you place the second and third faeries into the 
building.

Notice Board:
The signboard in the Faerie Village inform you of new births, jobs and 
happenings in the village. Some notices will be rubbish written by 
boring faeries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Building is VERY important in the Faerie Colony game. It provides homes 
and jobs for the faeries. You can only build houses on cleared land. The 
village starts off as a forest with no free land available. You must 
assign faeries to clear the lands. The faeries who are clearing the land 
will automatically move to building the houses. Once the houses are 
done, they will continue clearing lands.

Houses:
Houses are necessary for all jobs excluding hunting, plowing land and 
growing food. Assign a job to the house to use it, then assign faeries 
to do the job. The maximum number of faeries per house is three. Even 
houses have statistics. They affect or simply represent the quality of 
work being done inside the house. You can see the activity of the house 
by the length of the green bar on the command screen. Houses also have 
hidden statistics depending on the number of houses around them. If 
there are houses near the house, work will be done faster meaning you 
will have new items and weapons on sale faster if they are houses placed 
near the item or weapon shop. Place houses side by side for the best 
result.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hunting:
Hunting is VERY important to the village. Faeries gain food while 
hunting. Without food, faeries will suffer famine and die. The amount of 
stored food in the colony also affect whether a new faery will be born. 
It also affect the faerie's attitude towards you.
Always keep about 1/3 of the population hunting to maintain food supply. 
EP is factor to look out when assigning faeries for hunting. You will 
encounter hunting faeries on the world map. When you encounter them, 
they are out-numbered by the beasts. You must help them kill the animal 
as well as maintaining the food supply. You will have to chase the 
animals about. The animals run as fast as you are so there's no way you 
can outrun them. Use Ryu's sword of Ursula's gun to hunt the animals 
down. If you injured them, you must kill them as soon as possible 
because as they run, their meat amount will decrease. The only to kill 
them is to chase them down to the trap or use your party to completely 
block off the path of the animal. The encountering chance and the meat 
obtained from each animal are listed below.

.---------------.-----------------------.
|Faeries Hunting|Percentage of encounter|
|---------------+-----------------------|
|       0       |          0  %         |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plowing and Building
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you first start the faerie colony game, have many faeries clear the 
land. You can only build houses in cleared land. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Growing Crops
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a big tree in the village and you can get seeds from the tree. 
The effect of the seeds last until you rest so they can be REALLY useful 
when navigating long dungeons. Just place some faeries in the third 
large box and they will grow the seeds. To help the crops grow, you will 
need to supply the faeries with fertilizers. You will know when the 
crops are ripe by looking at the tree. Use Ershin's field ability to 
knock down the seeds. 

Harvest Time:
The time taken for the glowing the crops depends on the intelligence of 
the faeries assigned to the job. Smart faeries grow crops faster while 
dumber faeries grow crops slower. You can also combine a few low 
knowledge faeries to get the work done faster too. Below is the harvest 
time chart. 
   
.--------------------.----------------.
| Combined Knowledge | Battles Needed |
|--------------------+----------------|
|        1-50        |       16       |
|       51-100       |       14       |
|       101-200      |       12       |
|       201-300      |       10       |
|    301 and higher  |       8        |
'--------------------'----------------'

Note: For every diligent faerie you assigned to this job, substance 2 
      battles. For every lazy faerie you assigned to this job, add 2 
      points.

Fertilisers:
The fertilisers used influence the type and number of seeds harvested. 
Fishes, Bird Drop, Scorchedrice and Rotten Meat are the four maim types 
of fertilisers. Different fertilisers have different fertiliser points. 
Bird Drops, Scorchedrice and Rotten Meat equals to only one fertiliser 
point. Different fishes have different fertiliser points. The fertiliser 
points of each fish is listed below.

Different total number of points will yield different number of seeds. 
The chart below tells you the number of seeds harvested for certain 
amount of fertiliser points.

Seed Types:
Different types of fertiliser you used will produce different types of 
seeds. There are a total of four types of seeds. They are the elemental, 
Statistics, Parameter and Mixed seeds.

Elemental Seeds are the easiest type of seed to get and it raises your 
resistance to certain types of elements.
 ____________
| Elemental  |
|------------+----------------------------.
|Fire Seed   |Fire resistance +2          | 
|Wind Seed   |Wind resistance +2          |
|Water Seed  |Water resistance +2         |
|Earth Seed  |Earth resistance +2         |
|Pheonix Seed|Death resistance +2         |
|Spirit Seed |Mind resistance +2          |
|Vigor Seed  |Status changes resistance +2|
|Holy Seed   |Healing Spell +1            |
'------------'----------------------------'

Statistic Seeds are seeds that raise user's four statistics.

 _____________
|  Statistic  |
|-------------+-----------.
|Strength Seed|Power +10  |
|Hard Seed    |Defense +10|
|Speed Seed   |Agility +10|
|Sage Seed    |Wisdom +10 |
'-------------'-----------'

Parameter Seeds are seeds that raise user's hidden statistics.
 ___________
| Parameter |
|-----------+-----------------------.
|Dodge Seed | Dodge attacks + 20%   |
|Reflex Seed| Accuracy + 15%        |
|Sight Seed | Learning + 50%        |
|Strike Seed| Critical chance + 10% |
|Target Seed| Counterattacking + 20%|
'-----------'-----------------------'

Mixed seeds are very rare and they raise many atatistics at once. 
 ____________
|   Mixed    |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------.
|Draught     |Power, Defense, Agility and Wisdom +5                  |

Obtaining the seeds you want:
The seeds you obtain depends on the type of fertiliser you used. The 
fertiliser points influence the type of seeds you will receive. There 
are some specific fertilisers that you must use to obtain the type of 
seeds.
To get Elemental seeds, use:
Angelfish, Angler, Barandy, Bass, Black Bass, Black Porgy, Blowfish,
Blue Gill, Browntail, Dorado, Moorfish, Piranha, Rainbow Trout, Salmon,
Sea Bass, Sea Bream, Spearfish, Sweetfish, Trout, Bonito, Whale

To get Statistics seeds, use:
Bullcat, Flatfish, Flying Fish, Sturgeon

To get Parameters seeds, use:
Acheron, Jellyfish, Man-o'-War, Martian Squid, Octopus

Getting Mixed seeds is very tough and requires some calculation. This is 
where Bird Drops, Scorchedrice and Rotten Meat comes into use. These are 
added after the fishes are added. For every one of the extra items you 
add, there is a 25% chance of it become a mixed. You can only get a 
maximum of 1 mixed seed no matter how high is the fertiliser points. 

Once you know what type of seed you will get, you can figure out what it 
will take to get the exact seed you want of that type. First total up 
the fertiliser points you used, then divide by the total number of seeds 
for that type. What determine the sed you get is not how many times you 
can divide into the total points, but the remainder after doing so. For 
example if you used 2 whales as the fertilisers. 64 + 64 = 128 points. 
There are a total of 8 elemental seeds, so divide 128 by 8. You will get 
a remainder of 0. Once you figure out the remainder, look at the chart 
below for what seeds you will get.

 ____________ ______________ ____________ _________
| Elemental  |  Statistics  | Parameter  |Remainder|  
|------------+--------------+------------+---------|
|Fire Seed   |Strength Seed |Strike Seed |    0    |
|Wind Seed   |Hard Seed     |Reflex Seed |    1    |
|Water Seed  |Speed Seed    |Dodge Seed  |    2    |
|Earth Seed  |Sage Seed     |Sight Seed  |    3    |
|Spirit Seed |              |Target Seed |    4    |
|Vigor Seed  |              |            |    5    |
|Phoenix Seed|              |            |    6    |
|Holy Seed   |              |            |    7    |
'------------'--------------'------------'---------'

To save the time for calculation of remainders, i have worked out 
FORMULAS for the combined number of fertiliser points required to get 
the exact seeds.

Formulas:
1 point  = Wind Seed
Every extra 8 points = Wind Seed
2 points = Water Seed
Every extra 8 points = Water Seed
3 points = Earth Seed 
Every extra 8 points = Earth Seed
4 points = Spirit Seed
Every extra 8 points = Spirit Seed
5 points = Vigor Seed
Every extra 8 points = Vigor Seed
6 points = Phoenix Seed
Every extra 8 points = Phoenix Seed
7 points = Holy Seed
Every extra 8 points = Holy Seed
8 points = Fire Seed
Every extra 8 points = Fire Seed

1 point  = Hard Seed
Every extra 4 points = Hard Seed
2 points = Speed Seed
Every extra 4 points = Speed Seed
3 points = Sage Seed
Every extra 4 points = Sage Seed
4 points = Strength Seed
Every extra 4 points = Strength Seed

1 point  = Reflex Seed
Every extra 5 points = Reflex Seed
2 points = Dodge Seed
Every extra 5 points = Dodge Seed
3 points = Sight Seed
Every extra 5 points = Sight Seed
4 points = Target Seed
Every extra 5 points = Target Seed
5 points = Strike Seed
Every extra 5 points = Strike Seed

Hope that these formulas help.

Inn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
She allows you to rest and save at no price.

Second Faerie:
The second faerie you assigned to the Inn provides you with statistics 
for monster encounters, number of times you have rested at a Inn, the 
number of times you have camped and the total amount of Zenny you have 
earned.

Third Faerie:
The third faerie you assigned to the Inn tells you how many chests and 
cabinets you have searched before, how many treasures you have collected 
and the number of times you have visited the fish spot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You can assign faeries to search the world for items once you reached 
culture level 30. It is the most dangerous job a faerie can come across 
but you will get many rare and unique items. You can search three places 
together at one time with three faeries. After you have choosen the 
faerie to send for 'world tour', select a region from the list. 
Different regions have different difficulty. Regions with higher 
difficulty definitely yields good items. I would suggest that you send 
faeries with high EP to search the world so that they will not die so 
easily. The difficulty level is divide into 5 levels and time needed for 
faerie to return from the trip varies from difficulty to difficulty.

Search Times:

Level 1: 8  Battles
Level 2: 11 Battles
Level 3: 14 Battles
Level 4: 17 Battles
Level 5: 20 Battles

Search Results:

'-------------'-------------'-------------'-------------'-------------'

Misfortune:

Faeries might die in the search mission. Seeing Death notices on the 
signboard may be heartbreaking but its part of the life. To reduce the 
chance of faeries dying, send faeries with suitable EP for the mission. 
Below is the Death Chart.

.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.
|Level|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |
|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| EP  |      Death Percentage       |
|-----+-----------------------------|   
| 50  | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% | 50% |
|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| 100 |  8% | 16% | 24% | 32% | 40% |
|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|

You should also know the difficulty of every region in order to lower 
the death percentage to the minimum. Below is the chart.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Troops
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The spells you learnt from Njomo, the master rely on the number of 
faerie soldiers in your colony. They affect the damage of the spells.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Music
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
You can listen to all the tracks played in the game. You will begin with 
one track and will get more as you fight more battles. There will be one 
new track for every four battles you fight. Please note that you can 
only get tracks that you have already heard in the games. Tracks of 
other places in the game can only be obtain once you have clear the 
area. 

Second Faerie:
The second faerie is a singer and will sing you songs that you cannot 
understand but it is relaxing to listen to those songs.

Music: 
Starlight Run


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Art
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
You can look at the artwork of characters and monsters found in the game 
if you assign a faerie to this job. Just like the music, you will only 
get a new artwork for every 4 battles you fight. Again, you will have to 
wait till you past certain place before some artwork will appear. 

Artwork:
1.  Ryu sitting on a Tree Stump
2.  Nina
3.  Sand Dragon
4.  Cray and the Worens
5.  Mud Dragon
6.  Ershin and the Purifiers
7.  Wind Dragon

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Aurum
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
The first faerie will trade Aurums. You can buy them and sell them and 
the sale price and sell price depends on the market. The market varies 
randomly with every battles you fight. Buy the Aurums at low prices and 
sell them at high prices to earn big money.

Second Faerie:
The second faerie will predict about the market. She may be right and 
may be wrong sometimes. This is where KN(Knowledge) comes in. Faerie 
with high knowledge will most likely to be correct when predicting about 
the market so assign a smart faerie to this job. A faerie with 250 
knowledge points has a 93% chance to be correct when predicting about 
the market and a faerie with 255 knowledge points is almost a perfect 
predictor.

Third Faerie:
The third faerie will exchange seeds with you for 8 Aurums. Give her 8 
Aurums and you pick your seeds. That's it, it is that easy. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Games
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
The first faerie you assigned to this job will play minigames with you. 
You can win prizes from the game. Assigning one faerie will allow you to 
play Kecak, a rhythm game. You need to press 'O' and 'triangle' to the 
beat given. This game is extremely difficult and you will need a lot of 
practice before you can be very good. There are three prizes to be won 
for this game. Scoring above 800 points will give you a Wisdom Seed. 
Scoring more than 1200 points will give you a Soul Gem and scoring more 
than 1500 points will give you a Harmonic Ring. A 'O' means you hit the 
button just in time but is a little bit inaccurate. A 'flower' means 
that you hit the button at the exact time. A 'X' means that you pressed 
the wrong button or pressed the button too fast or too slow. When you 
first begin playing the game, you will notice that there are hardly any 
flower and you can hardly go beyond 800 points. As you play on, you will 
start to score more flowers but still cannot go beyond 1000 points. 
After about a hour of training or so, you should be able to score 1200 
points and above. Actually it is not worth it to spend your time on this 
game because all the items exchaged hre can be bought in the Faerie 
Shop. By the Way, my record for this game is only 1380 :(

Second Faerie:
The second faerie will change the names of the playable characters for 
you. 

Third Faerie:
The third faerie will play the rock, scissors and paper game with you. 
This game is very easy if you know the concept. Paper wins over rock 
because it can wrap the rock. Rock wins over scissors as it can knock 
the scissors off. Scissors wins over Paper because it can cut paper! 
That is a trick to win this game and it is associated with the 
personality of the faerie. A ordinary faerie is the most predictable. It 
has a 10/16 chance of playing rock so keep using paper. Note that if you 
win the faerie two times consecutively, the 'formula' will reverse, 
meaning if you play with a ordinary faerie, she will start playing 
paper. Play scissors to win her.
You will receive points based on the number of remaining cards you have. 
You will keep your cards and the opponent cards if you win but you will 
lose all the points if you lose. There are some great prizes to be 
exchanged and they are listed below.

1  points: MultiVitamin
2  points: Dress Shoes
4  points: 1000Z
8  points: Midas Stone
15 points: 10000Z
30 points: Soul Ring

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Faerie:
You can buy insurance from the faeries! With the insurance, dying is no 
longer a problem. There are five types of insurance policy. The downside 
is that money obtained from battles will be deducted. Another bonus 
thing about insurance is that after winning 50 battles, you can get a 
refund on the premium cost. 

More information on insurance policies coming soon...

Armors for Ershin. There are a total of seven raw materials to make the 
armors.

Raw Material bonuses:
Glass Shard : A material with bonus in wisdom.
Iron Scraps : A material with bonus in defense but is very heavy.
Bent Screw  : A material with bonus in agility.

              Morphs in the Zhinga Region may drop them if you use an 
              earth-based attack on them.
Dirty Filter: Morphs in the Zhinga Region may drop them if you use an 
              Wind-based attack on them.
Burnt Plug  : Morphs in the Zhinga Region may drop them if you use an 
              Fire-based attack on them.
Rusty Pipe  : Morphs in the Zhinga Region may drop them if you use an 
              Water-based attack on them.

With the information above, you should be able to start making some

stuff, the Happiness bar will still fill up eventually but only slower. 
You can always buy a panacea from shops in later towns.

Press X to use the shovel to dig a hole where you're standing. However, 
the shovel will break after it's used a certain number of times. If it

Turn the Wheel
Section 1.9
Fun Factor: 4/10
Difficulty: 3/10

Listen to the mouse lady carefully, so you will understand how to 'play' 
this mini game. She will tell you to turn the flywheel by hand and when 
the wheel is spinning fast enough, flip the switch. Read the instruction 
too. Ryu will spin the wheel and another person will pull the lever. To 
turn the wheel, keep turning the D-pad in clockwise or anti-closkwise 
direction and the wheel will spin. Wait until it start to produce high-
pitched sound, then press 'O'. If you done it correctly, the big wheel 
outside should turn and the wooden plank will be lowered. After that, 
the mouse lady will give you items for your hard work. Note that you 
will get different items depending on how many times you take to get the 
work done. If you just take one try, then you will receive a toad and if 
you take two tries, then she will give you a silver top. I am certain 
that there are other prizes but i'm not going to find them out. E-mail 
me about other prizes and i will add them as soon as possible.

Hide-and-Seek
Section 1.13
Fun Factor: 8/10
Difficulty: 6/10

The children from the orphanage are hidden somewhere in the town and it 
is up to you to find them. To catch them, find them and talk to them one 
by one. You can see how many children you have left to catch by 
returning to the orphanage and counting how many children are there. By 
the way, there are a total of seven kids. It shouldn't be too hard to 
round up all seven kids as the kids will give you the location of other 
kids. 

One of them is walking about inside the orphanage. Speak to her to catch 
her.

There is another kid in the orphanage. The kid who is mopping the floor 
in the orphanage will tell you that Rudd is hiding under the eastern 
wall. By the way this kid is called Jahn.

Just west of the well under the arch is another kid. He will tell you 
where Goete is. He mentions that he has saw Goete going off towards the 
gate.

Head to the gate in this town to find Goete. The gate is at the west 
side of the town. 

Now head out of the arch and along the outer section of this town until 
you reach a stair. There is a kid standing on the stair. You cannot see 
him carefully but he's there. This is Rudd She will tell you that Modo 
is hiding in somewhere difficult to spot. She will tell you to try 
looking north from the top of the bridge to spot him.

Now head to the top outer section of the town. Head to the bridge and 
look north while walking across it. You should spot a frog kid next to a 
lady. He is Modo. He will tell you where Konoko is. He will tell you how 
to get to him. From the place you are, walk 6 steps south, then 16 steps 
west, then north 1 step, then west 3 steps, then south 3 steps, and then 
west another 4 steps to find Konoko. Ignore his direction. Just head to 
the orphanage and he will tell you to go to the Inn.

Konoko is the last child you'll need to find. He is in the Inn. The Inn 
is located left of the gate where Goete is. Head into the Inn, then up 
the stairs. You will find Konoko here. Catch her and congraduate 
yourself for completing this mini-game.

Difficulty: 8/10

To catch the theif, get close to him and press the 'X' button. He is 
really fast and hard to catch. To catch him, you'll have to block the 
passageways. You must push the barrels to block the passage using Cray's 
push ability. After he ran away, DO NOT chase after him. Wait till the 
camera zoom out. You will see that you are standing at the centre of a 
'Y' path. Block the right with the two barrels nearby, then chase after 
him and make him run in a clockwise direction. When he reaches the 
blocked path, he will turn and run in the other direction. This is the 
time you will catch him. After a few attempt, you should catch him. If 
you mess up, head out of this area and try again.

supposed to go. Those old barrels are not need anymore. Break those old 
barrels if they are blocking the path. After talking to the man, head 
into the room to start working. Read the instruction once more if you 
need. The jars need to be put in the front of the sign in the north end 
of the room and the barrels need to be put in front of the sign in the 
south end of the room. Use Cray's ability to do so. Use Ershin's head 
butt ability to destroy those old and useless barrels.

buttons to move the crane arm. When the hook is directly obove a 
container, press the 'O' button. If you're on target, the hook will 
catch and you can lift the container. You can lower containers you've 
picked up into the ship by pressing the 'O' button again. The ship can 
carry up to 10 containers. Try to load as many as you can in the time 
limit. Use the hook's shadow to guide you as you move the crane. You get 
extra points for putting a container on spaces marked with a blue 
square.

Pilot the raft
Section 3.3
Fun Factor: 7/10
Difficulty: 3/10

Use the right and left buttons to maneuver the raft down the river. 
Everytime you hit the bank, a little piece of raft will come loose. If 
the raft is completely destroyed, you will have to start all over again, 
so be careful. You can get extra points by picking up the bags you see 
floating in the river. You can also get bonus points when you reach the

Use the Right and Left buttons to control the heading of the sandflier. 
Press the 'O' button to accelerate. You will continue to accelerate for 
as long as you hold the button. Press the 'X' button to brake. The brake 
will work as soon as the button is pressed. You can jump by driving over 
the sand dunes in the desert. Try moving the directional buttons in a

    i  Frequently Asked Questions
=======================================================================

Question: I can't get this particular weapon from the monster!!!
Answer  : Some monsters will only drop items if you attack them 
          physically while some monsters will only drop items if you 
          attack them magically.

Answer  : Some monsters requires you to acompanish something before it 
          will start using the skill. For example, you will need to do 
          a 5-hit combo on a Goocount in order for it to start using 
          Icicle.
