1. FAQ

  These are some of the most common questions that people ask me, so in order
to save time I will put them here.  In other words, please stop mailing me
asking these questions.

1 How come some of my characters will do stuff even if I didn't tell them to?
2 How do I combine Elements?
3 Where and what is Shift?
4 How do I evolve dragons?
5 How do I get to Cray's mom on the Golden Plains?

7 Where is the Abandoned Village?

More will be added as thy appear

WARNING: This may contain spoiler material

Q How come some of my characters will do stuff even if I didn't tell them to?
A Nina, Cray, Ershin, and Scias all have a "Proper Will" as the manual calls
  it.  This will allow them to perform certain abilities during the main
  fighting round.  They will not happen all the time, but each has its own
  trigger.  The instruction manual says Ursula has Covering Fire,   but that
  is only a typo(unless I'm missing something).
      Nina - Cheering: When someone in the front row goes critical, she will
                       sometimes cast a healing spell that heals for half of
                       Vitalize, but only if she is in the back row.
      Cray - Guard: If a character in the front row is critical, he may take
                       the damage for them if they get targeted by an attack.
                       It will not work if the attack is a vs. all, and he
                       may still block if he is critical himself, even if it
                       kills him.  It only works if he is in the front row.
      Scias - Rakhasa: When Scias goes critical(his HP turns yellow), this
                       may happen.  What it does is make his next attack a
                       critical attack, like when he uses Shining Blade.
      Ershin - Covering Fire: At the end of a round, Ershin may use this,
                       which all it is, is she will make a normal attack
                       against an enemy(FAQ Authors note: I hate this one,
                       she always attacks when I don't want her to).
      Ursula - Revival: Her chance of reviving herself is a lot higher than
                       the other characters, almost every other time she dies
                       in battle she will come back to life.
----------------
Q How do I combine Elements?
A Magic goes in a circle.       Wind
                                /  \
                             Fire  Water
                                \  /
                                Earth
  Just use magic in a combo with the lines that connect them(i.e. Wind+Water)
----------------
Q Where and what is Shift?
A Shift is an ability you get at Shyde when the plot takes you there.  Go to
  the sandflier bridge area and talk to the boy with a parrot(the same kid
  that teaches you various game mechanics).  When his list comes up choose
  Shift, there should be a star next to it.  Once the explanation is over you
  will have the ability.  You can use it to travel instantly to any spot on
  the map that you've been over(you don't have to enter the area, just walk
  over it) after you get the skill(yes you will have to walk over every dot
  on the map again).
----------------
Q How do I evolve dragons?
A Read the dragon section, evolving has its own 15 minutes of fame.
----------------
Q How do I get to Cray's mom on the Golden Plains?
A When you enter the plains, go east(it should be the direction you start out
  in) until you come to a big rick/boulder.  From there turn left about 45
  degrees, or in simple terms, turn until the red needle is pointing to the
  upper-left in it's little box.  Go that way and you should see a whitish
  line coming up from the plains, that is the smoke from her fire.  Make for
  that and you should get to her place soon enough.  DO NOT LEAVE THE GOLDEN
  PLAINS!!!  You will see her camp with the smoke coming out of the ground
  while on the Golden Plains.  If you leave the Plains so that the over-the-
  shoulder view is gone and you are back to the regular 3/4 view without
  going into the campfire, you left the plains.  Don't do that.
----------------
Q Where is the Sea Dragon?
A The Sea Dragon is located between Lyp and Shikk, and you have to use Zig's
  boat to get to him.  Go northeast out of Lyp(wait for a SW wind).  When you
  pass the cove(it is on an island and has a lake with a big rock and a ship
  coming out of it), you should see lighter blue water with an L-shaped rock
  formation next to it.  Search(use triangle) near the bottom of the L and
  you will wind up on an island.  This is where the dragon is.
----------------
Q Where is the Abandoned Village?
A Northwest of Chek, you will be there at the end of Chapter 2.

=============================================================================
2. Characters

  Each character has their own style in this game.  In addition, each
character is "tuned" into a certain element, which will affect the skills
they are able to learn as the game progresses.

  The rating system will be done as a comparison to the other characters,
each stat gets 1-6, based on the other characters, with 1 being the highest.
This doesn't mean that if they get a six, they stink in that area, it just
means that other characters are better in that area than they are.

Ryu:
Element: Fire(major), Wind/Earth(minor)
Attack: 2
Defense: 2
Magic: 4
Speed: 2
Skill learning: 3
Overall: 1
  Ryu is generally an average character and has innate fire resistance.  In
his transformed states, he is the most powerful character in the game(he
even out powers Fou-Lu at higher levels)
-----------------------------------------
Nina:
Element: Wind
Attack: 6
Defense: 6
Magic: 1
Speed: 1
Skill learning: 2
Overall: 2
  She has the lowest amount of HP, which can hurt in the later parts of the
game, but she makes up for that with her magical abilities and speed.  She
has the highest amount of AP and Int out of anyone, and her strongest spell,
Typhoon, will hit all enemies quite hard.
-----------------------------------------
Cray:
Element: Earth
Attack: 1
Defense: 1
Magic: 6
Speed: 6
Skill learning: 5
Overall: 4
  If you use Cray, you use him for one reason only.  Power.  His attack is
almost as high as Ryu's transformed states and he can take a lot of hits
before he goes down as he has the highest amount of HP of anyone else in the
game.
-----------------------------------------
Scias:
Element: Water
Attack: 3
Defense: 4
Magic: 4
Speed: 4
Skill learning: 6
Overall: 3
  Except for his magical abilities, Scias is one of the best characters in
the game.  His attack is quite powerful, and if you manage to obtain the
Render from the Manillo shops, he can have the highest attack power in the
game!
-----------------------------------------
Ursula:
Element: Fire
Attack: 4
Defense: 5
Magic: 3
Speed: 3
Skill learning: 1
Overall: 5
  Ursula excels at all things, but she is not a master at any of them.  Her
weapons are the only ones that can have attack all on them, those will make
her very useful, but they also have a very low accuracy, making her a mixed
blessing.  To maximize her, apprentice her to Bunyan when you can for his
To-Hit% increase.
-----------------------------------------
Ershin:
Element: All
Attack: 5
Defense: 2
Magic: 2
Speed: 5
Skill learning: 4
Overall: 6
  Ershin is virtually useless for the first half of the game.  After that,
she will become almost as good as Nina at magic, since she learns all 4 level
3 magics, and her Breath attack makes her one of my favorite characters in
the later parts of the game.

3-D:  Compass
3-E:  Dual hero explanation

3-A: Battle

Mini-TOC:
3-A-a: Speed
3-A-b: Learning Skills From Enemies
3-A-c: Magic Combos
3-A-d: Item Magic
3-A-e: Elements
3-A-f: EXP
3-A-g: Running Away
-----------------------
3-A-a: Speed
  In this game, the person who is lined up first actually matters.  The party
will have a speed equal to or lower than that of the front member.  For
example, if Nina has an agility of 50, and Ryu has an agility of 30, and Ryu
is first, then Nina will not go before him, but directly after him.  If you
are trying to do combo magic, then it is best to put the slowest person in
first position.
-----------------------
3-A-b: Learning Skills from Enemies
  If you played Breath of Fire 3, then you are familiar with the fact that
you can learn certain skills from enemies.  However, unlike Breath of Fire 3,
you only have to defend(Guard on the battle menu).  This way, you do not have
to choose an enemy to learn from, you just have to be defending when the
attack is performed.  Another interesting feature is that you can learn some
skills directly from Ryu!  When he is transformed, he will have a list of
different attacks, and some of those can be cast on otherparty members to
have them learn them.
  When you check the enemy with Square, it might show some skills in Red,
Black, or Blue.  Skills that appear in Blue you can learn.  Skills that
appear in Red, you cannot learn.  Skill that appear black are either not
skills or they have already been learned.
  Also, when the enemy casts a spell/skill, if it appears Blue, then it is a
skill you can learn by guarding.  If it is Black, then it is not a learnable
skill.
-----------------------
3-A-c: Magic Combos
  To make a combo out of magic, you have to cast multiple spells in a row.
To do this have the slowest person go first, then have the next slowest, and
so on.  All of the skills will go repetatively, and a combo bar will appear,
showing how many targets have been hit, and what type of spell is being cast.
It does not matter whether the spells are different types or not.  Wild Shot
will combo just as well as Burn.  This opens the door to a large amount of
possible combos, since the only requirements are that they are spells(both
magic and skills are acceptable, as long as it is from the "Special" menu),
and that the spells are cast consecutively.
-----------------------
3-A-d: Item Magic
  Certain items can be used in battle to cast spells for no cost!  These
items do not require any AP to use, and do not ware out.  They may only be
used once per round, though, so having multiple people try to use the same
item will not work unless you have more than one of it.  The first items you
will find like this are the King's Sword(protect), which Ryu starts out with,
and the Royal Sword(Drain), which Fou-Lu starts out with.  Later, more items
will appear that can do other types of magic.
-----------------------
3-A-e: Elements
  Weapons can have different elements on them, which can either make you deal
more or less damage to an enemy depending on that enemies weakness.  If an
enemy has no reaction to that element, then damage will stay the same.  If it
has a weakness to that element, then you will deal massive damage to the
enemy, about 2.5x.  If an enemy is strong against the element, then they will
take very little damage, about 1/4.
-----------------------
3-A-f: Exp
  The amount of Exp you get is done by adding together the Exp that the
monsters give.  For example if one had 30 and another had 20, you would get
50.  This Exp is then divided among the amount of characters you have evenly,
so with 5 people on your team, each would get 10.
-----------------------
3-A-g: Running away
  You can run away from a battle by pressing L1/R1 on the battle menu, then
pressing down to select 'Escape', and then pressing X to attempt to run.  You
cannot run away from certain enemies or bosses.
  When you run away from a battle, you do not gain any exp or gold, but you
will be alive.  There are several reasons for running away:
   The enemies are too powerful and you're going to die if you keep fighting.
   You don't want to fight an enemy to conserve HP/AP for a boss.
   The enemies are too easy and don't give enough EXP.
   You're trying to fight a specific monster.
   You're powering up the skill 'Coward's Way'.
   You're trying to advance in the story and don't want to fight.
  If you kill a monster and then run away leaving other monsters, you will
still gain the EXP/Zenny/Items from killing that monster.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-B: Equipment
  There are a couple of things that should be known about equipping items.

- You can only have 3 pieces of equipment on at one time.
- Helmets, Boots, and Shields are all considered Accessories, so you will
  need to decide whether you  want the added bonus of an accessory, or the
  defensive bonus of armor.  Most of the time though, accessories will work
  better than armor will.
- Weapons that have +1 or more hits are more powerful than weapons without.
  For example, having Ryu equipped with a Moon Sword(attack power 28) will
  have him deal around 350-400 damage.  Having him equipped with a Scramasax
  (power 13,+1 hits) will have him deal 250-300, but with 2 strikes.  So he
  is really dealing 500-600 damage!  These two hits are considered separate
  attacks, so hitting with one does not guarantee hitting with the other, the
  same goes for critical attacks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-C: World Map
  Moving around the world map is a little different from most games.  Instead
of walking on your own, you are given the choice of going to certain places
by pressing that direction on the D-pad.
  Along the way you may encounter ? areas.  These areas are usually places
that you can go to for random battles with enemies from the area you are in.
They can also be used for finding secret areas, like fishing spots.  If there
is a secret place in them, then there will usually be a sign in them, telling
you which way to go.  Then when you exit back out onto the road, you will see
a new path open up from where the ? area is.  These places are also fairly
easy to spot since the ? will appear in the same place every time you go
between the two places.
  Also if you press [Select] while on the map, you can go to a larger version
of the world map where you can see the whole map, and all the places that are
marked.  Later in the game you will get an ability called Shift.  This allows
you to travel to any point on the map that you have walked over after you get
it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-D: Compass
  When you are walking around in a town, dungeon, or another type of area,
then you will see a compass in the upper left corner of the screen.  This is
used to determine which direction you are going, and in this FAQ, I will give
directions on which way to go using that compass.
  The red needle will always point North, whether that's True North or
Magnetic North, Capcom does not say, and it's not really that important.
When you rotate the screen with the triggers(or whatever you have it set to),
the needle will rotate, showing that the direction you will go if you head in
any one way will have changed.
  Halfway between North and South(the white needle) are the other two main
compass directions.  If you go to the right(assuming north is on the top),
that is East.  If you go left, that is West.
  Also, halfway between the main points are other points.  Halfway between
North and East is Northeast.  Halfway between North and West is Northwest.
Halfway between South and East is Southeast.  Halfway between South and West
is Southwest.  Below is a basic drawing of what the game compass looks like.
                  NE
             N-----------E
              |R        |
              |  R      |
            NW|    O    |SE
              |      W  |
              |        W|
             W-----------S
                  SW
R - the Red line(north)
W - the White line(south)
N - North      NE - Northeast     E - East
NW - Northwest                    SE - Southeast
W - West       SW - Southwest     S - South

  When you rotate the screen, the directions follow the arrow(i.e. if you
rotate to where the red needle will point to the upper right, then the other
directions move with it).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-E: Dual hero explanation
  The game will switch between Ryu and Fou-Lu as the main characters, which
Capcom could have done for several reasons.  I think the most likely is that
they wanted to tell the story of Fou-Lu, but to show it as movie sequences
would have been boring.  Also, Capcom might have wanted you to play as Fou-
Lu to get a better understanding of his story.
  The dual hero system works so that Ryu and Fou-Lu will share abilities,
i.e. if Ryu learns Double Blow, Fou-Lu will have it as a skill.  They will
also share dragon transformations with the exception that Ryu is the only one
who can use the Fire-elemental transformations and Fou-Lu is the only one
that can use Water-elemental transformations, and some of the names may be
different, but they are still basically the same.  However, they do not share
inventories, and if you pick something up as Fou-Lu, then you will not be
able to get it again as Ryu.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-F: Game Points
  Throughout the game you will acquire points for performing certain tasks
and mini-games.  These points can be used to evolve dragon forms into a more
powerful version of the form(i.e. Wyvern->Weyr).  Once you obtain the correct
amount of points for the form(see dragon section for them), simply transform
into the dragon you want to evolve and it will happen automatically.
  You gain game points through mini-games and advancing the story.
  You lose game points when you hit people with Ryu's sword, Ershin's bash,
or Ursula's gun(this game is ethical, go figure...).

4. Walkthrough

NOTE: I won't tell you when to save or who to put on which master, I'll leave
  that to your own discretion.
NOTE2: Boss HP are basically guesses based on how much damage it took to kill
  them.

Beginning.

  The game starts with Nina and Cray in the nice little sandflier across the
desert to find Elina, Which starts:

CHAPTER 1: AWAKENING

:1 Signs and Portents


::Crash
  When you finally gain control just exit the screen.

::World Map
  Choose to go to the Cliff.  Along the way you'll stop at an ! area.

:: !
  Watch a scene.  Ryu will join your party now.  Keep going to the cliff.

::Cliff
  Go south down the slope and then east for the stairs.  At the bottom of the
stairs go west over the wooden bridge and under the two overhangs.  After the
second overhang, right before the bridge, there will be a path to the north,
take that to get a bag with an Ammonia.  Then go over the second wood bridge
for a jumping explanation.  After the scene, go north to find a cave.  Go
into the cave and watch another scene.

Switch to Fou-Lu

::Tomb
  Watch the scene then go down the stairs to the next area.  Go up the broken
pillar to the north then across the other broken pillars to the south.  At
the intersection, go west and follow the lighted path for a scene.  Go west
to exit the area.

::World Map
  Go to the only place available to you.

:: ? (forest)
  When you are inside, go south.  Just keep following the path and you will
get a scene, and afterwards, a boss.
 Boss: Kahm
HP: 17,000
Attacks:
::Flaming Fist - Fire elemental attack
::Mystic Fire  - Fire elemental breath attack
- It uses fire attacks so watch out.
- Just use Frost Strike(Astral)against it and you shouldn't have any problem.
:Win
  EXP:   16000
  Zenny: 0
  Items: Ambrosia
  
  After the fight, there is a scene.  When you have control again, go west,
and then south at the intersection.  Keep going south and at the next inter-
section, go west.  In the next area, go forward for a scene.

:2 Associations


Switch to Ryu

:::Ryu now has control of the Aura Dragon transformation.

::Cliff
  When you regain control of the two, follow the path out.

::World Map
  Go to Sarai.  At one of the bends in the road an ? will appear(always in
the same place).  Go in.

::  ? 
  The northern ledge has an Aurum on it.  If you take the side exit to the
south, it will open up a fishing spot(River Spot 1).  You don't have any gear
yet so ignore it for now.  Go back to the World Map.

::World Map
  Go to Sarai.

::Sarai
  There will be a scene and you will be asked to make a choice.  No matter
what you say, you will part with Nina and be able to move around on your own.
You can buy some fishing stuff from the item shop under the tarp all the way
to the east.  When you're ready, go to the north end of town where there are
a couple of buildings and a monkey man standing outside one of the doors.  Go
inside the door he is near.
  You can buy a lead ball from the frog-type man in the corner for 158z, or
talk to the merchant from the crater where Nina found you.  The person you
want to talk to is the guy at the bar eating.  Buy him some food to start you
first mini-game.
----------------
::"Food Share"::
  The object is to get his happy gauge up by buying him food and drink.
Just alternate between the 2 types of food and drink,  buying him food then
drink is the easiest way to go.  Serving him the same type of thing a lot
will make his happy gauge go up slower, so make sure you keep alternating.
  He will give you an item based on how high the food and drink bars were
before the happy gauge went all the way up.
  2 Antidotes
  1 Panacea
----------------
  Once that's done there will be a brief scene.  When you go out, Nina will
be there.  Talk to her and choose the first option.  Now go over to the inn
(it's south of the town entrance).  The guy is standing near the water bottle
just outside the inn.  Choose to ask about Sandflier parts and you'll get the
next mini-game.
----------------
::"The Price is Right"::
  You have to guess how much the guy wants.  Depending on what he says, you
might have to guess again.  If you want to cheat, give him 123z.  If you
guess his exact amount, he will give you a Ginseng.
----------------
  He'll tell you to go outside town and look for a merchant.  Leave town.

::World Map
  Stop at the ? area you come across other than the path to the fishing spot.
There will be a man in the oasis, talk to him for the password.  Leave.

::Sarai
  When you enter town, if you didn't talk to Nina when you left the tavern,
there will be a scene.  Head to the tavern again and talk to the barkeep.  To
get to the back room just go to where the stove is and through the little
flip-thingy.  The cupboard near the barkeep has 40z in it, so get that then
go through the door.  After the scene, check the cupboards for a Power Food,
then leave town.

::World Map
  Go to the newly opened place south of Sarai(Valley).

::Valley
  In the Valley you will fight Mage Goos and can learn Burn from them.  It
might be better to have Ryu learn it so you can start doing combo magic.  You
can also learn Blind from the Scorpions.
  Go east up the iron pipe next to you,  further east there are 8 croc tears
under a cloth.  South from there, turn the handle to the right so you can get
the chest containing 200z.  Go back and turn the handle to the left twice so
you can go through the path.  Once you go back and past the rudder, go down
east, then down the plank(you might need to rotate to see it), and then into
the ship.  Flip the switch up the stairs to lower the anchor then go up the
ladder on the other side of the wall to get a Brass Helm for Ryu.  Go back
out and get on the anchor to go up.  Go into the shed at the far end and talk
to the old guy.  He'll loan you a dog and shovel for 25z each, for the next
mini-game.
----------------
::"Buried Treasure"::
  Ya gotta dig for stuff, if you use the dog, he'll find items for ya, 2 at a
time, otherwise, just go around digging.  To find the items search:
- Where the barrel and the left part of the ship cross(if you make a line
  going down left from the barrel and down right from the ship fo ship
  parts.
- Up and to the left of the previous one one step for scraps.
- One step to the right off the plank is a Sage's Staff.
- If you go one step to the right from the tip of the ship you can get a
  Glass Shard.
- There's a Glass Shard up and to the left 3 steps from the entrance.
- If you stand at the tip of the ship, there is a Molotov down and to the
  right one step.
You can get infinite Iron Scraps here, from same place all the time.
----------------
  When that's done leave the Valley.

::World Map
  Go back to Sarai

::Sarai
  Enter the tavern.  There will be a scene, then a boss with just Nina.

Boss: Joh
HP: 1200
- You can learn Burn from him.
- Just keep using Sever on him, he'll die after you use is about 5 times.
- He may be a summoned spirit, but he is not undead so don't use heal on him.
- Using Blind helps if you have it on Nina.
Win:
EXP: 100
Zenny: 0
Items: Aurum

  After the fight, there will be a scene.

::World Map
  Go to where the fishing spot road is(or just head right) and enter the ! to
watch a scene.  Once you're back on the map, head to the newly formed line to
Chamba.

::Chamba
  Go inside the building with the machines on top near the town entrance for
Life Sandals.  Back outside, go north to a big house, then east up the nearby
stairs.  Walk on the mat to talk to the old man.  Go down the stairs and into
the big house, and talk to the person next to the fireplace.  Either choose
to wait or go out and re-enter.  Watch the scene, then go in the building to
the southeast.  The manillo has a weapon for Ryu, which you should get, and
the Cupboard near him has 2 Panacea in it.  Talk to the people inside, then
go back to the big house, where Nahb is waiting.  There will be a scene, then
Ershin will join you.  Well... sorta...  Anyway, go inside the hexed area.
NOTE: I recomend taking the Red Cape off Ershin, since that will increase her
                                                             agility greatly.
::Hexed Chamba
  Go south at the first intersection/roof, and take the southern path to the
east for 3 healing herbs.  Now take the west southern at the intersection and
follow the path, going up the ladder at the church type place.  Go east at
the first intersection and follow that path for a chest with 300z and then
go west for the next area.
  Follow the path and watch the scene.  You will now control Ershin.  Go down
the stairs and then switch to Ryu with [Select].  Go around the roof top and
stand on the crate so Ershin can go through the other one.  Switch to Ershin
and go past the crate.  At the intersection go west, then up the ladder and
get the chest with a Molotov.  Switch to Ryu and Nina, walk off the crate,
then switch back to Ershin and stand on the crate so Ryu and Nina can now go
over it.  Switch to Ryu and Nina again, and once you're across go east at the
first intersection and through the passage for a Waistcloth.  Go back to the
other area, then south to the valve.  Switch back to Ershin, then go back to
the intersection past the first crate and go north, then south, then west and
you should see the other valve.  Switch it and watch the scene.
  The next area is pretty much straight-forward.  Just keep going until you
get to the next part.  You now get to fight another boss, the Skulfish.

Boss fight: Skulfish
HP: 2500
- Nina's Heal spell can combine with Ryu's Flame Strike(Aura skill).
- It's undead, so healing spells hurt it.
- It uses Venom Breath a lot, which poisons people, so undoing the poison is
  a waste of time.
Win:
EXP:   429
Zenny: 291
Items: Antidote, Fish-Head

  After the scene, go west up the ladder and then down the next ladder to get
out.  Watch the scene, then exit the area.

::World Map
  Go back to the Crash.

::Crash
  Watch the scene.

::Dreamland
  Go up either the northeast or northwest staircase.  If you go up and around
the path there will be two doors to the north.  The west one has an Aurum in
it.  Keep going and up the stairs.
  The next path is also straight-forward, keep going until you reach a three
way room with a staircase and a curtain.  Check the cupboards for an Aurum.
Go through the curtain and watch the scene.  When you go past the curtain,
there will be another scene.

::World Map
  Go back to where Chamba is and then head left to Kurok.

::Kurok
  Follow the path to meet Rwolf, the first master.  Apprentice to him if you
want to and then continue.  Take the northern west path for a deep diver in a
chest.  Next, take the southern west path, and keep going west at the inter-
section to get to the exit.

::World Map
  Follow the new path to Dam.

::Dam

NOTE: Puspool enemies become hard and take more damage if you hit them with
      fire first, and also leaves more exp.

  Watch the scene.  The path is pretty straight-forward, just keep going
down ladders to the next area.
  Take the west path and follow it to the exit.
  Go down the stairs and ladder and follow the wooden path to the flat with
a canopy over it.  Watch the scene then go back and talk to the guy with the
tube around him, near where you jumped across the mud, and he'll give you the
key.  Head back up the ladder and stairs and follow the path back to the
ladder where the sluice control room is.  Flip the switch and watch the
cinematic, and then head up the ladder back outside.  Now go up the first
ladder then head east and onto the sluice gate.  Once across, go up the
ladder nearby for a chest with a Short Sword.  Go back down and west to where
a ladder is to the south.  Follow that path to the doorway.
  Go to the next sluice control and hit the switch.  Watch the scene for the
next mini-game!
----------------
::"Spin It!"::
  You have to spin the wheel and then start the machine, simple, right?
What you have to do is make 360 degree rotations on the D-pad(using analog is
a lot easier).  You can turn either way, but what you generally want to do is
turn slowly a couple times then speed up.  The pitch will get higher, and
after a while you'll see a ! over Cray's head, which is when you hit Circle
to close the gate.
----------------
  Head out the door to the south to get a chest with 2 Vitamin, then head
back up the ladder and go back across the wooden bridge to where the Short
Sword was.  From there head right across the second Sluice gate.  Once across
head up the ladder nearby for 2 swallow eye.  Now go back down the ladder and
head east to a doorway.
  Follow the path down to back outside.
  Go down to the woodwork and down the ladder, then hit the blue switch to
lower the wood-bridge.  Now go back to the place with the overhang and you'll
get a sequence.  Now head back to the other side and press X on the mechanism
and you'll get another sequence.  When prompted, press X a couple times to
get a scene after which you will be back outside on the world map.

::World Map
  Go up and enter the ! area.

:: ! 
  Pay 100z for a song about Dragons, or 10z for a song about Tadpoles.
Either way you'll eventually have to hear the Dragon song, so go for that
one.  Afterwards, there will be a scene.

::World Map
  Go to Kyria

::Kyria
  There are traps all over the place so watch your step, unless you want to
see Ryu get hit by all of them ;).  Go across the bridge and go in the hole
the chicken is circling.  Get the chest with 400z and then put Cray in the
lead to push the barrels out of the way.  Go back across the bridge and talk
to the "pet" for a fight with a Bee Troop.  If you use only magic to kill it,
it will drop a Bronze Shield.  To get into the mayors house, fall into the
hole behind the house and take the ladder up.  There is a Fish-Head in the
bookshelf next to the parrot.  Talk to the parrot and answer the second
option(no time), then the second option(no), then the third option(no), then
the fourth option(not really).  Now you can ask where the mayor is.  If you
need to rest go into the house next to the one with a blue top and talk to
the lady in the kitchen.  When you're done exploring, leave town.

::World Map
  Go to the Woods.

::Woods
  Just keep following the path, you can't to much else.  Along the way there
will be a tree with fruit in it, have Ershin bump it for some free Apples.
You may want to get some as they restore 100 HP each.  When you're done
picking apples(or you have 99), keep going.  There will be a guy blocking
your way, so talk to him for a scene and an apple.  Follow the sign east to
the next area.
  There are a couple of places where you can fall into the well, but they
also get in your way.  What you do is from the well there is a patch of
flowers, with a little hill going up to the east.  Follow that until you find
the cage trap.  Next to the trap there will be a hole to fall in, go in for a
chest with 4 Healing Herbs.
  Once you're outside the well, put an apple on the stump directly to the
East of it and follow the footprints to an area with an Earth Ward on it.
  For the next chest, go south from the well to where there is a bell trap,
and a hill.  Go up the hill and over to the treasure chest trap.  If you want
the chest stand under it, it contains a Pointed Stick(for Nina).  Now go
across the broken bridge and then down the small hill to the north.  There is
a small break in the trees to the east right after the tree that is sticking
out from the rest.  That path leads to a small area with a chest containing 8
apples.  Go back to the trap and go south past the stump to a hole.  Fall
down for a Aura Ring.  Out of the well again, go up the hill to the east to
the trap and then down the hill going west, then through the area where the
broken bridge is.  Now head through to the next area.
NOTE: You can leave an apple and watch a scene to see where to go if you want
      to, but it will tell you to go to the same place.

  In here keep going across the jumps all the way to the top.  When you get
there, go across the waterfall for a Wisdom Seed.  Now finish going up to the
next area, but heal all your characters first.
  In the next area watch the scene, then fight the next boss.
Boss Maman:
HP: 3600
Attacks:
Body Press: Very powerful attack vs. one character, also stuns.
Rock Blast: Lvl 1 Earth magic against all.
- He's got quite a few HP, so cycle Nina between the front and back rows to
  get healing spells in.
- You should have Ryu transform and use Flame Strike on the boss, then cycle
  him to the back to regain AP.
- He's fairly strong against Earth Attacks so don't use those.
- You also might want to have Cray cast his assist spells on some of the
  party.
Win:
EXP: 1500
Zenny: 450
Items: Apple, Flame Punch

  After the fight. watch the scene.

::World Map
  Go to Kyria

::Kyria
  There will be a scene.

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Just a brief scene.

Switch to Ryu

:3 Missing Princess


  On your way out, Cray falls in a trap so make your way out and then back
over to the path and inside the mountain.

NOTE: Most enemies in here are weak to fire, so use Ershin equipped with her
      Flame Punch to make life easier.

  This place is a maze, kinda.  First follow the path and go across the water
to the other rock area for a chest with a Water Bomb in it.  Now go back and
follow the water to the north, and keep going until you get to a place where
you have to jump across the deep end, this will lead to the next area.
  At the intersection go north for a chest with an Ammonia, then back down to
the other pathway down to get to the next area.
  Go along the path to the water, up the first stairs, and then up the stairs
to the North, which lead to a jump.  Get the chest with 500z and then go back
to the stairs and go North where the rock sticking up is.  Keep going up to
where the next area is and go in the hole in the wall.
  Just keep following this path until you get to the ladder, which leads to
Synesta.

::Synesta
  There is an inn in the center.  To get to it, head west from the well to
the arch-way then north, and the inn is the tall building with the stairs to
the door.
  If you leave town, a path will be made from Kyria to Synesta.
  Make your way to the orphanage right next to the well, and talk to the Nun
standing near the stairs.  When you leave you'll see a scene.  Talk to the
nun, then the kid, who will be the next mini-game.
----------------
::"Tag"::
  He'll run around the town and if he sees you he'll go off in the other
direction.  He does have a pattern though.  He'll run around the outskirts of
the town in the same circle.  What you have to do is go in the opposite
direction and when he sees you he'll turn around.  Follow him to the walkway
on the outside of town with a lot of turns, you can take the turns short and
cut him off on one, since he always takes the turn close to the buildings.
  Another way to catch him is to go to the archway north of the inn where the
monkey guy with a stick is standing and wait for Chino to go by(he won't see
you) and catch him when he does.
----------------
  Once you catch him you'll go back to the orphanage, watch the scene.  You
now have to play hide and seek with the kids.
----------------
::"Hide and Seek"::
-Talk to the small kid playing with his toy near the collapsed wall in the
  orphanage to get number one.
-Go east, under the archway near the orphanage and well, for the second kid.
-The next kid is under the opening where the town entrance is.
-The next one is on the stairs next to the entrance that lead to the walkway.
-Next is the kid who is hiding down the stairs near the well, and behind the
  house with the guy in front of the door.
-The directions for the next kid are a little odd, so just go to the inn and
  the kid is up the stairs.
-Once you get her go back to the orphanage and talk to the sister.  Chino has
gone to the cellar, which is at the stairs where the guard is.  Make your way
over there and talk to the guard.  He'll get thirsty, and when the water lady
comes talk to her.  He'll leave his post to go get some water.  When he does
this you can get by him to go down the stairs.
  Most enemies down here are weak to fire, so keep using Ershin.  The mice
will use Snap, which you can learn.
  Keep going down till you get to a hallway with doors.  The first one has a
door with an Ammonia in the northern cabinet.  Go through the hole at the end
of the passage.  Down the stairs you will find a messed up bar.  Go across
the wrecked furniture, and check the cabinet behind the bar for a Protein.
Exit from the bar and in the next place check the cabinet at the top of the
stairs for 80z.  Keep going and you'll come to a long stairwell.  At the
bottom you will se Chino inside of a cell.  You need to get the vase out of
the way first though.  In the next cell there is a bag with raptor claws for
Ershin, but keep the Flame Arm equipped for now.  Go out the end and up the
next set of stairs to another prison place.  Go to the far end cell and step
on the wooden part of the floor to go down to Chino.  Talk to him and you'll
go back to the orphanage.  Now the mini-game is over :)
----------------
  There will be a scene.  Afterwards go to the house with the bodyguard and
talk to him, you now fight him.
Boss: Kahn
HP: 3000
Attacks:
Focus: Increases Power
Shout: Stuns all enemies.
- You can learn Focus from him.
- He's relatively fast so plan ahead.
Win:
EXP: 1000
Zenny: 0
Items: Ginseng

  There will be a scene afterwards, then you will have to go on a quest.
Talk to the guy standing with his animal at the town entrance, and then leave
town.

::World Map
  A path will open to the Hide Out, choose to go there, but along the way go
into the first ? you get.

:: ? 
  Watch the scene.

::Hideout
  You'll wind up at the Hide Out, where you have to catch the thief, aka
mini-game.
----------------
::"Get Him!"::
  You can move the barrels to cut off his running away with Cray.  Go to the
east barrel first, and move it so that its just beyond the edge, then move
the next closest barrel to right to it little and above, and the last one
next to the first one to trap him.  Now lead him over to the top and your
trap, and you'll catch him.
----------------
  After some dialogue, you will have control again.  Go back into the Hideout
and talk to Stoll again to get him as a master.  Head back to Synesta and
talk to Marlok.  After more dialogue, you have to go to the Sandflier Wharf,
so leave town.

::World Map
  The path will open to Wharf.  If you stop at the ? about half way to Wharf
there will be a sign in there.  Read it and exit via the North-East corner
and you will get another fishing spot.  Now go to Wharf.

::Wharf
  Inside the Wharf, talk to the big guy with the white tank top on, and
you'll get your first job.  Yes, it's another mini-game.
----------------
::"Interior Design"::
You need to move all the jars to the sign in the North End, and the barrels
to the South End sign.  You also have to kill all the old stuff, and the
faster you go, the better your reward.

  The easiest way to do this is to break the cracked barrels near the sign,
    then have Cray push the good one on to the platform.
  Break everything else in this area, then go back to where the entrance is,
    and around it to the other side.
  Break all the barrels and push one jar on top of the jar platform.
  Break everything else and you're done.

  Remember that when you break an old barrel with Triangle or not
running fast, a pair of roaches will attack you.  If you break it by dashing
into it from a distance, you will not fight.  In the interest of saving time,
it is better to break by bash.

  If you want to get the most points, there is a pattern you can follow.
  First go to the jar next to the exit and push it down.  Now switch to
    Ershin and break the old barrel next to the sign, then the one along the
    wall near the sign, and the one on the jar loading platform.
  Now switch back to Cray, run around to the other side and push the barrel
    that is next to the jump spot on the crates forward to against the wall
    on the jar platform.  Now push it over to the middle spot behind the sign
    for barrels.
  Run over to the jar that you pushed down from the entrance and push it in
    front of the stairs.  Run around the dark crate and push the jar over to
    against the sandbags.  Run around the crate again and push the jar so it
    is just before the crate with a jar on top.  Now push it against the
    other crate that is there so it is directly south of the jump spot on the
    crate leading to the one with a jar.  Push it against the wall and then
    to behind the jar sign.
  Push the other jar near the sign next to that one, to the south of it on
    the platform.  Now push the jar near the crates onto the platform, next
    to the sign and the other jar.
  Once that is done, push the barrel(the only one left on the lower floor)
    against the crate with a jump spot and a plank on it(there should only be
    one of those).  Now push it into the crate that has a jar on it, then
    against the crate leading to that one.  Now push it forward until you
    can get around it and push it on the barrel platform.  Make sure to
    leave the last back spot on the line with the other barrels open for the
    last barrel.
  Now go up the stairs and around to the crates with jump spots on them(don't
    worry about the other barrel yet).  Jump across and push the jar down
    the east side.
  Go back around to the lower area, and on the way push the last barrel down
    and into position.
  Push the jar so that its just beyond the crate leading to the one that had
    the jar.  Run around the jar and go between the plank and jar(it can be
    done) to behind the jar.  Push it out 1 space then run back around and
    push it until it hits a crate.  From there just push it onto the platform
    with the others, and you're done!

  You get 1800 for putting all the barrels back and extra depending on how
quickly you went.
 0:00-2:00 - 1500 pts.
 2:00-3:00 - 1000 pts.
 3:00-4:00 -  500 pts.
 5:00+     -    0 pts.
----------------
::"Crane Man"::
Your next job is to load the sandflier.  Moving left and right on the D-Pad
swing the crane, moving up shortens it, and moving down lengthens it.  Also
hitting Circle without a crate makes the arm go down, and hitting Circle with
one makes it lower the crate.  Personally I find this easier using the normal
D-pad instead of the analog stick.
Get the container next to Cray, and move it over to the spot on the ship out
lined with a blue square, and drop it.  You get more points if you drop it on
the light blue square, so aim for that one.  Also try to allow only 10-15
seconds for each barrel.  You've got 3:00 so work fast!  It's better to let
the crane steady itself a little so you can see where it will land, then
lower it down.  You can get up to 2000 points for getting all of the crates,
and more depending on the time remaining:
  Every second is worth 100 points, and depending on the 10 second display it
will be worth more.  From 50 - 55 seconds, each second is worth 300 points.
After 55, they are worth 200.
:30 - :39 500
:40 - :49 1000
:50 - :54 2000
:55 - :60 3000
(I could be wrong about this)
----------------
  After this is done, there will be a scene.  You will get an item based on
how well you did:
Straw
Spoon
Fork

  You'll see some scenes and then...

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Save if you want and go out.  Leave the hut area to continue.
  The path doesn't have any branches so go on.  At the bottom there will be a
scene, followed by a boss.
Boss: Khafu
HP: 20,000
Attacks:
Eldrichflame: Fire Breath attack
Firewind: Lvl 1 Fire + Wind Magic
- He uses Fire magic, but is weak to Water, so transform into Astral and use
  Frost Strike on him, or use Eraser for some massive damage.
- Once your HP gets low, just use Frost Strike, since Eraser won't deal equal
to it.
Win:
EXP: 22000
Zenny:
Items: Fire Ward, Ambrosia.

  There will be another scene.

Switch to Ryu

::Kyoin
  Watch the scene, then head to the next area.
  The inn is the place to the north with the yellow overhang, and it's free,
so feel free to use it.
  Go up the stairs to the "Causeway", which is really a teleporter.  Inside
the first room go in the opening west of the entrance.
  Go up the stairs to get back outside.
  Step on the big thing with a red roof to get to the next area
  Go in the opening.
  The first part of the path is straightforward so go through.
  In the next area, go in the room on the south, right after the branch goes
off to the north, and search the cabinet on the west wall for 3 Healing
Herbs, then go back out.
  Go up the stairs.
  In the next part, the first door to the north has a Glass Domino, get it
then go back and in the nearby southern door.
  In here just go around and up the next set of stairs.
  Now you will find yourself in a room with an elevator.  Ignore it and leave
through the east exit.
  Step on the red lift to go up to a platform with the gateway.  You get to
watch a scene, then try to run through.  Watch another scene and then fight a
boss.
Boss: Ymechaf
HP: 6000
Attacks:
Whirlwind: Wind Attack vs. front row.
- Use combo magic against it.
- Combos with 3 or more hits will knock it off balance.
- When it is off balance it will take more damage.
- Don't forget about transformations with Ryu.
- Cycle people who have little AP left to the back row.
WIN:
EXP: 2000 Exp
Zenny: 0
Items: Aurum, Ice Punch

  Watch the next sequence and when you have control again, get on the
platform.
  Inside the room you can either take the elevator down to the first floor or
go down the stairs for items.  This place is a mirror of the one on other
side, except that the items are different.  The third floor chest has 2
Ammonia, and the second floor cabinet has a Vitamin.  Outside the path leads
to the world map.

::World Map
  Head over to Astana.

::Astana
  In here, the Armor/Item Shops and Inn are up the stairs on the south of the
barrier.  Talk to the people to learn about the Aqueduct, then leave town.

::World Map
  A new path will open to the Aqueduct.  Go there.

::Aqueduct
  Go up the wooden plank, and then the ladder.  There is a chest with a
Ginseng so get that and go up the next ladder.  Go across and talk to the guy
to go down.  Go through and cut the rope with Ryu's sword.  Go across the
jump and up the ladder to the end of the path for a chest with 500z.  Now go
back down and across the jump, then to the other side of the pillar for a
ladder, then go across and into the water.  There will be a scene.

::Astana Base
  The first door to the north has a Life Shard, other than that go up the
stairs.  By the way, notice how the music here kinda sounds like the music
from Resident Evil?  Keep going along.  At the next intersection check the
cabinets for a Magic Shard, then go through the curtain to the north.  You'll
see the same scene as before.  Walk across behind the curtain slowly(just
walk don't run) and go through the door for some scenes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 2: THE ENDLESS

:4 The Broken Sword


::Ludia
  Check the bag for an Aurum and go down the stairs.  You'll meet Scias, who
will join you when you exit through the door near him.
  In the house next door there is a merchant down the stairs with some new
weapons.
  Head east into the castle and you'll get some scenes, leave, get more
scenes, then leave town.

::World Map
  If you go north from the first ? area, a ? spot will appear(the ones for
random fights).  Go in.

:: ? 
 Read the sign, then exit West for another fishing spot.

::World Map
  Go to Shyde

::Shyde
  Talk to someone under the first archway to trade the Lead Ball for a Bronze
Ball.  Leave town.

::World Map
  Head down to Wynchwood.

::Wynchwood
  There are a couple enemies here worth noting, the NutTroops will use Double
Blow every other round(you can learn this). and the Wyd's will transform into
Firewyds if you cast a fire spell on them(these have better Exp).
  Follow the path.  At the first intersection head west for a chest with 3
Healing Herbs in it, then continue along the south aiming path.
 In the next area, you'll get a scene, and lose Nina(in a rather funny way, I
might add).  Keep going and you'll get more humorous scenes.  You now have to
find Nina.
  First, go on the ledge to the south and follow it to a jump, which goes
over to the place with the trees in the middle.  Now go around the trees and
take the next jump for a bag with a Magic Shard in it.  Go back across the
jumps, down the little hill, and follow the path, keeping south.  Go across
the jump and have Ershin hit the tree that is right there.
  You get more scenes, followed by control of mini-Nina!  Head up the small
hill between the eggs and then head around to the south with a jump down.
Walk towards the hole in the tree and watch.  Now for an odd boss.
Boss: Sparrow
HP: 500
Attacks:
Feeding Time: AP is cut in half
Pinder: Nothing
- Use Cyclone once and you'll win.
- If you just defend, it will run away after a while.
Win:
EXP: 250
Zenny: 100
Items: Bird Drop(wha?), Wooden Rod/Bamboo Rod(if it ran away)

  Head across the tree to a branch with vines hanging, and go down those
vines.  More hilarious scenes to follow(with Nina ending up in an interesting
position ;)).
  Head north, there is a dark green tree you can hit with Ershin for berries
or get stung by a caterpillar(actually you can do this with just about every
tree in here).  Keep following the path and you'll leave the woods and be
back on the World Map.

::World Map
  Go to Worent

::Worent
  Inside there is a Shop/Inn, the big house to the north with the guy waving
his bat around.  Head east through town to get to the Chief's house(recognize
the big guy on top?), and go in.
  Watch a scene.  Before you leave, go in the door to te south.  Down the
stairs in the basement is a bag containing ManlyClothes in it.  Leave the
house and go down the stairs, and you'll have to fight Kahn, again.
Boss: Kahn
HP: 3500
Attacks:
Focus: Raises Power
Shout: Stun vs. all enemies
Tiger Fist: Attack vs. all enemies
- Transform into the Aura(what else?)
- His only good attack, Tigerfist, will only be used once.  After that he
  won't have the AP to cast it.
- After that, he's a pushover
Win:
EXP: 2000
Zenny: 0
Items: Ginseng

  Afterwards, there will be a couple scenes.  Don't forget to rest at the Inn
to get your HP/AP back.  You can get Una as a master now, she's up the ladder
inside the Chief's hut.  Talk to the small lady behind the southern houses
near that... thing floating around.  You'll get a Whelk to ride.  Leave town.

::World Map
  Go to the Plains.

::Plains
  You'll get a scene and then you will be on the plains, and on the whelk!
Since Ryu will be the only one in your party, this is a good place to level.
You'll fight mainly NutArchrs, which shouldn't be that much of a problem.
  Head east, which is the direction you start off going.  Eventually you'll
    run into a big rock.
  From here rotate left until you are going northeast(the red needle should
    be pointing to the upper left), then start going forward again.
  Sooner or later you'll see a white line going up from the field, head
    towards that, it's where you're going.
NOTE: If you go east until you leave the plains again, you will wind up at a
      shrine, there's nothing to do here yet though.
NOTE2: If you leave the plains without going into the camp(i.e. you wind up
      at a cliff or forest area), you went the wrong way.
Note3: If you're still having problems finding her, please refer to the
      Compass explanation in the Basics section and/or the FAQ, which has a
      slightly more detailed description of how to find her.

  You'll see some scenes, then go into the tent, followed by more scenes.
When you wake up go outside for more scenes.  Talk to her again and choose
the third option(the one about the sword).  Exit and you'll automatically go
back to the world map.

::World Map
  Go back to the plains for a !.

::Plains
  Watch the scene, then choose to leave the plains.

::World Map
  Head back to Worent.

::Worent
  Talk to the old guys in the big house again.  Now leave again.

::World Map
  Go back to the plains.

::Plains
  Go east until you reach the big rock, then head south.  You'll see a
volcano with smoke coming out of it, that's where you're headed.

NOTE: For the next area, a lot of enemies use fire attacks and are weak to
      water.  Put Ershin in the front ranks with the Ice Punch equipped.

Mt. Glom
  Inside the volcano, head north to a jump that leads to a bag with a Fire
Ward inside.  Then go east through the small crack in the wall.
  When you get to the next area there should be rocks in front of the
entrance.  There will be  path to the east, leading up a hill to a north
exit.
  In this area, there will be platforms on the lava.  These platforms will
move when you get into a fight.  Pick a fight near the entrance and after the
platforms move go to the one to the east that should have come closer.  Walk
over it to get to a chest with 600z.  Now go back on the platform and pick
another fight to make the other platform come down, and the one you are on go
toward it.  Once you are on that one, pick another fight to raise the
platform back up.  Get the chest with 3 Vitamins and then go north one
platform, pick a fight on this and you should be taken to a cave opening.  In
the cave is a chest with a  Drill Punch.  Head back out and make your way
east across to go in the cave opening.
  In here go across the bridges and then inside the house for a scene.  Check
the cabinet in here for an Aurum.  Go down the ladder then out back into the
cavern.
  Go across the bridges to get a chest with 4 molotovs.  Go back to under the
house.  Exit through the dark passage, then follow that to the world map.

::World Map
  Head back to Wynchwood.

::Wynchwood
  Go to the place where you met the fairies(after Nina was shrunk) and talk
to the little glowing dots to meet a fairy.  You'll be transported to the
Land of Dreams, aka Fairy Village.

::Faerie Village
  After a chat head into the open area and talk to the sleep bubbles.  They
will be bosses.

- None of these have anything to steal.
- They are all undead, so you can use healing spells(not items) to deal
  massive damage.
- To increase the chances of finding the item after battle, fight them in the
  order of oldest to youngest(go down the list from Chkom then go back to
  Bokta after the others are defeated).

Win:
EXP: 5000
Zenny: 1800
Items: Magic Shard

  After this fun you watch a scene, then you get the Fairy Drop, and go back
to your world.  Leave to the World Map.

::World Map
  Head back to the old man's house in the volcano(it will be on the map).

::House
  Give the smith the drop.  You'll get a King's Sword, which is the same as
the other one that Ryu broke.  Leave the old man's house.

::World Map
  Head back to Ludia.

::Ludia
  Head to the castle for some scenes, then head back to the house you were in
earlier, head up the stairs, choose to wait, and......

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Just a brief scene.

Switch to Ryu

  It's night-time so get ready to make a raid on the jail!  Leave the house
and head to the Castle, the orange Manillo will sell items/weapons if you
need to check your equip.  When you're ready you have to fight guards before
they can call for help.  Nina's Cyclone will kill them with one hit, so don't
worry about that.  If you don't win in the first round, you will have to
start from the beginning again, but the guards you've already knocked out
will stay that way.
  Talk to the guard guarding the north passageway, fight him and then go
through.
  Go east up the stairs and fight another guard.  In the room behind him is a
chest with an Artemis' Cap.  Go back and then up the stairs to the
northwest of the fallen guard.
  Just keep going up and you'll wind up with Cray.  Head back down the stairs
and out of town.

:5 The Wind Dragon


::World Map
  Go to Worent.

::Worent
  With Cray in the lead, talk to people(you don't have to, it's just nice to
see the different reactions people give to Cray).  Head back to the hut with
the old guys.  Talk to them then leave town.

::World Map
  Head over to Tarhn's place.

::Tarhn's Camp
  Watch some scenes, then when you wake up, head out and talk to Tarhn, then
leave.

::World Map
  If you went to the shrine before, then go there on the map.  If not, enter
the Plains.

::Plains
  Go east all the way past the big rock until you get to the other side, the
shrine is there.

::Shrine
  Go inside the Shrine an put the Jadestone on the alter(just press X on the
alter then answer yes).  After a scene a passageway will open up.  Go in.

NOTE: If your characters run low on HP, the best way to heal is to find a
     fight with one or more Catrpilrs, kill all but one of them in one round,
     which is easy with Scias, Ryu, and Cray, then put Nina in first, have
     her heal the party member, then have whoever is left kill them.  Nina
     should have more than 5 CP, so just keep using the 5 AP she gets per
     round to do the healing.

::Inside the Shrine
  Go north at the first two intersections.  At the third, go west for a chest
containing 500z.  Go back to the intersection and head east, east again,
south, and follow that to the exit.  In here there is a puzzle to solve.  You
have to turn the lasers by having Cray push the handle behind them.
----------------
::"Light Show"::
  You lose HP every time you hit a laser, so watch out.
  Go down the stairs near the entrance and push the Green laser so the beam
is heading north.
  Now  run around and push the Yellow laser so it's pointing south.
  Run back around the Green laser up the stairs and down the stairs to the
    south.
  Run along the Red laser to the staircase for a chest with 4 Silver Tops.
  Head back down and push the Red laser so it shoots south.
  Go to the Yellow one and push that so it shoots east.
  Push the Green one so it shoots east.
  Now go back to the red one and push that one so it shoots north.
  Now go in the room for a chest with a Light Bangle.
  Go out and push the Red laser.
  Go up and around to push the Green laser, then the Yellow one.
  Run back past the Green laser and up the stairs, then go down the northern
stairs.  Go east to the hole in the wall, and from there go up the stairs.
You'll be in a shack.  You can talk to the man behind the rugs to trade the
Bronze Ball for an Iron Ball.  Head out and go behind the shack for 2 Ammonia
and when you're ready, leave the shack and you'll be on the world map again.

::World Map
  Go to Ahm Fen.

::Ahm Fen
  There's only one way to go so follow the path.  When you get to the lower
part(walking in the water) head west first for a chest with a Baby Frog in
it.  Then head back and past where you came down to another plank that goes
to a bridge, this leads to the next area.
  You may notice the big snake here, don't worry, it won't attack you.
Stepping on the broken parts of the bridge will make the snakes move, and you
can use the snakes as bridges.
----------------
::"Snake Way"::
  Go south at the first intersection and up on the plank and hit the broken
part twice to move the snakes.
  Go north from the broken part and walk along the snake to the next bridge.
  Go along this one and then down the slope on it to get to a chest with a
    Scale Mail(You will trip the snakes along the way).
  Now hit the broken part of that bridge 4 times.  Walk across the snake and
    go down to the swamp level, then northeast to find a bridge back up.
  Hit this spot 3 times, go across the snake and hit the next one 3 times,
    then down the bridge to get a chest with 3 Life Shard.
  Now hit the crack one more time, go across the snake to the platform and
    walk across this one to the next area.
----------------
  From here exit to the world map.

::World Map
  If you go into the ? to the east, you can check the cabinet for a Vigor
Seed.  Go north on the map to a ! spot.

:: ! 
  Watch the scenes and a Fairy will appear.  Say yes(you don't have that much
of a choice) and you will get the Fairy Village!
  From now on you can go to the Fairy Village by camping and talking to the
head fairy near the edge of the camp ring.

NOTE: Once you get 5 faeries, you can go back to the ? house near Ahm Fen and
        get the faerie there to be a master.

  After you are done with the Faeries, go back to the world map.

::World Map
  Go into Wyndia.

::Wyndia
  Certain people will have different reactions to you if Nina is in the Lead.
The Manillo will sell you some new fishing gear, if you've been keeping up
with fishing.  In the big fancy house to the south, the butler in the dining
room will buy silverware from you(remember the item Marlok gave you?) with
Aurums.  Also check the cabinet in the kitchen for 2 Swallow Eyes.  Most of
the houses in Wyndia have a cabinet with items, so make a search of the town
for some good stuff!  You'll run into Momo from Breath of Fire 3 if you go
into the big Windmill.  She's a master(go figure).  When you're done having
fun, go east to the big wall, up the stairs, and on the lift to get to the
castle.
  If you go in the near door, and follow the paths, you will get to a chest
with a Ring of Wind.
  Head back to the entrance and go north into the other castle entrance.
  Talk to the guards with Nina in the lead and you will be permitted to go
further.
  Go down the stairs in the middle of the room, then head west outside.  Go
in the north door to get to the dungeon.  Talk to the prisoner and you will
be prompted to trade the Iron Ball, and you will get a Brass Ball.
  Head back up to the room with the guards you talked to, and check the
cabinets in the rooms on the south wall for a Wisdom Fruit and a Soul Gem.
  Now go in the room on the north wall(there should be a guard there).  There
will be a couple of scenes, then leave Wyndia, and begin your journey east.

::World Map
  Head to the Kasq Wds.

::Kasq Wds.
  Inside go along the path and talk to the blue-gray Manillo walking around
for another fishing spot when you leave.  Now head north to the next area.
  Go on the log directly next to the entrance and go across for a chest with
600z.  Now go back to the other side and head north.
  Go up the hill and then go over the wooden bridge.  Over here there is a
log mini-game, but it's not required.  I'll cover it anyway :)
----------------
::"Log Rider"::
  Just walk in the direction you want to go, there are only two ways to go,
anyway.
  Go on the first log to get to the next one going perpendicular to it and go
on that one until you are next to the grassy area in the middle.
  Get off and go across to another log, take that one to a landing with 2
Weather Vanes on it.
  Now go back 2 logs and take that one the rest of the way to another log
going perpendicular to it.
  Ride that log to the ledge you can get off on, get off, and walk around to
get the chest containing Long Boots.
  Now get back on the log and ride to the corner ledge so you can get off on
the shore and then get back on another log.
  Ride this log all the way to the next one and then ride that one to the
near-by shore.
----------------
  If you're done having fun on the logs, go out thru the northern exit.
  In here go west for a chest containing a Magic Shard then head back east.
  Follow this path to the next fork and take the one leading northwest.
  In the next area take the path heading north and go in the house.  There
will be a scene.  Take the treasure chest for an Aurum and check the cabinet
for 3 Flattops.  Now leave the place, you'll automatically go to camp.

::Camp
  There will be a chat, then Scias will leave.

::World Map
  Head back to Wyndia.

::Wyndia
  Go to the castle and talk to the king.  After your chat leave the room and
go out to the north.  Go in the room with the windmill above it and head down
the stairs.
  Go along the passageway.
:Dungeon
  In this place, Ryu will deal more damage with the King's Sword than with
most others you have available at the time.
  Keep going east until the path splits and you can't.  Then go north in the
darkened area for a chest containing a Soul Gem.
  Now head back south and follow the fans.
  In the next room watch the fan and wait for it to blow north, then run to
the northeast for 3 Swallow Eyes.  This may take a few tries.  Once you have
those wait for the fan to blow northeast and run north to the next area.
  In here wait for the moving bridge to come over to you and then get on.
  Get on the next one but wait for it to go to across from where you start so
you can pick up a chest with a Balance Ring in it.
  Wait for the bridge to come back then take it to the next one.
  Take this one to the next cliff and go in the opening.
  In the next area, you have to wait for the wind to stop moving so you can
advance.  Do so and work your way up, hiding behind stretches of rock that
come out of the edges(just as long as something is in front of you) to
prevent yourself from being sucked to the opposite end of where you want to
be.  Along the way, pick up the bag with 4 Healing Herbs in it.
  Once you get through here, you will be in a chamber that has the Wind Flute
in it.  Get it and make your way back to the entrance.
  Yep, all that just for the Flute.  When you leave watch a scene then leave
the castle and head for Pung'tap.

::World Map
  Go to Pung'tap.

::Pung'tap
  Watch the brief scene then head up the stairs and into the doorway.
  The path in here is pretty straight, but after about 2 screens there will
be a hall with 2 exits.
  Take the south one and follow that all the way to a room with a chest
containing a Homing Bomb.
  Head back and take the other door to the north.  In here go up the stairs,
you'll end up back outside for another mini-game.
----------------
::"Leaping Heroes"::
  You have to jump from platform to platform, moving with the wind.  To jump,
stand on the edge of a platform and press the D-pad off the ledge or X.  This
is actually quite simple.
  Wait for the wind to die, then jump over to the southern platform.
  Now, wait for the wind to come up and keep pressing left so you will be
carried up to the platform above on the north with a chest containing 600z.
  Jump down to the northern platform below, then wait for the wind and jump
to the south platform across from the chest.
  Go out and up the stairs, then in the opening at the top.  Wait for the
wind, then jump up.
  In the next area, keep going up and you will wind up at a chest with a
FightingRobe in it.
  If you go up again, you will get to the end.
  Jump up, but before you go through the exit, jump back down the way you
came.  You will be on a platform on the east wall.
  Jump off this when the wind dies and you will go down to a platform with a
chest containing 2 Power Foods.
  Jump down again and then work your way back up to the very top again.
----------------

  Now go through the opening, and head over to the gondola.  You will watch a
scene then you have a fight three grunts.  You get 2600 Exp, 500z, and a
Molotov/Eye Drops/Knockout Gas(nothing good).  Scias will be in the next
fight.  He won't be on your team, but he will fight with you, and heal your
characters with Multivitamins(when they get low on HP).  Scias is also
invulnerable for this fight.
  After the fight you can get the same stuff as the last fight.  You will get
to watch a neat scene, followed by another scene.  Scias will be back in your
party now, with all the equipment he left with.
  Head down the path and you will be back on the map.

:6 Mysteries


::World Map
  Go to the only place available at the moment, Ice Peak.

::Ice Peak
  Go along the path, but when you get to the slope going up, take the little
way to the side of it for a bag containing a Vitamin.  Go up, and at the top,
head on the upper path to a cave with a chest containing an Icicle.
  Go back to the lower path and go in the cave down there.
  Follow this path all the way to the other side and back out into the open.
  In the next area, put Cray in the lead and push the snowball.  This could
be considered a mini-game I guess.
----------------
::"Snow Plow"::
  Push the first ball out of your way.
  Now go down and push the next one into the ravine so you can cross it.
  Across the ridge go north up the hill and push the snowball at the top(go
    all the way up) down to allow crossing to a chest with AsbestosArmr in
    it.
  Go across the snowball and back up that hill and push the other ball down
    to the south and then down west to the gap.
  Push the ball near the bottom up so it is next to the southern edge of the
    jump.
  Now push it east and walk across it to get a chest containing 500z.
  Head down the path and you're on the map again.
----------------

::World Map
  Go to Chek.

::Chek
  The inn has a bag with an Aurum in it, there is a shop with some new
weapons, and east of it there will be a door with a kid next to it. Go in,
there will be a scene, then you will get control again.  Walk out the door
and get a scene.
  When you wake up there is a brief scene.  Go up the stairs to where Ershin
is.  You'll get another scene, and end up inside the last place you'd expect
to be.

::Dream World 1
  Run along the path, taking the jumps.  When you are back down, take the
south fork to get a chest with a Water Ward in it.
  Go back and take the northen route this time.
  Follow that to the next area.
  You can use the glowing crystal to move the big thing.  Just keep moving it
until you can get all the way up.  Once up, talk to the green thing for a
scene.  After that, talk to a pillar and get ready for a fight.  They also
heal for 600 after every round.

Name      Strong    Uses
-------------------------
Umadap    Water     Wind
Yeleb     Wind      Fire
Agiel     Fire      Earth
Azeus     Earth     Water

- Each one has 1400 HP.

- Dont use attacks from their elements, that will heal them.  Physical
  attacks like Double Blow and Shining Blade are the easiest way to win.

  After the fight you get 10000 Exp, and 1 of each of the following:
    Electrode        Earth Ward
    Molotov          Fire Ward
    Weather Vane     Wind Ward
    Water Bomb       Water Ward

  Now watch a scene.  Go all the way back and to the real world.  You have to
go past the chest to get back, so if you missed it the first time, get it
now.  Back in the real world, there will be a scene and then its...

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Just a brief scene then...

Switch to Ryu

  When you can move go to the house where you found the old lady and watch
the scenes that follow.

:7 Prophecy


Switch to Fou-Lu

  You can actually control him again!  Sort of...  You'll wake up in Sonne
Village,  go to the town exit for a scene, then...  You guessed it!

Switch to Ryu

  There will be another scene...

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Watch another scene that explains some stuff, then.........................
Fooled you!  You regain control of Fou-Lu.  Leave town, walk west along the
path for another scene, then head over to the 3 farmers gathered together and
then follow the path near them to the woods.
  At the first intersection go west for a fight.
Boss: Papan
HP: 13000
Attacks: 
::Stone Pillar - Lvl 2 Earth magic
::Body Press - Attack + Stun
- It's not all that much to worry about.  Just attack with Frost Strike and
  he'll go down in a few rounds.
- You can steal an apple from him.
WIN:
EXP: 10000
Zenny: 750
Items: Wisdom Fruit, Apple(if you didn't steal)

  Now head back to the village for a scene, or go South to get to the world
map.  If you go in a ? area, there are some skills you can learn from enemies
but watch out for Bilbao's, their Blitz takes a lot of HP off you.  There is
nothing you can do here anyway, so just head back to the village.

Switch to Ryu

  Go back in where Ershin is and say yes when you're ready to go back in.

::Dream World 2
  It will be slightly different from last time, but the concept is still the
same.
  Walk along, taking the side jump for 2 Knockout Gas'.
  Keep following the path and at the next intersection, go north for a chest
containing ManlyClothes.
  Head back to the main path and continue on to the house/temple.
  Watch a scene.
  Leave when you're ready to.

::Chek
  Watch the scene then leave town.

::World Map
  Go to the newly opened ? .

:: ? 
  Watch a scene, then leave to get back on the map.

::World Map
  Now head up to Sinchon.

::Sinchon
  Go in the cave for another dungeon.
  In the second area(the one after the stairs in), go across the north bridge
and then northeast to the doorway.
  In this area, go west all the way to the door to get back to the other room
for a chest with 2 Swallow Eye in it.
  Now go to the other path and follow along that one.
  At the next branch take the lower path and press X on the eye at the north
end of the room.  This will start a 30 second timer, so run back and go to
the upper path and jump along the pillars.  The first chest has 3 Dragon
Scales in it, then continue and jump to the platform with the doorway, then
get on the western pillar and wait for it to go down.  Go in the back room
for a chest with 2 Magic Shards in it, and another one with a Soul Ring.
  Go out the door on the other door, and jump down.
  Hit the eye again and do the same thing you did last time, only don't go to
the pillar, stay on the platform.
  Go through the door, then go along until you are back outside, and you will
get a scene.

Switch to Fou-Lu

  After the scene you will have control, so head out and go find Mami.  She's
up the hill on the first intersection in the field, and you will get a scene.
If you go back into town and talk to Mami, she will give you a Rice Ball.
After you get that leave town.

::World Map
  Go up to Mt. Yogy.

::Mt. Yogy
  The boulder will... well... go away.  Go up the path, at the first
intersection go on the northeast path to get up to the top, then make your
way into the volcano.  I recommend stealing(have Ryu learn Pilfer so Fou-Lu
can have it) the Magma Armor from the Lavoids, since the Fire protection will
help out a lot in the area to come.  Also if you got a Fire Ward from the
last boss Fou-Lu fought, equip that as well.
  Anyway, inside, go west to get to the next area.
  Just follow along the path until you get to a scene, then a boss.
Boss: Marl, Klod, Bellwyd

  There is a scene, then head back to Mami's.  After the next scene, walk to
the town entrance, you will get another scene.
  Head back into the house for yet another scene.  Head to the oven and
press X to go in, there will be more scenes.

Switch to Ryu

  Watch the scene, you now have your first Breath Attack!  It's also dragon
hunting time!  Sort of...
  Head back through the cave to the other side, when you leave you will get a
scene, and gain control of Ershin.  Head outside and watch another scene,
followed by a fight.  More scenes, more fights.

::World Map
  Go back to Chek.

::Chek
  Watch the scenes.  Head out of the house for another scene, then leave
town.

::World Map
  Go north to the ? spot on the map.
  At the first intersection head west, then north for a Soul Gem in a chest.
  Go north and take the lower path to get a Wisdom Seed.

CHAPTER 3: STREAMS

:8 Awakenings


NOTE: You now have control of another dragon type.

Switch to Fou-Lu

a monster will follow you(it likes you:)).  Don't worry, it won't attack.
Leave the woods to the south.

::World Map
  Head to Sanctum.

::Sanctum
  Watch the scene then go in the cave.    Get the Crystal for another Dragon
Type.  Keep following the path to the exit.  When you are back outside, go
down the slope to the world map.

::World Map
  Head to Soma.

::Soma
  At the four-way intersection go northwest for a SuperVitamin, then head
south to the next area.  Just follow the path for a scene.

Switch to Ryu

  Watch the scene.

::World Map
  Go back to Chek.

::Chek
  Back in Chek, talk to Abbess and watch a scene.  Ursula will now join the
party, talk to Ershin, and she will come back.

NOTE: If Ryu uses the Kaiser Dragon form, it will be Berserked and you will
      not be able to control it.

::World Map
  Go to Mt. Ryft.

:Mt. Ryft
  Inside go west at the first intersection and jump across the rocks for a
chest with a Rocket Punch in it.  Go back over the rocks and head along the
path going next to them and go south at the next intersection leading outside
to a raft.  Get on the raft for a mini-game.
----------------
::"The River Wild"::
  You have to make it down the river in one(or more) piece, every time you
hit something you lose a piece, when it gets completely destroyed ya gotta
start over.
  Know when it's smart to go for bags, don't go for it unless you know you
won't hit a bank or if you just don't care about losing pieces :)  Also you
might want to consider breaking the raft before you get to the waterfall so
you can pick up a chest with 3 Fish-heads in it.
  This is more of a reaction game, so I can't really help you out here.
Sorry :(.
  You get a bonus based on how many pieces you have left of your raft.
----------------
NOTE: You can go back and play the raft mini-game as many times as you want.

::World Map
  Head to Shyde.

::Shyde
  If you go up the stairs and around the top, to an area with a bridge, you
will find the boy who explains game mechanics.  Ask him about shift and you
will get the ability to teleport to places on the world map that you have
walked over since getting the ability.
  Go to the room underneath and talk to the blue man.  Go back outside and
watch a scene, then go back into the room and talk to the blue Manillo again.
  Press X on the flier to get in.
----------------
::"Speed Racer"::
  Left and Right turn it, Circle accelerates, X Brakes.
  The dots on the track are mounds, which you can use as shortcuts if you go
fast enough.  When you jump from them, move the D-pad/Analog stick in circles
and you will do tricks, just make sure you land with the bottom of the ship
down.
  It is also better to save time if you press X to brake before a turn.  This
will help you maintain control of the flier.
----------------

::Kyoin
  Head up to the gateway and talk to the guard, then head back to the
sandflier for a scene.  Talk to the guy with the bag for another scene, then
leave.

::World Map
  There are a couple of things you can do first however.
- If you had anyone apprenticed to Rwolf, then you probably have enough combo
  hits to get the next skill.
- You can get the Mud Dragon's help by going to the ? just north of Dam where
  you met him the first time.
- For the Grass Dragon's help, head to the great Plains and talk to Tarhn.
  Then go onto the field and head east until you see a flying white dot, aka
  a bird.  Chase after the bird and you will find a glowing dot, aka singing
  bird, now chase that one.  It will lead you to the Dragon.
- If you head back to the Crash(your old sandflier), you can trade the Brass
  Ball for a Tin Ball.
- If you head to the house with a fairy in it, she will become a master if
  you have been keeping up with the Fairy Village side-game.
- If you have been trading the Balls, then you can go back to Synesta and
  get Marlok as a Master.
- After you get the power of one of the dragons, you can go back to Chek and
  get Abbess as a master.
- If you have those items in your inventory that say "Looks like it could be
  used to make armor", then head to the smith in Mt. Glom and he'll make
  armor out of up to three of them.

  If you head to the Shikk region, you will have the mini-game again, then a
scene.  The guy will give you a Silver Top as thanks.  Leave the area if you
want, or go back on the sandflier mini game.

::World Map
- If you go from Shyde to Shikk or Shikk to Shyde, you can get the Sand
  Dragon's powers by taking the jump going south to an isolated area of the
  sandflier map.

  Head to Mt. Giga once you get the dragon.

::Mt. Giga
  Get on the Gondola and head down.
  Get the bag for 800z, then go across the jump.
  Head north at the fork, then head down.
  Go up the hill and go on the landing, then jump down to the crystal for
another dragon type.
  Jump down then head up to the top of the slope to another gondola.
  Take the upper path to get a bag containing a MultiVitamin, then go down
the lower path.
  At the bottom go east for a chest with a Weather Wand in it, then head
back.  Go up the slope next to the one you came down on to get to the path
that leads on.  This will bring you back to the world map.

::World Map
  Head up to the Checkpoint.

::Chkpoint
  Talk to the big guy with a purple cap and watch a scene, then you have to
fight with just Cray.  They are not hard at all, one attack usually kills
them.  You get 1400 Exp, 182z, a Void Sphere, and Dynamite when you win.

  After a scene, push the cart facing the gate with no brakes in front of it
until it hits the guards, then push the one near the rock to over where the
first one was.
  Now go back to where the chest and entrance are and push the cart near
there over so it's between the chest and roof.
  Go up the ladder near to the roof of the building and jump off the south to
the chest with 3 Ginseng in it.
  Now go back up the ladder and jump off the north ledge and then jump down
and head out.

::World Map
  Head along the path and go in a ? area that opens up half way there.

:: ? 
  Take the side exit to open up a ? spot on the map.  Go in there and you
will be able to get the Tree Dragon's help.  Go back to the map.

::World Map
  Go to Shikk.

::Shikk
  The shop will have some new weapons, but they are pretty heavy.
  If you go down the slope where the kid is running around the Manillo, then
in the door near there, then down the stairs, you will find a man who will
trade the Tin Ball for a Copper Ball.  The cabinet upstairs has a Water Bomb
in it as well.
  Go down the stairs in the shop and talk to the sailors at the bar.  Leave
town.

::World Map
  Head for Fane.

::Fane
  Talk to the guy and he'll let you through.  At the first intersection head
down to the path covered in water.  Go along that for a chest with 5 hangers
then head back to the intersection and go west for a bag containing 2 Ammonia
then head back to the intersection and go east.
  At the next one go down the slope and in the cave.
  Follow the path that goes west.
  Take the southern cave hole for a Wetsuit, then take the northern one and
get the blue ball on the floor.
  Go back to the first area and throw the ball into the well type thing.
  Now head out and go to the upper cave.  Watch the scene, then go back to
the world map.

::World Map
  Go to Shikk.

::Shikk
  Talk to the sailor again and watch the scene.  Then you get a mini-game!
----------------
::"Balance is de Key"::
  You have to knock the sailor off the mast.  If you press X, you can jump.
Jumping on his head stuns him.  Then you press Square to build up speed and
run into him.
  Just jump on his head then run with Square into him to push him off.  When
you jump on his head, you'll bounce off to the other side of him, so jump
from the side closer to the edge.
  If Iggy hits you, you lose 50 points, if you fall off, you lose 100 points,
so watch your step.
  The easiest method to winning is to just stand on the edge of the mast and
wait for him to charge at you.  when he gets close enough to the edge, jump
straight up and hopefully you'll land on his head and bounce onto the mast.
Run into him to win.
  If you go fast enough you will get a time bonus.
----------------

  Talk to the guy again for a scene.  After another scene you will fight with
just Nina and Ursula.  Don't be afraid to use AP, that's what it's there for.
Watch another scene, then have another fight.  Watch another scene, then talk
to Zig for a scene.  Talk to him again to set sail.

::The Boat, on the High Seas

  Watch the scenes, then head down the stairs at the aft of the ship.  Check
the cabinet for a Warbler then make your way to the hold for a scene.  Head
back up topside for another scene, then a boss... Sort of...
Boss: Kahn
HP: 12000
Attacks:
Focus: Raises Power
Shout: Stun vs. all enemies.
Flex: Poison all combatants.
- You can steal Ginseng from him.
- You can learn Focus from him.

WIN:
EXP: 12000
Zenny: 0
Items: ManlyClothes.

  After the fight, watch the scene.

:9 Fools and Men


  Head topside and talk to Zig.  Watch the scene then talk to Iggy.  Watch
the scene that follows.

::Cove
  Go into the ship.  The will-o-whisp will turn red when the next step you
take in that direction will fall out on you, so watch it closely.  Take the
eastern plank.  On the next plank intersections go West, West, North, East,
North, East, South, then East for a chest with 3 Burnt Plugs.
  From the chest go North to the second of the two planks going East and go
on it, then North, then West four intersections, then South, West, South,
South, West, then North to a chest with a Ring of Fire.
  Now head back the way you came(head South, then East, North, North, East,
North, East), then head North, East, North to the platform with a ladder.
  Head up the ladder, then past the steering wheel to back outside for a
chest with 1500z.
  Back inside go on the bridge east of the ladder.  From here, go East,
North, and West twice for a chest with 2 Panacea's in it.
  Now head back east and go in the cave for a boss.
Boss: Glebe / Loam
Glebe
 HP: 18,000
 Attacks:
 ::SummonMinion - summons 2 minions either Loams or ????s(chest).
 ::Snap - attack: lowers defense.

- You can learn Blitz from them.
- Ignore them, after they Blitz a couple times, they will not be a threat.
- You can steal Wisdom Fruit from the Glebe, and a Vitamin from the Loams.
- If you let it create a new Loam, you can steal another Vitamin.
- The above is an easy but time taxing way to get 99 Vitamin's.
- Every now and then he will summon a Treasure Chest instead of a Loam.
- You can steal Iron Scraps from these.
WIN:
EXP: 17000(depending on how many Loams you killed it will change)
Zenny: 13032(again, depends on how many extras you killed)
Items: Light Bangle, and a random assortment of: Aurum, Iron Scraps, Glass
       Shard, Bent Screw.

  Watch the scene, then go back to the ship and go outside to where the chest
with 1500z was.  You can jump off the ship to the rocks for a shortcut back
to the dingy.  Talk to the sailor to head back to the ship.

::Ship
  After the scene, head to the bunks and rest for another scene.
  Head out and talk to Zig on the main deck(the front of the ship).
  Watch the scene that follows, you will wind up in Lyp.

::Lyp
 Jump across the boats to a Blue Manillo fishing.  That's Gyosil, a master,
but only if you have 3000+ pts. fishing.
NOTE: Once you get Gyosil as a master, you will be able to go back to Synesta
      and get Lyta as a master as well.
  There are shops all around the first area if you go on the boats.  The
exit is north from the boats.
NOTE: You can talk to Zig again to take the boat out and get several items as
      well as the Sea Dragon's power.  You will be in a mini-game.
------------------
::"Adventures on the High Seas"::
  You move the ship with the directional buttons, however to make it go you
have to either use the sails or oars.  Oars will use more supplies, giving
you less time at sea, but you can use them anytime.  Using the sails uses
less supplies, but you can't go against the wind, and the wind will sometimes
die down, rendering you stuck.  Press triangle to get off the ship and
explore.  A note on wind.  The direction the gauge say is the opposite of the
way it's blowing.  Get it?  That is the direction the wind is coming from, so
if you want to head North, wait for a South wind to go that way.  Or just use
the oars, but that will use up supplies very quickly.  The lighter colored
arrow to the right of the wind arrow is the current arrow, which tells you
which direction the current is going in, and the size says how fast.  This
will  speed you up if you go with it, or slow you down a little if you go
against it.
- If you follow the coastline you will see buoys with red flags on them.
  One has 5 Water Bombs, another has 3 Water Wards.
- Going south through the rocky path will get you to a red flag with a
  Harmonic Ring in it.
- If you head east for a while to a red flag inside a U-shaped cove, there
  will be 3 bent screws
- If you head to the blue flag, up the screen, you will get a fishing spot.
- The red flag on the same island will have a ManlyClothes in it.
- The island with a small lake on the coast and a rock in the lake is the
  place where you were inside the wrecked ship(Cove).
- If you go to the place where the water is a lighter blue and you can see a
  lot of rocks around it, explore there with Triangle, you will get the Sea
  Dragon's help.  You can find it easily by going northeast from Lyp to the
  cave of wrecked whips, and going northeast from there.  Or go north out of
  Shikk(I think that's the direction... Up and left)
- As soon as you have cleared the peninsula Lyp is on, go Southeast(wait for
  a northwest wind).  When you hit a rock, press X, you will be on an island
  with a chest containing a Divine Helm.  The rock is the one with 3 others,
  making a straight line.
- If you talk to the sailor with purple lips(Kryrik) in Shikk, he will be a
  master if you can make a combo of 25+ hits.
------------------
  When you are done sailing, go to the world map outside Lyp.

::World Map
  Go in the ? area on the map.
  
:: ? 
  There is a furball here, talk to it and choose the second option(give it
food), and keep giving it food until the option is "Still More" or "Thanks
for the food", then stop giving it food.  Apples work fine, and there is a
limitless supply of them in the forest next to Kyria(forgot about it, didn't
you?).  Leave over the bridge to the south.
NOTE: I am not very good at speaking this language(more on that later), but I
      think what the furball is saying is "I don't feel good.  I took the
      medicine but still don't feel good."  Once you give it food for the
      first time, "Fish! That's Fish! Fish good(?)!  That's amazing!"  After
      you feed it enough, "Fish! That's Fish! I've had enough, fish was
      good!"  That is very iffy, as I had to guess on a couple of the words,
      but the general idea is that it wanted food.  You don't have to give it
      fish, normal food works as well, like Apples and Berries.

::World Map
  Go to Jungle.

::Jungle
  Take a walk on the boardwalk, and go east at the intersection.
  When you get to the tree, go east to the plank going down to get a chest
with a SuperVitamin in it, then head back.
  Go up and across the tree to the other side.
  Keep following the boardwalk to get to the next area.
  Go on the bridge until you get to a crossroads, then head south for a chest
with 2 Aurum's in it.
  Go back and head north, skip the jump to the boardwalk.  In the next area,
you do the log rolling again.
  Roll the first one into the next, then roll that one alongside the third in
that area.  Roll this one alongside one to the south, then roll that one
alongside a log north of the one you're on.
  Roll that one to another one and get off for a bag with Toxic Claws in it.
Go back to the south log and roll that one alongside one to the south, then
roll that one into the log which goes ashore.  Leave and you're back on the
map.

::World Map
  Go to Pabpab.

::Pabpab
  Watch the scene.  If you fed the furball in the forest, you will be able to
get in, otherwise, go do that now. (They say something like, "Enemy, bad!  Go
away!!" then the furball you fed says something like "These are friends.  Not
enemies!")  Watch the scene then head to the room outside and across the
bridge.  You can read Beyd's notes on how to understand the furball language.
I'll write them down here in case you're interested.
ain      - during, a period
ishi     - east
kairu    - guide, teach
ko       - here, this

santo    - thanks
sonna    - sorry
taan     - time

  I don't know about you, but a couple of these are growing on me.

  Pukapuka!  Anyway, when you're done talk to the sick guy and then go back
to the hut with Beyd.  After the scene, leave Pabpab.

::World Map
  Head to Lyp.

::Lyp
  Talk to the old man up the ladder at the south end of the village for a
scene.  Talk to Zig when you're ready to head out, you will get control of
the ship for the sailing mini-game again.
--------------------
::"Sailing for the Cure"::
- A blueish red(maybe purple) flag out east is where you need to go to get
  Mozweed for the furball.  It restores the status of one person, so you
  might want to get a few extra.  Use Ryu's sword swipe(Triangle) to cut it.
  You can ut as many as you want.  It's faster to head west out of Shikk to
  get here.
--------------------

  Head back to Pabpab with the Mozweed and head to where the sick furball is.
  Give him the Mozweed(press X on him), watch the scene then head back to
the hut for another scene.  Leave the hut for another scene, then go back to
the world map.

::World Map
  Go to the ? area.

:: ? 
  There will be a small scene.  (She says something like "This is Saldine.
You should go west from here!" then, "You're friends,  Go west here!"
followed by, "Thanks, for helping us. You're our friend.  Things will all
work out!")
  Head west along the flats and at the fork keep going west to get a chest
with 2 PoisonPowder's in it.
  Now take the south path and go along that one.
  Keep following the path west to the next screen.
  Go on the beach and west past the hill to get to a chest with Moon Tears
in it.  Head back and go up the slope.
  Go across the jump to the north and head down the slope before the next
jump.
  Go through the bushes(beware of the red ones, they're thorns) and get the
Crystal for another dragon type.
  Head up the slope and over the jump then north up another slope.
  Go along there, then head back down to the watery area(you may need to
rotate to see it).  From here go west to the next screen.
  There aren't any side-tracks here, so just go along the path to the next
screen and a scene.
  After another scene, head west to another area in a jungle setting.
  Just walk along and go across the water to the next area.  As soon as you
go to where the path get wider, you will get another scene.

Switch to Fou-Lu

  There will be a brief scene.

Switch to Ryu

  There will be another set of scenes, then go to the path west and get
another scene.
  Head west to the next screen and go up the slopes to the next area.
  Walk around here and don't forget the chest for 2 Crab's.
  There is another chest in between the tree lines and under the leaves that
has a Deluxe Rod in it, and you can now fish for food if you go west another
screen.
-------------------
::"Fishing"::
  I'm not going to explain fishing here, that has it's own section.
-------------------
  When you think you have enough fish, head back to camp.
  When you get back, you will get a scene.

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Watch the scenes.  Then head up and stand on the glowing green thing for
another scene.

Switch to Ryu

  Watch the scene then head to the fishing spot.  

Switch to Fou-Lu

  Head east into the castle.
  If you go down the stairs and around the floor, the first door on the north
wall will be a save/rest room.  If you go forward, you will get a scene,
then a boss.
Boss: Kahbo
HP: 19,000
Attacks:
::Flaming Fist - Physical Fire attack
::Mystic Fire - Fire breath attack
- You can steal a Wisdom Fruit from it.
- This guy hits hard with fire, so go for Tyrant of Behemoth.
- He goes before you do, so watch out.
- As a Behemoth, put the Fire Ward on and you will take very little damage.
WIN: 20000
Zenny: 0
Items: SuperVitamin

  Next is Kamyu.
Boss: Kamyu
HP: 29,000
Attacks:
::Simoon - lvl 2 Fire + Wind Magic
::Eldrich Flame: Fire Breath attack
- You can steal a Wisdom Fruit from it.
- Serpent/Peist is your best bet.  It's Waterspout Breath attack will deal
  around 1800-2000 per hit(with 6 hits, that's around 12k damage per round).
- He uses fire attacks, so keep the Fire Ward on.
- Use Wisdom fruit as needed.
- If your dragon HP gets low, you can use an Ambrosia.
- Watch out for Simoon, that deals around 1000 damage.

WIN:
EXP: 30000
Zenny: 0
Items: Ambrosia

NOTE: You can go rest in the save room if you choose to do so.
  Now watch a scene and then press X on the statue to go to the next area.
Go down and along the path.  Go through the guards(you have to fight, they
are very easy though).
  Watch the scenes that follow, then fight again.  You have to transform in
order to beat them, so do that.
  Watch out for the fire attacks.  Astral will work fine here.  Two Erasers
should do the trick.  You'll get 11600Exp for all your troubles.  Continue
on into the castle.  Head forward for a scene.

:10 Levant


Switch to Ryu

  Watch the scene, then head back to camp.  Rest at the blue book, then watch
a scene.  Head over to where you found Ursula the first time and watch a
scene.  You'll be back on the map.

::World Map
- If you head north you will get another master.  I won't say who it is, but
    you'll laugh when you find out.
  Head to Koshka when you're ready.

::Koshka
  The shop has some really good items in it so check it out.  Nothing else
here, so leave.

::World Map
  Go to Shan River.

::Shan River
  Pull the switch to bring the lift over and get on for a mini-game.
-----------------------
::"Gondola Man"::
  After you are on the first gondola, the instructions will come up.  Simple,
really.  Just press X to move it.  If you want to get off before you hit
something, let go of X and get off with the D-pad/Analog stick.
  From the first one, go over and keep going across to the next area.  Go
west over the jumps and south over the tree.  Get the nearby bag for 1000z,
and the chest southwest of the tree hidden under branches to get a chest with
Titan's Boots in it, then go south again, then east to get back to the area
with the gondolas.  Get on the nearby gondola and go forward to hit the log,
then ride that to the chest with an Earth Ward.  Get on that gondola and ride
it back to the entrance, then ride gondolas back to the tree and go around to
the gondola again.  Wait for the first log to go past then keep going.  Hit
the next one and ride the log.  Now you can use it as a bridge to get to the
chest with 2 Aurum's.  Now go back to the tree and around... again...  This
time, dodge both and go all the way across on the gondola to the exit.
------------------------

::World Map
  Head into Chiqua.

::Chiqua
  Talk to the blue Manillo at the south end of the dock to get another
fishing spot.
  Then go talk to the purple guy east of the entrance to town for a scene.
  You have a choice of getting one of these three:

:Fish - You only need to get a total of three of these, and you can mix and
          match between them(i.e. 1 of each, 2 of 1, 1 of another, etc you
          get the idea).
 MartianSquid - Can be found in all 3 of the Lake Spots.
 Salmon       - Can be found in River Spot 2(also in spot 3, but you can't
                  get there yet).
 Sea Bream    - Can be found in Ocean Spot 1 and Saldine Spot.

:Relics - Ruins near Koshka
  This one is the most complicated, but I suggest you do it anyway because it
has another dragon type inside of it.

  Go to Koshka. 
  Talk to the guy with red shirt and purple pants and pony tail to find out
where ruins are.
  On the World Map a new place will open up(En Jhou).
  Head into the ruins.  Follow the path and go up the stairs.
  Put Ershin in the lead and break the discolored part of the east wall, you
need to get a running start for it.
  Head north up the stairs, then go down the stairs in that room to the next.
  Jump south and then follow the branch up and go north to a room with 3
Wisdom Seed in it.
  Leave and go into the room next door.  Have Ryu cut the chords, but watch
out, the purple one poisons everyone in your traveling party.
  Head back to where you jumped across to get to the branch and jump across
east.
  Follow the path to go down the stairs, then another set to the south.
  Go down the ladder, and then down the set of stairs to the west, but only
that short set, so you can get to a ledge and jump down.
  Take the next 2 southern jumps.  Now jump across the little expanse and
you should be on the ledge against the southern wall.
  Head down the stairs to the west for a chest with 2 Magic Shards in it.
  Now go back up the stairs and head east to another room.
  Follow that path to get another Dragon Crystal.
  Now go back and across the expanse, then head to the ledge and jump down.
  Go back up the stairs to the ledge, go down west, then take one jump south,
then go west again to get a chest with a WardingStaff in it.
  Jump the rest of the way down and then head back to the beginning where you
went up the stairs to the north(vs going across a jump to the east).
  This time head east across the jump and go through the door.  One of the
chests has 3 Antidotes, the other has an Aurum in it.  Once you've gotten
them, leave the ruins.

:Pottery - Koshka
  Talk to the store owner and ask him to make a jar.  Come back after you
waste a lot of time fighting, doing side stuff, working on masters, etc.  But
you need to kill a lot of time.  A looooooooooooot.  I think around 5 hours
of game time.  He'll sell it for 500z when it's finished.

  Once you have done one of these, he will tell you how to get to the capital
and then, if you have it, offer to trade the Copper Ball for a Silver Ball. I
don't recommend giving him the treasure from the ruins, that's the Flawed
Gem Crystal.
  The easiest way to do it is to ask for the pottery, waste some time then do
the ruins, then go back and the pottery should be done by then.  The cheapest
way to do it would be to get the fish.
  Anyway, after you give him something(if you have more than one you can
choose which you want to give him by saying no to the ones you don't want to
give him) leave town.

::World Map
    Head down to River.

::River
  Inside, Cray has to move the boxes in the river.
  Go across and down the stairs.
  Go across the jump and then push the crate.
  Go over the crates to the other side.
  Go up and around.
  If you make your way to the other area, get the bag by going up the ladder
then back down the other side.
  Flip the switch on the nearby control panel to make the floodgate go up and
walk across it.
  Go back down the other side and press the control panel to make it go back
down.
  Now head east to across another small floodgate, and there is a guy who
will talk about things with you.  If you answer "Dragons", "Yes", "They all
look different", "Like grass and rocks", then he will tell you how to get to
the quarry.  If you talk about traveling, say "Across the sea", "We've seen
dragons", then answer the way you would have the first time.
  Go east past him to the edge and take the jump out into the middle, then
push the crate.
  Flip the small gate to lower the water, then again to close it.
  Head across the box-bridge and then east and hit the switch to raise the
big floodgate.
  Head over to the other side of it and go to the next area.
  Go across the jump and then back to the previous area to get the chest with
an Armored Vest in it.
  Go back over the jump to the floodgate.  Everything will have reset and you
can go down the nearby ladder to a chest with an Atomic Punch in it.
  Go back up the ladder, over to the next area, across the jump, up and over
the crate, and you'll be back on the world map.

::World Map
- If you go to the ? on the map that is down, then left, you can get the Rock
    Dragon's power.
  Head to Pauk.

::Pauk
  Go into the red tent and watch a scene.  Talk to the woman again then leave
town.

::World Map
  A ? area will appear, go there for a mini-game.

:: ? 
----------------
::"Chicken Run"::
  You have to get the brown chicken into the pen.  If you get other chickens,
you get more points.
  The chickens will run in the same direction you do, and if you run around
to a side, they will change direction accordingly.  If you go far enough away
they will stop running and go back to a walking pace.  You get 100 points for
each chicken you get in the pen and 2000 points for Tak.  If you leave them
alone, the little chicks will always run in the direction of Tak.  You can
use this to lure them near the pen.
  You also get a bonus depending on how many extra chickens you caught.
There is no time bonus for this game.
  Getting all of the chickens will give you a free and fairly easy 6900 game
points.
----------------
  Back in town, if you got more then just the brown chicken, the little girl
standing by the chickens will give you an item.
  Go back to the red tent and watch a scene.
  Leave town again and you will see some new places open up on the map.

:11 The Path Ahead


::World Map
  Go into the ? before the Tomb.

:: ? 
  You will be in the forest you were in as Fou-Lu at the beginning of the
game.  If you head to where he first met Yahm, you will see the hill Fou-Lu
jumped up to escape.  Go up this hill but watch out for damage from the
thorns.
  If you go to a path to the west, you can find the Wind Gem Crystal for
another dragon type.  There is a bag in a little break in the bushes to the
north with a SuperVitamin in it.  Also, in this area, you will fight a lot of
GoldGang enemies.  If you kill them using only magic, they drop 10000z.  This
is a good place to get cash for buying stuff.
  If you leave through the southern exit, you will get another fishing spot.
After you've done all this, go back to the World Map.

::World Map
  Go to the Tomb.

NOTE:  Any items you got as Fou-Lu will now be gone.

::Tomb
  Go back the way you came out as Fou-Lu.  When you see a path that looks
like a dead-end, go through it(it isn't a dead-end) for a bag containing a
Wisdom Fruit.  Once you get back to the Tomb area, go behind it to find a
chest with an Ambrosia in it.
  When you click on the stone guardian, you will get a scene, then a fight.

Boss: Won-qu
HP: 32,000
Attacks:
::Frost Breath - Water breath attack.
::Sanctuary - Cancels all support magic.
::Sleep - Sleep vs. front row.
- Having Blizzard Mails on your party is a good idea.
- You can steal Moon Tears from him.
- He casts Sanctuary occasionally so don't bother with Magic that doesn't
  deal damage directly.
- You can learn Sanctuary from him.
WIN:
EXP: 30000
Zenny: 0
Items: Cupid's Lyre

  If you are running low on HP/AP, it might be a good idea to exit, rest, and
come back.  Whenever you're ready, head down into the Tomb.
  Just keep going down stairs, it's all you can do.
  When you get down to the bottom, keep going to get to a chest with a
Vitamins in it.
  Now go back and step on the platform to go down.
  Go through the door and press the switch and continue on.  Mini-game time!
----------------
::"Movers'R'Us"::
  You have to move the blocks to form a path.  X goes back, O goes forward.
  Move the red block next to the east platform south one space.
  Move the next closest red block one space north, then go to the side and
    move it one space east.
  Move the red block furthest east 3 spaces south.
  Move the blue block furthest west 2 spaces north.  Go to the east side and
    move it 4 spaces east.
  Move the other blue block you can move from that side 2 spaces west.
  Go back to the other side and move the last blue block once space west.
  Move the red blocks near the platform so that they form a line, you should
    only have to move the middle one one space north.
  Move the red block furthest to the west east, so that it lines up with the
    hole in the path next to the other red blocks.
  Now run around and move it north into position.
  The first platform has a Bead on it, and the chest is an Electrifier.  Head
back to the previous room.
----------------
  When you get back to the area with the platform, the bead will crumble,
but open up a new passage.
  Go down to that area, and then go up the ladder, then up to the next area.
  Go north at the first intersection, then west at the next, watch the pillar
go down then continue on past it.  Go down the ladder to the next room for a
mini-game.
----------------
::"Blocked Passages"::
  You walk around on the block, but if you step on the red eye, you will lose
some of your Max HP.
  From where you start go east one step.
  Then north 2, then west 2, then another 2 north.
  Get off and get the bead.  Get back on and go north one step, east one,
    north one, west one, south one, east one, north one, west one, south one.
  Rotate the screen.  The red eye should be facing north.  If not, repeat
    until it is.
  Now just roll to the chest for 5000z.
  To get back without getting hurt, line the block up so it is directly north
    of where the bead was.
  Now go north one, then west one, then south until you can see that the red
    eye will be the next step.
  Now go east one, north one, west one, then finish going south to get back
    to solid ground.
----------------
  Head back to the lift room and a pillar will go down, breaking the bead.
  Go up where the pillar was and make your way to the opening in the wall.
  In here take the northwest path at the intersection to get a chest with
2 Napalm in it.
  Go back and take the east path to another puzzle, but it is too simple to
need any special explanation.  Just go up the stairs and get on the block(you
may have to wait for it), then take the stairs down to the floor level, then
go back up with the next block.  The exit is up there.
  In the next room, watch the scene, then go across the bridge and read the
sign for a boss.

Bosses: I, II
I HP: 10,000
II HP: 10,000
Attacks:
::Powder - Poison vs. front row.

Eye in it.
  Go along the level path and through the door at the far end.

the west side for 5 Dynamite.
  Now go back up and then go off the south jump to get a bag with 3 Wisdom
Seed.
  Go up the ladder again, then north to the next ladder which leads outside.
  Go along this path into a shrine-like place, and get the chest with a
Dragon Tear.

on the map.

  Now go back and inside the castle.
  Go east to the glowing green thing on the floor and watch the scene.

5F:
  Go down the stairs and around to the save room.  Put Ershin in the lead and
bash the cupboard that has the key on top, then go to the stairs leading down
and use the key to unlock them.  Go down.

4F:
  At the first intersection go east, then north, then in the nearby door.
  There should be another door near the one you are in, go in that to get to
a room with a bunch of bookshelves.
  At the back of the eastern side of the middle row is an Ivory Dice.
  Head back to the previous room and go west to get to another door.
  Keep following this path(don't go down the stairs) and you'll wind up in a

go down the nearby stairs.

room to the exit to the west.
  Go all the way west and up the small staircase to the doorway.
  In the next room get the bag with an Earth Ward and go back east up the

6. Fishing

  Fishing in this game is a little different than it has been in the past
games.  I'll try to explain how it works though.

Section TOC:
6-A: Basics
6-B: Hints
6-C: Fishing Spots
6-D: Fish
6-E: Fish Finding
6-F: Fishing Gear
6-G: Manillo Shops
6-H: Fish Uses as Items

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6-A: Basics

  When you enter the fishing place, the menu button will bring up the fishing
menu.  From here you can select your Rod and Bait, as well as see info on
them about what type, range, etc.  You can also run around in here, like
other places.
  First, choose your gear, when that is done, run around the ponds edge until
you find a place you want to fish from.  Different places will have different
fish types/sizes.  Don't worry if you don't see any fish though, they are
under water and only the shallow ones will show up.  When you see a place you
want to fish from press X.  It is better to place Ryu in a place near deeper
water to increase the chance that you will get a bigger, better fish.
  That will change the point of view a little, as well as bring up a dotted
line going out from Ryu.  That is the direction that you will cast your line.
  Next, press X to bring up a gage that will show a green line which goes up.
That is the amount of power you will be using to cast the line.  Choose how
far you want to cast.  The longer the green line gets, the further out you
will cast.  The bigger fish are usually out further, so remember that when
you're casting.
  Once it is cast, you will see a new gage open up on the right.  That shows
how deep the pond is, and the arrow near it shows where the lure is.  If you
drag the lure along the bottom, you lose it, so be careful you don't do this
accident.  You will also see a yellow box appear in the middle of the power
gage.  That is the "equilibrium box", which is important when you want to
catch a fish, but not right now.  You will also see a distance marker next to
the power gage, which shows how far out the lure is.
  Move the lure around to attract attention.  If you feel the controller
rumble a little, that means that a fish has swam by it(in other words, there
is a fish about to bite).  Eventually, a fish will bite.  When this happens,
you will feel a rumble in the Analog controller(if you have one), and it's
time for the fight to begin!
  Remember the "Equilibrium box"?  this is where it comes into play.  You
have to press X to reel the fish in, but if the Green line becomes Red, it
means you are pulling to hard, so let go of X.  If it is blue, you are not
pulling hard enough, so just hold down X and hope for the best :).  Usually,
unless you are not pulling, it will not go here.  As long as the bar stays
green, you will win in the end.
  There is also a Red bar underneath your Green power bar.  This is the
amount of energy a fish has.  The bigger this is, the more of a fight the
fish will put up.  This will basically tell you how long you are going to be
sitting there.  Once this bar goes down, the fish will usually stop putting
up a fight, and you can reel it in the rest of the way with decent ease.
  When reeling your fish in, if you are near rocks or some other type of
hazardous terrain, the fish might try to hid behind them.  You can help this
by moving the D-pad left and right.  Just make sure the power bar stays green
or you'll lose the fish.
---------------------------------------------------
6-B: Hints

- If you're on a platform or rock ledge, you will be able to cast farther
  than your reels normal max casting range.

- To smooth out the reeling in process, reel the fish in using a zig-zag
  pattern, moving the fish left and right.

- When a fish is either "Thrashing About" or facing in the direction you
  don't want it to(away from you), rotate the D-Pad/Analog Stick to try and
  make it turn around.  This can also stop the green bar from going orange/
  red.  Also letting go of X will usually stop the fish from moving, just
  make sure to keep using the D-pad so the fish doesn't fall off the blue.

- If the green bar is slowly moving to the right and the fish is going away
  from you, let go of X and quickly press it again.  This should get the bar
  back in the middle of the equilibrium box.

- For some reason, the fish have an aversion to hugging walls.

- Casting out as far as you can is not always the best idea in Lake and River
  spots.  Listen to what the in game hints say for ideas on where to cast.

- Look for directions to fish spots in ? areas.  They will appear as a sign
  somewhere in the area.

- Look for rocks and stuff when you cast out.  Hiding behind rocks is a
  common practice for fish that don't want to be caught.

- Once you catch a fish, you can move it with the D-pad left/right.  This is
  useful for avoiding obstacles.

- If you catch ground,  Slowly pull the lure.  Press X, and as soon as the
  power bar goes orange, let go.

- Remember to pay attention to the "Equilibrium box".  The scenery is nice,
  but don't let it distract your fishing.

- Look at how much energy the fish has.  The bigger the red bar, the bigger
  the fish.  You can use this to judge if you rally want it or not.

- If you wind up getting a fish you don't want you can let it go by just stop
  pressing X.  You'll lose the fish, but not the lure.  Make sure you don't
  catch the same one twice though :)

- When you see a crown next to the fishes name in the data screen, that means
  you have caught the biggest fish of that kind, giving you the most amount
  of points for it.

- When you read the sign in the fish spots, the fish further down the list
  are usually harder to catch in that area than others.  If a fish is in more
  than one spot, it may be a good idea to look for it in the spot where it is
  closer to the beginning of the list.

- This isn't anything that will affect your ability to catch fish, but if you
  press L2 or R2 after you press X to choose where you will cast(when the
  dotted line appears), you can view an enlarged version of your bait and
  even rotate it with the D-Pad.  Press Triangle to get back to fishing.

6-E: Fish Finding

  Do you hate how you'll spend hours searching fo a type of fish, only to
draw a blank on everything except the ones you don't want?  Well, each fish
has a spot where finding it is more common than any other place.  I don't
think you need help catching the easier fish, so this is here to help find
the harder to find fish.  For all of these fish, you have to let the lure
drop to the bottom unless otherwise stated.
  I think these are the only ones people have trouble catching, tho if enough
people have problems with some others, I'll add those as well.
  Just remember that no matter how good you are, you're still going to need
a lot of patience for the fish you want to appear.  In other words, don't
expect to get a Sturgeon or Dorado on your first try.  Or second, or third,
or fourth, or... I think you get the idea.

Fish             Most common location
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dorado           The rock near the log to the NE in Lake Spot 2 25m out.
                 Dorado can also be found quite regularly near Barandy, only
                   not as deep under water(about half way down or so).
Barandy          Cast straight out from the dock in Lake Spot 3 about 30m.
Sturgeon         In River Spot 3 stand on the bridge and cast south to the
                   rock about 8m out.
Octopus          In the same place you cast for whales, only the lure does
                   not have to be all the way down to the bottom.
Black Porgy      In the Saldine Spot, there is an indent into the sea right
                   to the south of the sign.  Cast straight out from there

7. Fairy Village

  During chapter 2 a fairy will ask you to help them out.  This will allow
you to have your own village, the fairy village.  You will have to tell the
faeries what to do in order to make the village bigger and get more faeries
in it.

Section TOC:
7-A: Feeding the Faeries
7-B: Building Buildings
7-C: Growing Food
7-D: Jobs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-A: Feeding the Faeries
- Always try to have 1/3 of your faeries hunting.  With this many, you can
  ignore them for a while(or forget as I usually do) and not worry about them
  dying.  If you want to have less faeries hunting you can, but you will have
  to participate in the hunting minigames that appear on the world map as ?
  spots(just like when you go into one to find a fishing spot or have random
  enemies).  In these places you have to kill the animals by doing one of 3
  things.  Using Ryu's sword swipe, Using Ursula's gun shot, or using Ershins
  bash.  With Ershin you can just run into them to score a hit on them, you
  don't have to get next to them and press triangle.  The animals will drop
  either a Loins, Flank, Roast, or Ribs depending on how strong they are and
  how much time it takes to kill them.  The Bearcows will drop Loins if you
  can kill them quickly.  Lambs will drop a Roast.  The dear with 2 feet and
  antlers will drop Flanks.  The purple bird-like ones will drop Flanks.

- There is an easy way to get the good meat from the animals.  If you notice
  that when you change terrain the landscape changes, but the locations of
  barriers will stay the same(basically, they're all the same with different
  scenery).  If you go to the northeast corner of the map, you will notice
  that if you follow the wall, you will get to a corner with a plant next to
  it.  This is a trap since the plant can not be walked around and there is
  only one entrance to it.  Guide an animal into this place and then have Ryu
  kill the animal in here and you will not have do worry about the meat going
  bad or running away.  This is any easy way to get the best quality meat you
  can without going around chasing the animal.  If there is no plant there to
  stop the animal, you can use Cray to push a rock next to a corner to create
  a similar effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-B: Building buildings
  The faeries will clear land and build rooms, but only if you tell them what
to do!  To clear land put faeries in the box with the hammer and saw drawn on
the inside.  As always, more faeries = faster clearing.  Leave for a while
and when you get back, you should see some dirt patches lying around.  Talk
to the head faerie and choose to look at the land.  You can now see an
overview of all the land you have and you can select which ones you want to
build on by moving around with the D-Pad and selecting with X.  After an
amount of time, the building will be completed.  Now you can select a job for
the Faeries to do and put some in to do that job.
  Remember that certain jobs will go up in levels faster if you put them next
to each other.  Item shops will get new items faster when they are next to
other item shops.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-C: Growing Food
  After your village grows a bit, a tree will appear that is a darker green
than all the others.  You can use this tree to grow different types of items,
usually either Berries or Apples.  To have the tree grow, you need at least
one faerie on the green box next to the building box(on the jobs screen).
After that you can choose up to 3 different types of fertilizer to plant on
the tree.  They are:
 Scorched Rice
 Bird Drop
 Rotten Meat

  You can plant other items as well as those, but I haven't been able to get
any results other than the Apples and Berries no matter what I try.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-D: Jobs
  There area total of 10 jobs you can get for your village.  They will appear
as you get more faeries to join the village.  The jobs are:
 Items  - Item shop, will get some very useful items such as Wisdom Seeds.
 Arms   - Weapons Shop, will sell Shaman's Rings eventually.
 Inn    - You can use it as a free inn to get back lost Max HP.  The second
            faerie will tell you some game stats, the 3rd will tell you some
            other interesting stats.
 Search - Send faeries out to look for items.
 Troops - Once you get Faerie Magic from a master, you can use this to
            enhance that magic.
 Music  - They will play the various songs from the game.
 Art    - You can see some of the Capcom art made for the game.
 Aurum  - Will but and sell Aurum, you can use this like the stock exchange
            to make money over a period of time.  Not really useful, but you
            can use it to get Aurum if your supply is low.
 Games  - You can play various minigames with the faeries.
 Bonds  - You can buy insurance to help you stay alive if you die in battle.

7-D-b: Searching
  Faeries will go out searching for items to give to you.  This job uses the
Endurance(Red) bar, so faeries that have a big red bar are the best to use.
There is also a chance that the faerie will die from the expedition.  Higher
difficulty levels will increase this chance.

--------------------------------------------------
7-D-c: Troops
  Faeries in here will increase the amount of damage the faerie attacks do in
battle.  The more faeries you have and the higher the level of the shop will
make the faerie attacks(you learn them from Njomo) do a lot of damage.  The
shops gain one level(up to 99) each time you use Faerie magic, so if you use
Faerie magic 5 times before you visit the faeries again, the shop will gain 5
levels.
FaerieBreath: Heals and restores status.
FaerieAttack: The more faeries you have, the higher the damage.  Vs. All
FaerieCharge: You need 6 or more faeries for this to work.
War Shout:    You need faeries on Troops and a Music shop for this to work.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
7-D-e: Games
  The Games Shop will play different games with you depending on the level of
the shop and the number of Faeries you have.
::Kecak - First Faerie
  The idea is to press the buttons according to what the faeries play, or
when the button circle on the bottom is halfway over the red line.  If you do
it at the exact same time the faeries do, you get a flower, which is more
points at the end.  You can get a prize based on how well you do.
------------
  The second faerie will allow you to rename the faeries/party.
------------
::Rock-Paper-Scissors - Third Faerie
  You play using cards instead.  You pick a card, the faerie picks a card,
then she turns hers over and you find out who won.  If you win, you keep your
card and they lose one and vice versa.  If it's a draw, you both lose a card.
When all of someone's cards are gone, the game is over.  If you win, you get
a point for each card you had at the end.
  There are a total of 4 of each card, so try and judge what the faerie will
play, and look to see what you have.  In normal, you both get 2 of each, but
in random, who gets what is messed up, you might get all 4 of one and none of
another.

--------------------------------------------------
7-D-f: Bonds
  This shop sells insurance that you can buy which will bring all party
members back from the dead if they are killed in Battle, but it will steal 8%
of your zenny.  It will only last about 3 hours though, so you will have to
keep renewing it.  You can also add a premium to the insurance, but these
will also subtract from your zenny.  An easy way to take advantage of the
shop is to keep your total zenny low by buying expensive items(armor/weapons)
so you won't lose as much when you die.  You can stockpile on expensive items
and then sell them later when you need money.

  The Bonds shop will gain levels the more your characters die.  oi.
The premiums are:
Lev. 1 - Health  - Recover and have a Vitamin used on you.  Lose extra 1% of
                   zenny.
Lev. 2 - Retreat - Recover and automatically run from battle.  Lose extra 2%
                   of zenny.
Lev. 5 - AP      - Recover with all AP restored.  Lose extra 3% of zenny.
Lev. 8 - Dragon  - Recover with Dragons restored.  Lose extra 3% of zenny.

  The way insurance works is once all of your characters are dead(all 6) an
option will appear to use the Insurance, you will also have the option of
using the premiums that you currently or previously have had.  If you select
to use the insurance, it will restart the battle with all your characters
restored, but everyone except the last person standing will have their max hp
lowered.

*1 When Bot is transformed with a combo, it will double the amount of EXP it
     has.
*2 To get Protobots to use Sacrifice, do an element combo on them to make
     them transform.  After 3 rounds, they will use it.
*3 - When you attack Legions with melee attacks they get stronger and leave
     more Exp.
*4 The Chopam fights for 4 rounds.  During the first 2 it is invulnerable and
     it will run away on the fourth.
*5 - MorphGoo's will use magic from the element of their color, and are weak
     to the opposite.  They will also teach a skill for each:
        Blue  - Water   weak: Fire       learn: Icicle
        Red   - Fire    weak: Water      learn: Burn, Flame Pillar
        Green - Wind    weak: Earth      learn: Eddy
        Black - Earth   weak: Wind       learn: Plateau
     Also, they will change colors at the beginning of rounds, and also when
     they get hit with magic they are weak to.
*6 - Morphs will have different items depending on what type of magic you use
     on them, and yes, Burn will work: Fire:  Burnt Plug
                                       Wind:  Dirty Filter
                                       Water: Rusty Pipe
                                       Earth: Old Tire
     Also, once you steal from them, you can cast another type of magic on
     them and steal again.  You can keep doing this as long as their HP stays
     up.
*7 - If you use Fire attacks on Lavoids, they will give you more Exp, and get
     more powerful, and they will get a large amount of HP regeneration, so
     you should not do this until you are fairly strong.
*8 - To get the Lampkin to use Palliate, first use Remedy on them to cure
     their status, then use a Croc Tear on them when they ask for water and
     they will use it the next round.
*9 - The skill you can learn from Kolpums changes with what it's sword is
     attributed with(what type of magic it gets hit with).
        None  - Double Blow
        Fire  - Flame Strike
        Water - Frost Strike
        Earth - Searing Sand
        Wind  - Wind Strike

8-B: The Rider

  The Rider is a very difficult/fun enemy to fight.  It has very powerful
attacks, yet it is fun to fight since it's an actual challenge to beat.  You
can find it inside Mukto, through the secret passage(refer to the walkthrough
if you don't know where that is), in the room with the Dragon Tear in it.
  This strategy is just to give you an idea of what to do the first time you
face him, after that you can mix and match your own strategies to kill the
guy.

Name: Rider
Monster Type: Humanoid
HP: 40,000
Skills:
::Cleave: Non-Elemental vs Front Row(learnable)
::Primus: Breath Attack
::Disaster: lvl 3 Water + Earth magic
::Ragnarok: lvl 3 Earth + Fire magic
EXP: 10000
Zenny: 10000
Steal: King's Armor
Win  : Cursed Sword

The Rider recovers 20,000 HP after every round

  Fighting the Rider for the first time can be a bit intimidating, since you
don't really have a clue what you're up against.  Don't worry, he's not that
bad if you know what you are doing and stay calm.

Recommended Party: Ryu, Scias, Cray
Recommended Levels: 40+
Recommended Equip:
Ryu:
Weapon: Royal Sword(steal from Astral)
Armor : Royal Armor(steal from Tyrant)
Misc  : Medallion(buy from Rey/Teepo shop in abandoned village)/Dragon Tear
Skills:
- Kaiser(the controllable version)
- Shadowwalk(Bunyan, see masters for more info on getting it)
- Snooze

Scias:
Weapon: Render(99 cards from Manillo shop)
Armor : Mist Armor(bought in Chedo)
Misc  : Medallion/Shaman's Ring(S.Ring can be bought in faerie village)
Skills:
- Shining Blade(start with it, no worries)
- War Shout(Njomo, see masters for more info on getting it)
- Rest(learned from several different enemies)

Cray:
Weapon: Flail(Manillo in Shyde)
Armor : Mist Armor(bought in Chedo)
Misc  : Medallion/Shaman's Ring
Skills:
- Shield
- Super Combo(Una, see masters for more info on getting it)
- Coward' Way(Stoll, see masters for more info on getting it)

All other party members should have a medallion on for the added bonus of
having six people with them.

Round 1: Ready?
Ryu  : Put on Dragon Tear and use Snooze
Scias: Equip Shaman's Ring and use War Shout, it should combo with Snooze
Cray : Equip Shaman's Ring and use Shield, hopefully it will combo with Scias

Hopefully no one will be killed by the Rider, if they are, revive them and
  repeat the process.  If Cray is too slow to combo with Scias then switch
  his position with Scias so he will go first and Scias will combine with
  him.

Round 2: Set?
Ryu  : Meditate into Kaiser
Scias: War Shout
Cray : Shield

With the Def bonuses you have now, you shouldn't have to worry about being
  killed by the Rider. If you lose too many HP, use the next round to heal
  with Nina.

NOTE: Only use one Round 3.  If you do not need to heal, don't bother with
      3(b), and vice-versa

Round 3(a): Go!
- Make sure everyone has a Medallion equipped for the +18 Str/Def bonus.
Ryu  : Shadowwalk
Scias: Shining Blade
Cray : Super Combo/Coward's Way*

If you've been running away a lot, chances are Coward's Way will be able to
  deal more damage than Super Combo.

Round 3(b): Did we forget something?
Nina : Vigor
Scias: War Shout
Cray : Shield

You can do that in reverse order to give Ryu(Kaiser) a little bit of an extra
  Str/Def bonus when Nina's Vigor hits him.

Rounds 4+: Kill Kill Kill!!!
Basically all you need to do is repeat Round 3 from now on and you should be
  able to kill it in a few rounds.
If you aren't dealing 20,001+ damage per round tho, you will need to run away
  and gain a few more levels before you try again.
If Ryu runs out of AP, you might have to use Snooze for a couple rounds to
  gain back enough AP to use Shadowwalk, it won't be worth it to go for all
  your AP back to use Kaiser.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8-C: Trunked/Trean

  Trunked/Trean are good enemies to fight for working on high hitting combos,
but if you're like me, you want to kill everything at least once.  They never
attack you except for a counter attack when you use a normal attack on them.
The only hard part about them is that they have a lot of HP and will restore
half of it after each round.
  Killing them both is pretty simple, just raise everyone's power to the max
and then have Ursula use Triple Blow with the Culverin equipped, Ryu, Scias,
or Cray use Tiger Fist with a 2 hit weapon equipped and have Nina finish it
off with a Faerie Attack(hopefully it will be the big bomb that hits all of
them 3 times, also make sure your troops level is as high as it can be for
more damage).  Hopefully that will either kill them or lower them enough so
they can be killed in the next round.
  One thing to look out for is that after every round they will not only get
back half of their max hp, they will also lose some of the exp they give,
making them worth less to kill.  Once the amount of exp they leave reaches 0,
they will run away.

fish in River Spot 3 for a while and catch RainbowTrout and Browntail.  These
trade for a Holy Mantle or Bell Collar, which are 25 points each, meaning you
will get 1 card for every purchase of one, and an additional 1 every 4 that
you purchases.

=============================================================================
10. Skills

  Apart from regular magic, there are many skills you can learn from enemies
and from masters.  To learn the skill from an enemy simply guard during
battle and wait for someone to use the skill you want to learn.  Certain
skills that Ryu has as a dragon may be learned as well.  To learn skills from
masters, you need to fulfill the requirements that master wants.

11. Magic and Combos

11-A: Combos with Elements
11-B: Magic Armor
11-C: Item Magic
11-D: Normal Combos

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-A: Combos with Elements

  Certain Magic, when combined, will create new types of magic.  To get these
the spells must be cast consecutively in a Combo.  Below is a list of the
spell combinations to make these new spells with the least amount of AP cost.

Mini-TOC
11-A-a: Level 3 Combo Magic
11-A-b: Level 4 Combo Magic
11-A-c: Adding Elements to Melee Skills
11-A-d: Character Combos
11-A-e: Breath Attack Combos

----------------------------------------
11-A-a: Level 3 Combo Magic

Rock Blast + Burn         = Eruption
Quake      + Fireblast    = Magma Blast
Quake      + Inferno      = Ragnarok
Burn       + Sever        = Firewind
Burn       + Cyclone      = Simoon
Burn       + Typhoon      = Gigaflare
Sever      + Frost        = Jolt
Sever      + Ice Blast    = Lightning
Sever      + Blizzard     = Thunderstorm
Frost      + Rock Blast   = Storm
Frost      + Stone Pillar = Tempest
Frost      + Quake        = Disaster

---------------------------------------------------------
11-A-b: Level 4 Combo Magic

  To get level 4 combo magic, you have to combine a level 3 combo with level
3 dragon magic.  There is no way to make Mjollnir, as it would require
Pa Bing'ah, which Ryu can not get.

Ragnarok  + Hwajeh      = Supernova(Confuse)
Gigaflare + Ahryu P'ung = Earthbreaker(Stun)
Disaster  + Patoh Pah   = Catastrophe(Poison)

  There is an alternate(and better) way to get level 4 combos.

Quake    + Quake    + Hwajeh      = Supernova
Inferno  + Inferno  + Ahryu P'ung = Earthbreaker
Blizzard + Blizzard + Patoh Pah   = Catastrophe
*Level 3 magic does not have to be used for the first attack, but it is
   easier to combo with.

  Why is this mode better?  Simple.  With the first 2 elements going in a
row, you will get a 2-hit for that element, then when Ryu does the level 3
dragon magic, the level 4 combo will have 2 hits as well.

---------------------------------------------------------
11-A-c: Combos with Magic and Melee Skills

  Another combo that is not shown but actually happens is if you use an
elemental spell like Flare or Cyclone, if you put a Melee skill after that
such as Wild Swing, Super Combo, or Tiger Fist, then the Melee skill will be
the same element.  So if you combo Inferno with Tiger Fist, then the Tiger
Fist will be Fire elemental.

----------------------------
11-A-d: Character Combos

  Most characters have special skills, that trigger when you combine certain
elements with a melee skill.  To use them, have 2 other characters use
elemental skills, then have the final character use a melee skill.  If you
notice, there is a pattern, it's the same circle magic that's always followed
in this game.

Nina:
  Fire  + Wind  = Phoenix
Scias:
  Wind  + Water = Ice Sword
Cray:
  Water + Earth = Mudslide
Ursula:
  Earth + Fire  = Reflect

----------------------------
11-A-e: Breath Attack Combos

  When you put Breath attacks in Combos, as well as Super Combo, it will not
make the attacks do secondary damage like when you normally do combos with
magic of the same type, instead it will increase the number of attacks that
are performed with the Breath attack.  With Super Combo, the time limit that
you have to press buttons for more hits increases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-B: Magic Armor from the Smith

  If you go back to the Smith in Mt. Glom, then he will make you some armor
out of the materials you may have been gathering.  The armor can only be
equipped by Ershin, and it usually has special attributes not found on
regular armor.  This is also the only way(except for one enemy) to get new
armor for Ershin.

Elements:
Old Tire     - Earth
Burnt Plug   - Fire
Dirty Filter - Wind
Rusty Pipe   - Water

Other Items:
Bent Screw   - Light
Glass Shard  - Medium
Iron Scraps  - Heavy

You do not have to use these in any specific order, just as long as all the
  items are combined.

Element      + Same Element  + Same Element = Armor that absorbs that element
Element      + Same Element  + Other Item   = Armor that resists that element
Element      + Combo Element + Other Item   = Armor that will counter*
Bent Screw   + Bent Screw    + Element      = Light Armor
Bent Screw   + Bent Screw    + Bent Screw   = Lightning
Iron Scraps  + Iron Scraps   + Element      = Heavy Armor
Iron Scraps  + Iron Scraps   + Iron Scraps  = Mithril Rig
Iron Scraps  + Burnt Plug    + Glass Shard  = Defender
Glass Shard  + Glass Shard   + Glass Shard  = Psychometer
Glass Shard  + Bent Screw    + Old Tire     = Quicksilver
Dirty Filter + Old Tire      + Rusty Pipe   = Stout Mail

*These items will counter attack with the level 1 combo magic of the combined
  elements:
    Booster     - Firewind
    Gravedigger - Eruption
    Maelstrom   - Storm
    Panzer      - Jolt
  Combo elements follow the same circle of magic as if you were using magic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-C: Item Magic

  There are several items in the game that can be used in battle to cast
magic.  These items cost no AP and have the same effect of normal magic, only
they can not be used in combos.  The strength of the magical item depends on
the users Wisdom, in other words, if both Cray and Nina use the same item,
Nina's will be more powerful.

Weapon          Skill
---------------------------
BlessedStaff    Heal
Dragon Blade    Might
Earthbreaker    Stone Pillar
Flamethrower    Fireblast
King's Sword    Protect
Ouroboros       Raise Dead
PiercingEdge    Weaken

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-D: Combos Without Combining Elements

  While making a combo with elements can be nice and quite visually
entertaining, it is not always the most effective way to make a combo in
terms of damage or number of hits.  You can combo just about any type of
magic to give yourself more hits, just make more than one person cast magic
in a row and on the same turn.  Basically, if you're using Nina, Ursula, and
Ryu, in that order, Nina and Ursula can combo, Ursula and Ryu can combo, and
Nina, Ursula, and Ryu can combo.  Below are some examples of some of the more
damaging/high hitting combos.

Combo                                      # of hits(assuming nothing misses)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snooze, Rest, Vitalize                                - 36/37*1
Snooze/Rest, Vitalize, Vitalize                       - 44/45*1
Celerity, Vitalize, Vitalize                          - 70
Megaphone, Tiger Fist, Triple Blow                    - 126*2
Tiger Fist, FaerieAttack, Triple Blow                 - 126*2

------
*1 These 2 will have an extra hit if you are not immune to sleep.
*2 To get this many hits, Apprentice everyone to Bunyan and put Tiger Fist on
   Ryu, Scias, or Cray with a +1 Hits weapon equipped, and have Triple Blow
   on Ursula with a Vs. All weapon.


=============================================================================
12. Dragon Forms

  Ryu and Fou-Lu both have the ability to transform into powerful dragons.
While in these forms, they lose AP at the end of every round.  They also have
access to spells that normally they do not.  Some of these skills can be
learned by other team members if Ryu casts it on them.  Also while in dragon
form, they can cast the normal skill magic that they have learned from a
master or from an enemy.  Both will have the same number of transformations,
though the skills they have will be different.  Also Ryu has access to Fire
dragon abilities, while Fou-Lu has access to Water dragon abilities.

  Restoring Dragon HP can be done one of 2 ways, with an Ambrosia, or resting
at an inn(camping does not work.  Casting healing spells or using items on
them that are not dragon specific will not work.  Also, the Kaiser/Tyrant
forms have an auto-restore system which restores HP while you move(like

12-A: Dragon type equals

  Basically, this is the list you'll see when you select 'Meditate' for Ryu/
Fou-Lu in the battle menu.
------------------------------
Ryu            Fou-Lu
-------        -------
Aura           Astral
Kaiser         Tyrant
Wyvern         Serpent *
Myrmidon       -----
Behemoth       Behemoth
Mutant         -----

* - With Ryu you pick up the Fire Gem crystal to get Wyvern, Fou-Lu has to
    pick up the Water Gem crystal to get Serpent.  They are the same level
    of transformation, you just have to get them separately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12-D: Evolving Dragons

  Getting evolutions for dragons is quite easy.  You simply acquire the
amount of game points needed and transform into the dragon you want to
evolve.

1st - 10,000
2nd - 20,000
3rd - 35,000
4th - 50,000

  Please refer to section 15 on Mini Games for information on how to get the
points required for each transformation.

  You can evolve any of the dragons you find along the way.
Wyvern   -> Weyr(Ryu only)
Behemoth -> Mammoth
Myrmidon -> Knight(Ryu only)
Mutant   -> Punk(Ryu only)
Serpent  -> Peist(Fou-Lu only)

  There is also a way to evolve the Mutant/Punk breath attack, Stardrop,
using game points as well
1 - start
2 - .....
3 - .....
4 - 50,000
5 - .....
6 - 62,000
7 - 75,000

Some levels don't have point reqs for the simple fact that I forgot to write
  them down, oops.  Also, I'm not sure whether there is a level 7 breath
  attack as a friend of mine has used a gameshark to get 99,999 game points
  but did not have a level 7 attack.  It could just be a glitch in using a
  gameshark, so if anyone has gotten 75,000+ game points without using a
  gameshark, please let me know whether you got a level 7 breath or not.

  Both Ryu and Fou-Lu can evolve dragons, and if one of them evolves a
certain dragon, the other will also receive that evolution.  In other words,
if Fou-Lu evolves the Behemoth into the Mammoth, Ryu's will as well.  The
Serpent/Peist evolution will also automatically evolve the Wyvern into the
Weyr and vise versa.

=============================================================================
13. Miscellaneous

  None of this stuff was big enough to get its own section and wasn't part of
another section either, so it wound up here.

-------------
Semi-TOC
Trade Ball Locations
N. Chamba Fishing Spot Boss
Wyndian Butler
Rei and Teepo Shop
Mini-Games
Sarai Valley Digging
Last Boss Stealing

Trade Ball Locations:
- Frog man in the Sarai tavern
- Man under first archway in Shyde
- Man in the Shrine on Golden Plains
- Prisoner in Wyndia castle
- Man in Crash(where the broken sandflier is)
- Man in Shikk
- Man in Chiqua(that wanted the pottery/fish/relic)
- Lady in Sonne
- A kid in the abandoned village has it
- The kid next to Lyta in the orphanage(Synesta)

  You can do these in any order you want to, there is no specific order you
have to trade balls in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To get the N. Chamba fishing spot, go back there after you get a new
sandflier.  Talk to the man sitting outside and then go up the ladder and
explore inside.  You will have to fight a boss.
Boss: Angler
HP: 19000
Attacks:
::Feint - physical attack that confuses
::Chlorine - physical attack that poisons
::Curse - Halves all enemies HP
- You can steal a Deep Diver from him.
- You can learn Feint, Chlorine, and Curse from it.

Win:
EXP: 12000
Zenny: 1420
Items: Fish-head

  After you defeat the boss, go back outside and talk to the man again.  You
will now be able to use it as a fishing spot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The butler in Wyndia will buy eating utensils from you and pay in Aurum.
Item        Aurum
-----------------
Toothpick   1
Chopsticks  2
Straw       4
Spoon       8
Fork        16
  You can only sell him 1 of each though, giving you 31 Aurum from him if you
sell him everything.  That is still probably more than enough for you though.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rei and Teepo from Breath of Fire 3 will open up a shop in the Abandoned
Village during the Clear Game.  You can buy the best fishing lure here, the
King Frog, for only 800z, which is cheap at the end of the game.
  Also, if you talk to Teepo(the short guy with purple hair), he will give
you a Rusted Sword.  If you kill 1000 enemies with it, it will power up to a
Slayer, which is a very good weapon for Scias/Ryu.  You may use attack all
abilities like Tiger fist to get 1000 kills faster.
  Once you get the Rusted Sword to become a Slayer, you can talk to Teepo
again to get another Rusted Sword and repeat the process as many times as you
want to(or you get 99 of them).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Once you beat certain mini-games, you can play them again to get extra
bonus points.  They all have the same rules as before, but they give you less
game points than when you played them as a part of the story.
  The ones that I know of so far are the:

:Wharf - crate loading game
:West of Pauk - The chicken herding game(you will herd pigs now)
:Mt. Ryft - The rafting game
:The sandflier courses are a good way to rack up on points, but you can only
   get 4000 for each of the six courses.  This is 24000 points though, which
   is a lot.  To get a good score, go off as many jumps as you can and rotate
   the controller a lot.  When you get into a turn, it's always good to brake
   right before you turn(X), this will save time and help you keep control.
   As a bonus, if you can finish the courses in 30 seconds or less, you will
   get 6000 points.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You can go back to the Valley south of Sarai and talk to the old man to do
the digging game again.  You won't get any game points, but you can use it to
get free(well, 50z) items.  You can even get Stat boosting items from here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you forgot to steal, or couldn't steal from the last boss, you can go
back in a clear game and keep trying.  Actually, you can keep fighting him
and stealing as many times as you want.

=============================================================================
14. Tips and Tricks

  This is just a bunch of random stuff I've put together that isn't big
enough so that they'd get their own section, but of a bit more importance
than the Misc. section.

14-A: Stealing
14-B: Exp
14-C: Weapons

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14-A: Stealing:

  Anyone who has tried to steal know that it takes a really long time to do
and requires a lot of patience.  However, the rewards can be quite good.  To
make stealing a little bit easier, there are a couple things you can do.

1. Have the more sly characters do the stealing.
  I'm not sure if this is an actual factor in stealing, but Ursula and Scias
  tend to be better at stealing than Nina and Ryu.

2. Use a "Treasure" magic combo.
  Treasure magic consists of Steal, Pilfer, Charm, and Monopolize.  Usually
  when magic is combo'd it makes the spells more powerful and potent.  Since
  treasure magic doesn't actually deal damage, using it in a combo will raise
  the % chance for you to steal an item.  I'm not sure by how much, but I
  have noticed a difference.  This trick will also work with Charm to have
  an increased chance of an item dropping after the fight.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14-B: Exp:

  The max exp you can get in a battle is 196,605 from the Bots in Sinchon.
The max exp you can get per enemy is 65,535 from either the Bots in Sinchon,
the Lavoids on Mt. Yogy, or the Orochi in the Castle Basement.

--------------------------------
  Eye Goos in the beginning of the game will give you 1.5 times the amount
of exp they normally do if you hit them with the skill Blind.
--------------------------------
  Puspools(found around Dam/Kyria) will double their exp when you hit them
with Fire elemental attacks.  It will also make them easier to hit.  This
trick will only up their Exp once.
--------------------------------
  Go to Mt. Yogy(north of Sonne), and fight the Lavoids there.  If you use
fire on them, you will get more Exp from them, and you can keep going up
until you get 65,535 exp from each.  Each hit from fire increases their exp
by 1/2 of what it was before.
--------------------------------
  In Sinchon the Bot enemies will transform if you hit them with an elemental
combo(Firewind, etc), and that will double their Exp.  They will transform
back after 2 turns(the turn before they will have a text box with "zee...zee
zee...po...zee..." at the start of the round), so hit them with another combo
and they will transform again and double their new amount of Exp.  Eventually
they will get to the max Exp of 65,535 each.  Just make sure you heal them so
they don't die from the combos.
---------------------------------
  On B3 of the Imperial Castle, the Orochi will power up with every physical
attack that hits them without killing them.  Only normal attacks will work,
abilities like Backhand(to make sure they don't die) and Shadowwalk will not
work.  Every time you hit them their exp will go up by 1/5 of what it was
previously.  Watch out though, they will still continue to grow in power even
after their EXP reaches 65535 with each physical attack they're hit with.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14-C: Weapons:


  The Render sword you can buy from the Manillo Shops for 99 coupons can be
the most powerful weapon in the game.  It's attack power is 50 + (the number
of encounters you've had)/20.  In simpler terms, lets say you've fought 3360
enemies, then the Render will have a power of 50 + (3360/20), or 218.  It
will not show this bonus in the equip screen, but it will be there.  If
you're worried about fighting enemies that absorb Water(the Render is a Water
elemental attack) put another elemental changing skill, like Flame Strike, on
Scias and you will no longer deal water damage.
--------------------------------
  The Slayer sword you can get in the clear game.  Go to the Abandoned
Village northwest of Chek.  Talk to the little purple guy in there(Teepo) and
he will give you a Rusted Sword.  Kill 1000 enemies with this weapon and it
will transform into the Slayer.  The fastest and easiest way to transform it
is to give Ryu/Scias Tiger Fist(from Khan) and apprentice them to Bunyan.
In the desert area near Dam, you will fight no less than 2 enemies, and quite
a few times you will fight a group of 6 Caps/Red Caps.  You will get your
1000 enemies killed faster going against weak enemies like Caps.
  Once you get your Slayer, there are a few things you might want to know
about it.  It will steal 10% of the damage it deals and add that to it's
holder's HP.  There is also a small chance it will hit an ally in the
process, which can be fatal.  To avoid hitting allies, use a skill like
Shadowwalk/Shining Blade, or even just Wild Swing.
--------------------------------
  The Cursed Sword you get from the Rider in Mukto.  It has a power of 90,
and at the end of every round, it will drain 6% of Ryu's current HP(only Ryu
can equip it).  While this may sound bad, the Cursed Sword can actually be
stronger than the Royal Sword.  How?
  Simple, the Cursed Sword takes the % of Ryu's current HP over his Max HP
and slams that into it's attack power.  Confused?  In simpler terms it is a
math problem.  Say Ryu has a max of 1000 HP, but at the time he only has 867.
Divide 867 by 1000(867/1000) to find out what % 867 is of 1000.  In this case
867 is 87.6% of 1000.  Now multiply .867 by your attack power with the sword
equipped(say you have a base of 210, with the sword on you'll have 300), in
this case that would be 260.1.  Now add that into your attack power to find
out what your attack power really is.  With this case it's 560.1.
  Nice?  It gets better.  The attack bonus can go over the game's normal 999
limit for weapons(basically if you have 999 base power, it won't matter
whether you have the Broken Sword or Dragon Blade equipped, they'll deal the
same damage), meaning that if you have your max HP and 999 power, you really
have an attack power of 1998!
--------------------------------
  The Royal Sword has a hidden Holy Element added to it, so enemies weak to
Holy(Undead, a couple others)... well, we all know what happens when you mix
Holy with undead...
--------------------------------
  The Slicer also has a hidden ability in it, it will ignore an enemies
defense, meaning it will deal as much damage against a Cap as it will against
the last boss.

15. Mini-Games

  Once you beat certain mini-games as a part of the story, you can go back
play them again for extra game points used to evolve Dragons.  They all still
have the same rules, only after the first time through, they don't give as
many game points.

Crane Game
Location: Wharf - North of Synesta
Max Game Points: 700
Difficulty: Moderate
Time: 3 min at max

- Talk to the big guy in the T-Shirt to start the game.
- Moving left and right on the D-Pad swing the crane, moving up shortens it,
  and moving down lengthens it.
- Hitting Circle without a crate makes the arm go down, and hitting Circle
  with one makes it lower the crate.
- Get the container next to Cray, and move it over to the spot on the ship
  out lined with a blue square, and drop it.
- You get more points if you drop it on the light blue square, so aim for
  that one.
- Also try to allow only 10-15 seconds for each barrel.
- You've got 3:00 so work fast!  It's better to let the crane steady itself a
  little so you can see where it will land, then lower it down.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
River Rafting Game
Location: Mt. Ryft - North of Shyde
Max Game Points: 400
Difficulty: Easy -> Moderate
Time: 30 seconds

- You have to make it down the river in one(or more) piece, every time you
  hit something you lose a piece, when it gets completely destroyed ya gotta
  start over.
- Try to keep the raft near the middle of the river, the bags bounce back and
  forth between the river banks and you can usually get them close to the
  center.
- Know when it's smart to go for bags, don't go for it unless you know you
  won't hit a bank or if you just don't care about losing pieces :)
- Each bag is worth 20 points and the big bag is worth 100.
- You get 20 bonus points for every piece of the raft you have left after the
  game is over.
- There is no time bonus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pig Catching Game
Location: "?" area - West of Pauk
Max Game Points: 690
Difficulty: Easy
Time: 1-5 min depending on how many extra pigs you want.
- The mini-game ends when you capture the mother pig(the brown one).  If you
  get other piggy's, you get more points.
- The pigs will always run away from you, and if you run around to a side,
  they will change direction accordingly.
- If you go far enough away they will stop running and go back to a walking
  pace.
- If you leave them alone, the little pigs will always run in the direction
  of the mother(brown) pig.  You can use this to lure them near the pen.
- You get 10 points for each pig you get in the pen and 200 points for mommy.
- You also get a bonus depending on how many extra pigs you caught.
- There is no time bonus.

16. Breath of Fire Saga theories and stuff like that.

  This section will delve into the depths of the Breath of Fire storylines
and will provide factual proof that the stories are connected in one way or
another.  Err...  Ignore that.  It's here because there are a lot of
coincidences in the 4 Breath of Fire games other than repeating names, and
people have noticed them.

NOTE: THESE CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE BREATH OF FIRE GAMES

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is Breath of Fire 3 a prequal to Breath of Fire 4?
By Billy Lee(FAQ Author)

  This has really been bugging me.  There are many things that make me think
that it is.  For starters, there is no Myria in this game.  She was the
Goddess in Breath of Fire 3 that tried to control the world.  At the end of
the game she was killed, which would explain why she was not in this game.
Also, in Breath of Fire 3, the World was two halves, east and west, that were
separated by a giant ocean and Myria said that if she did not keep the desert
back with the ocean, then it would cover the earth.  Well, in Breath of Fire
4, the world is covered in Mud, and much of the world is desert.  How do we
make Mud?  Water and Sand, and what could make more mud than a desert that
ran into an ocean.  And if you notice, Wyndia is on the eastern continent
like it always is.
  Another hint that the two stories are connected is through the appearance
of some of the non saga-orientated characters(i.e. Mogu, Gary, Bunyan) such
as Rei(renamed Rey, but it's the same person/tiger) and Teepo.  These two
open up a shop and sell things in the clear game of BoF4.  Could this just be
an easter egg from Capcom?  It probably is, but the fact that the two are
there suggests some sort of connection.
  There is also the occurrence of Momo as a master in BoF4.  She herself says
that she was working in her laboratory when there was an explosion and she
was knocked out, and the next thing she remembered was being in a different
place, like a parallel dimension or something.
  Then there is how the dragons are brought from one world to the world of
Breath of Fire 4.  It is explained that the dragons were brought to be gods
in this world from another one.  Deis and Ryu were not brought correctly and
thus, Ryu was split in two and Deis wound up in a talking and walking garbage
can.  Maybe there exists some type of Dimensional Rift in BoF3's Dragnier
that connects it to BoF4's Chek, the two certainly look enough alike for that
to be possible.
  Another similarity in the two is how many of the skills from 3 are in 4,
even some of the same enemies.  This is not very major, but I still think it
is worth mentioning.
  This isn't really all that major, but the design on the Breath of Fire 3 cd
is similar to the disign of the Breath of Fire 4 cd, only in 3 Ryu is on the
cover and in 4, Fou-Lu is on the cover.
  This is only what I can remember, there may be more connections that I've
not found yet or can't remember at this time.

Chinese dragons in a Japanese game?
By: Billy Lee(FAQ Author)

  It recently came to my attention that Ryong is the Chinese word for Dragon.
This made me wonder, "Why would Capcom use the Chinese word for dragon?"  I
thought that maybe it was just because they didn't want to use the Japanese
word(Ryu) because that was already in use.
  All of the seven dragon gods have Chinese names.  P'ung Ryong, Sa Ryong,
Ni Ryong, Cho Ryong, Su Ryong, Hae Ryong, and the Nameless One(rock dragon).
There is also the fact that Mami calls Fou-Lu Ryong because she doesn't know
his real name.  I wonder what brought Capcom about to do this?  All I can do
is guess, which I don't want to do for fear of offending someone.

Breath of Fire series connections
By: James Huval(jameshuval10@hotmail.com)
BLee Note: Text is in original form updated with new info from the author
  spelling corrections at the request of the author.


*   This is my own belief as far as the BoF's being connected. It
saterted with BoF. They had the Light dragons and the Dark dragons. The
forces were meant to destroy each other. Eventually, the Dark Dragons are
destroyed and the Obelisk was raised by Zog's (former dark dragon leader)
right hand man Jade. Jade was destroyed by Ryu and friends and went
forward and found Tyr (Myria) the goddess. Using the power of Agni
(translation error: Infini) they banished Myria. Thought to have destroyed
Myria, the dragons put away their power. Note: Bleu (now known as Deis)
helped their group banish this god. Note: The map is VERY similar to BoF4's
map. 

BoF2 came. BoF2 had Ryu again. Behind his home town there was a mountain
with shut doors. Ryu's mother came from it to observe the world because an
evil was growing. Ryu's mother really came from an underground town which
I believe were the ancestor's of Drogan the Home Town of BoF's Ryu. They
sealed their selves away to protect the world from a seed of Hatred placed
by Myria before she died. This seed grew into a being's form who named
itself Deathevn which was actually supposed to be Death Evan. Evan was the
name this evil used in the world above to corrupt everyone using a false
religion under the god of St. Evans or shortly known as St. Eve.  Ryu and
his party destroyed this monstrosity as well. Note: Deis was an accessible
character in this game but not a required character. Different endings
occurred, but I beleive that Ryu took the place where his mother slept and
Deis helped Ryu and his party to destroy Death Evan with the power of
Ryu's Afini (Translation mix: Infini). Note: The Map looked similar but
flipped so that it looked some what like BoF's map. Note: There were Trees
of Wisdom spread across the world. 

BoF3 came. This world was completely different in the idea that the world
map was not really easy to see and understand. I beleive that there was
more than what the eye could see and and that there was a different way
to access the Desert of death than by going straight through the ocean. I
beleive that there was a chain of islands not included in BoF3 for us to
see which would explain the worldly difference and on the other side was
connected by nothing but land past the checkpoint where you couldn't go.
Looking at it, I believe that the desert of Death was created by Death
Evan's death so that the world rot where above his death area above where
he died. In the beginning of the game there was a large Dragon Skeleton in
mining area. This was at a mountain in a pretty desolate area closely
resembling a desert but not really. Myria used this desert to her
advantage to control human beings by making it spread as far as taking
over half the world. Myria was afraid of the Dragons so of course she had
Guardians fight them. After all, she can't have Humans knowing that she
was trying to control them. Most of the Dragon race was destroyed but a
few of them surrendered themselves and hid a strong Dragon elder
underground where the goddess could not locate him. In the meantime, Ryu
was found by Gary and Mogu (no relation to the first two as far as I can
tell other than little gifts of Capcom). Ryu busted out and it rolls down
hill from there. Ryu and friends fight the goddess along with Peco, the
seed of Yadagrassgil, the Tree of Wisdom, who was spread across the world
making it more probable to be a world that came from BoF2. Myria was
defeated and her power was sucked. Her sister Deis came to stand by her
and be destroyed with her so that the humans could live on their own. Ryu
and the Gang decided to search the desert for more answers. Peco planted
himself in the ground. End game. Note: There was a gene called Infini
which was obtained by the eldest Dragon. This eldest dragon was probly the
old man from BoF2 who helped Ryu in that game undergo his trials to obtain
Afini (infini). 

UPDATE: Hey, I realized something after getting some mail that I forgot to
  add in the BoF3 part of the theory I made was the big wall painting before
  you go to see the dragon elder. The wall painting showed an exact portrayal
  of the 1st BoF characters fighting the goddess Tyr(Myria) which DOES prove
  that BoF3 and BoF are directly related.

BoF4 came. This is where things become a little crazy. Before Myria's
technological placed became exploded into bits, Deis was incorrectly
summoned to this Parrallel dimension *in the desert into Chamba into a
piece of armour* Ryu and friends had little time to explore before Ryu
was summoned to their parrallel dimension incorrectly so that his other
side was split. I also beleive that there was some MAJOR problems with
the summoning so that only half of Ryu was summoned to their world in the
beginning so that there was Fou Lou. I beleive that Fu Lou was summoned as
soon as Ryu exploded out of his Chrism Ore explaining why of all the
dragons he was summoned. Another summon went and Ryu was summoned From the
Desert of Death to ANOTHER desert. Coincidence? Ryu was around the same
age now as he was in BoF3. When this half of Ryu was summoned, Fou Lou
reawakened from his slumber to await him and become whole again and have
all goddesses banished from the world to allow humans to live on their own.
This would explain the idea that this was the same Ryu from BoF3 because
he eventually does the same thing they were set out to do in BoF3. Momo
was also messed up during this and that was how she came about. It is a
Parrallel world so Windia had to be around as well. Also the Worren tribe
was probly the same race that Katt was in BoF2. And to complete the
matters. there was a Tree of Wisdom in the north above the dessert. This
was the parrallel Peco plantation in effect explaining the forest and the
only part of the world where clean water was associated inside the land.
Outside the circled land was clean water. The parrallel worlds would also
explain the Fearie village.

The Breath of Fire Storyline
By: Aerilon
BLee Note: This text is unchanged from the original email I recieved except
  for the formatting so that it fits in the 80 char format.

  I believe I have figured out the storyline for the Breath of Fire games.
Contrary to my earlier belief that it began with #1, so far in the storyline,
as far as I can figure, #4 is the 'first' game in the timeline.  Note,
please, that I have thus far been unable to get ahold of #2 to fit it into
this timeline.
 
  In Breath of Fire 4 the dragons were gods.  They were originally summoned
from other worlds, as you know, in one of the endings, the 'true' ending, Ryu
ended this.  Lord Yuna however claimed he could still create gods.  From what
I can figure, he created Myria, or Tyr, the Goddess.  The Dragons themselves
were not destroyed, they were no longer gods.  Their forms changed.  In #3,
Myria, created by Yuna, had all but wiped out the Dragons, knowing they posed
a threat to her.  However, two dragons were not wiped out.  Teepo and the Ryu
of that time.  yes, I know Teepo and Rei appeared in 4, but that was more an
easter egg than anything else from what I can figure.  From what I can
figure, this was early in their lives that they appeared in #4.  It was
before #3.  I recall that, in Breath of Fire 4, Deis had been summoned to the
world.  This is what convinced me that this was the first, actually.  As in
#3, Deis had been sealed for many years.  Obviously by Myria or her servants.
 
  In Breath of Fire 2, I do not know what happened, unfortunately.  I want to
get my hands on that game.
 
  However, I can tell that between the time that the events of #3 and #1
occurred, the dragons had split into two clans.  The Light and Dark dragons.
No, Fou-Lu wasn't a Dark dragon though he may have seemed to be.  Teepo
however was a Dark dragon.  The Dark dragons became as such by becoming the
servants of Myria.  I am unsure of how they split, unfortunately.  In Breath
of Fire 1, there was a legend about Tyr, or Myria.  Obviously, the legend
referred to #3, when a previous Ryu had defeated her with the aid of his
friends.  Or, it could have been #2, since I have no idea what happened in
that one... oh well, i'm sure you get the point by now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BoF4 Storyline Theory... (BIG SPOILERS!)
By: Darkstorm
BLee Note: The text has not been changed at all, only the formatting so it
  will fit properly.

  As the title says.. lots of spoilers (for BoF4 and BoF3), and lots of
speculation - most backed up by points in the game, some just out of my head.
It's very long. Be warned. :)

  First oddity: Deis didn't recognize Ryuu or his nature (despite meeting and
aiding at least *four* other dragon clan warriors (BoF1, 2, 3, and the
backstory for BoF1). Nor was she her usual snakey self.

  The Dragon Clan have never been gods before; take a look at Jono to see
what a 600-year-old member of the Dragon Clan looks like, as opposed to the
600-year-old Fou-Lu.

  At the end of the game, Ryuu "casts out" the gods. While the people of the
world say 'The gods are dead! The dragons have left us!', Nina says they were
simply changed into mortals, their power sealed away.

  Fou-Lu and Ershin both say at various points in the game that the aura of
the Endless affects the very world around them, drawing out hidden power.

  Yuna is left alive at the end, ready, willing, and able to create more
Endless to "replace" the ones that were lost.

  When I first saw the ending, I was angry - I went through all that to kill
the dragons? Then I realized what happened. I added up the points I just
made, and came up with the following:

  This wasn't the death of the dragons; what I just witnessed was the birth
of the Dragon Clan. Mortals with the power of gods sealed inside them. This
is how Deis *got* to the world, not a story that takes place after her
'death' in BoF3. This is the World Covered By Sand Myria spoke of in BoF3 - a
world where the oceans were so kludged with mud that nothing can travel on
them.

  The rest is speculation for the most part on where the series will go from
here, to connect it to Breath of Fire 1, but some of it is based on events in
BoF4.

  The Worens and Ludia went to war. The Worens lost, and Ludia probably
didn't fare too well, either. In the other games, the Worens are scattered,
their homeland lost, and Ludia is nowhere to be seen. The Worens mostly hid,
an endangered species, though somehow they never died out entirely. (In BoF1
there are no Worens, in BoF2 there are two, in BoF3 there is one - in the
*entire world*, as far as your party knows).

  Meanwhile, little old Yuna has been busy. And Old he probably was, by the
time he finished his greatest creation of all: A huge malformed 'goddess',
to take the place of the gods Ryuu had cast out. The presence of this being
in the world led to the until-now powerless Dragon Clan discovering their
inner abilities.

  I suspect, though I can't be certain, that Yuna will also be responsible
for creating the half-snake body that Deis wears later on; this *would* make
the two of them 'sisters' in a sense, since they had the same 'father'.

  With the Dragons' power restored, this would certainly lead to the quest
described in the backstory to BoF1: Myria (Yuna's creation), taking a less-
threatening form, offered wishes to the Dragon Clan in order to set them
against each other, splitting them into ones who take Ryuu's path (the Light
Dragons) and the ones who follow the selfish ways of Fou-Lu (the Dark
Dragons). This lasted until one of the Light Dragons, and seven companions
(including the Goddess Deis, weakened by being bound to a physical form, but
still powerful nonetheless), sealed Myria away into another dimension with
the Seven Goddess keys. At this point, the dragons, Light and Dark alike,
started slowly losing their powers as the aura of the Endless left the world.

  By the time Breath of Fire rolls around, most of them are powerless again,
save for a few who worship the Goddess directly, and have some access to her
power - notably, Emperor Zog, who rebuilt the Fou Empire in his own name.

  From here, of course, the games are chronological, leading to the death of
Myria in BoF3. I suspect and hope that BoF5 will confirm the above, and be
the game in which you control that Light Dragon in his quest to seal Myria
away.

  And.. what about Ryuu? The "original" (BoF4) Ryuu, that is. Well, I have
no proof of this at all, but I like to think that when he died, his spirit
was still able to contact the physical world, causing the other dragons to
worship him as a god, though one with no actual physical influence on the
course of events.

And he became known as Ladon, the Dragon Lord.

  Feel free to disagree, but at least try to be creative when you do (i.e.,
don't just say 'I think you're wrong!' with no discussion to back it up) :)
Oh, and I don't think that Rei and Teepo "prove" anything about this game's
connection to the others (any more than Bo and Karn's cameo in BoF2 proves
it takes place in the same time period as BoF); they seem more like an inside
joke for people who played BoF3, and have about as much connection to the
story as Chun Li's cameos in BoF1 and 3. Momo, of course, simply got blown
back in time (possibly before meeting Ryuu and Nina in 3, but that's another
paradox altogether).
